Geography in the Field: A Course-Based Extension Program – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/geography-in-the-field-a-course-based-extension-program/,"


Geography focuses on the study of the earth as the home of humans. A holistic discipline, it examines human-environment interactions, spatial processes, and the development of places and localities. It studies the physical and human processes of the earth and investigates how these produce different landscapes. It uses geographic techniques such as spatial analysis, cartography, geographic information science (GIScience), remote sensing, and statistical methods to explore and comprehend the complexities of natural and cultural systems and how they relate to each other. These can lead to better understanding of the factors that lead to the transformation of everyday spaces on the local, regional, and global levels.

The UP Department of Geography aims to bring geography to where it should be—at the center of decision-making in our country. The department takes an active role in propagating geography as a discipline in order to raise awareness on how our daily lives are influenced by human-environment interactions, and to empower localities in facing the challenges of an increasingly globalizing world.

Origins of Geography Field School

The Local Government Code of 1991 (RA 7160) provides geography as a discipline the opportunity to showcase its relevance to society. In 1995, the department initiated partnerships with various local government units, non-government and peoples’ organizations, and other institutions. These partnerships involve the engagement of students of the department with partner communities. It has resulted in successful outputs such as planning documents and maps, which are vital for development planning especially in the remote areas of the country. It also serves as a venue for students to learn the skills of geographic inquiry, data collection, and analysis while serving the participating communities.

The Department’s Physical and Socio-Economic Profile (PSEP), now referred to as the Ecological Profile (EP), is a document in which the department often collaborates with local government units. This document is essential in formulating the Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP) mandated by the Local Government Code; CLUP will be enacted through zoning ordinances.

The first of these collaborations took place in 1995 with the local government of Jordan, Guimaras, which was then a sub-province of Iloilo. The field class came up with the PSEP and accompanying maps used by the LGU as inputs to their CLUP. After this successful engagement, the department continued to reach out to other LGUs, expanding its services by assisting them with their development goals.

Geography Field School

Geography 192/202, Field Methods in Geography (or Field Geography at the graduate level), is a course-based extension program offered by the Department of Geography every mid-year/summer term. The course allows the faculty and undergraduate students of the department to support the development planning processes at the provincial, municipality and community levels. It also fulfills the goals of service learning in enhancing academic learning among students and faculty while extending assistance to communities in a professional manner.

Since its inception, the program has assisted 48 barangays, municipalities and cities all over the Philippines. The department has collaborated with different local government units (LGUs), peoples organizations (POs), academic and research institutions, non-government organizations (NGOs), and community members towards the enhancement of their capacities to make informed decisions through research, technical assistance, and utilization of geographic information resources and tools such as geographic information systems.

In recent years, the course objectives have broadened and diversified to accommodate the changing nature of development projects initiated or supported by the LGUs or local organizations. The following are the extension activities that are being carried out under the program.

Ecological Profiling/Physical and Socio-economic Profiling

The ecological profile (EP), formerly known as the physical and socio-economic profile (PSEP) is a comprehensive database composed of systematic description and analysis of the different sectors of an area or municipality, namely: social, physical, economic, institutional and environmental sectors.

The ecological profile is also the more comprehensive replacement of the socio-economic profile as it gives equal coverage to the physical, biological, socio-economic, cultural and built environments (DILG).

The Local Planning and Development Coordinator (LPDC) of the LGU is responsible for the preparation of this document. However, due to lack of personnel, data and technology, some LGUs reach out to other institutions for assistance in the formulation of the EP.

As of 2016, 28 municipalities have been given assistance with their PSEP/EP by the department.

Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP)

The Comprehensive Land Use Plan is a planning document prepared by the LGUs to rationalize the allocation and proper use of land uses. It also projects public and private land uses in accordance with future spatial organization of economic and social activities.

It is mandated in Article 41 of the Local Government Code of 1991 (RA 7160) that LGUs shall prepare their CLUP which will be enacted through zoning ordinances. Similar with the lack of capacities to prepare such documents, some LGUs engage with other institutions for assistance in the formulation of their CLUP.

The department assisted the formulation of CLUP of Lucban, Quezon in 2001.

Minimum Basic Needs Profile

The Minimum Basic Needs Profiling provides a strategy of prioritizing primary requirements for survival, security and enabling needs of the community. It is also a way of using basic needs as basis for situation analysis, planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation.

The department conducted the preparation of the Minimum Basic Needs Profile of Barangay Iniwaran, San Pascual, Masbate in 2005.

Community Resource Management Framework Plan

The Community Resource Management Framework Plan is a strategic plan of the community on how to manage and benefit from the forest resources on a sustainable basis. It describes the community’s long-term vision, aspirations, commitments and strategies for the protection, rehabilitation, development and utilization of forest resources. It also provides detailed activities for the first five (5) years) which shall serve as a five-year work plan of the people’s organizations(POs).

The department assisted in the formulation of the CRMF of Barangay Calawis, Antipolo City, Rizal in 2009.

Participatory 3D Mapping

Participatory 3D mapping is a community-based mapping method which integrates local spatial knowledge with data on elevation of the land and depth of the sea to produce stand-alone, scaled and geo-referenced relief models.

In 2015, the UP Department of Geography, in partnership with UNICEF, facilitated the participatory 3D mapping in the municipalities of Paracale and Basud, Camarines Norte.

Geographic Information System (GIS) Orientation/Workshop

Geographic Information System or GIS, is a computer system for capturing, storing, checking and displaying data related to positions on the earth’s surface. GIS can show many different kinds of data on one map, such as streets, buildings, and vegetation. This enables people to easily see, analyze, and understand patterns and relationships which can be vital for the development of an area.

The UP Manila Community Health and Development Program (UP CHDP) – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/the-up-manila-community-and-development-program-up-chdp/,"


The UP CHDP is the UP Manila unit mandated by the University to enter into partnerships with Philippine municipalities to set up and maintain community-based health programs (CBHPs) that will benefit both parties. It provides the site for UP faculty, staff and students’ curricular (academic) immersion and service activities.

In 2007, the UP CHDP was revived by then UP Manila Chancellor Ramon L. Arcadio. The UP CHDP Conceptual Framework considers the community as a partner in health and development towards a healthier and more empowered community.

The objectives of the UP CHDP are to assist communities in attaining enhanced capacities in their own health care and development through the Primary Health Care Approach while providing learning opportunities for the faculty and students of UP in the principles and practice of community health and development which they can also use in their extension and volunteer work.

The community partner of the UP CHDP from 2007-2013 was the Municipality of San Juan, Batangas (San Juan started working with UP Manila through the UP College of Medicine in 2006) while the partner from 2013 to the present is the Province of Cavite through the A.M.I.G.A. Inter-L.G.U. Health Collaboration Council.

The municipality of San Juan and the UP CHDP successfully worked together from 2006 to 2013 “to decrease by 50 percent the morbidity of children 0-12 years old.” In addition to the municipal-wide program on children’s health, there was also a municipal-wide program on dengue prevention. The dengue program involved the formation of a Barangay Dengue Task Force in all the barangays. These groups created the mechanism whereby community members were able to participate actively in the program. School-Based Dengue Task Force groups were also formed in every public and private school in the municipality. Several public elementary schools were able to form teams of “Bulilit Health Scouts” which assisted in the implementation of school-based projects, including the school-based dengue prevention efforts.

There were also several barangay-wide initiatives such as solid-waste management programs and livelihood programs, as well as school-based programs anchored on the “Fit for School” initiative of the Department of Education.

There were also regular primary care clinical services in barangay health stations. The Rural Health Unit staff and the UP students worked together to provide primary care services with the assistance of the local government unit (LGU) and the health workers in the barangay.

The Municipality of San Juan was led by two mayors during the partnership years from 2006 to 2013, the Hon. Rodolfo Manalo (2006-2007 & 2010-2013) and the Hon. Danilo Mindanao (2007-2010). Dr Nestor Alidio served as the overall leader of the health team.

BIDANI: A Strategy for Promoting Local Development and Nutrition Improvement – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/bidani-a-strategy-for-promoting-local-development-and-nutrition-improvement/,"


Malnutrition is a multi-faceted problem and cannot be solved only by health and nutrition practitioners. It needs multidisciplinary and multisectoral but integrative approaches in order to minimize if not solve this problem. The causes of malnutrition, being multiple and complex, are better addressed with the collaborative efforts of several disciplines.

One concrete example is the malnutrition problem due to poverty in an upland area. The people are poor despite planting cash crops under the forest trees. Their productivity is low because the cash crops they plant are not suitable and the soil had become infertile because of inappropriate planting methods. Nutritionist Dietitians (NDs) can advice them about nutrition, but foresters must also advise them about upland crops and methods so they will have a better source of livelihood.

Research and extension professionals of the Barangay Integrated Development Approach for Nutrition Improvement (Bidani) recognize the common goal: Assuring human existence in a sustainable environment. This requires an integrated disciplinary approach to get to the root causes of problems and identify appropriate, lasting solutions.

The study of man alone necessitates the use of both the natural and social sciences.

Since its inception as a Nutrition Improvement Model, an action-research project of the University of the Philippines Los Baños (UPLB) sponsored by the Food and Agriculture Organization in 1978, until it became a full blown network program of state universities and colleges (SUCs), Bidani’s niche has always been human ecology: the study of man and his interaction with the environment. Beginning with the physical matter of health and nutrition, we realize it is better viewed from a socio-economic standpoint. Health and nutrition are the best indicators of socio-economic progress. Only healthy and well-nourished individuals can participate in and contribute to socio-economic development.

Although we began with the goal of nutrition improvement (NI), it did not become the sole focus of Bidani. As we aspire to be holistic, NI led us to look for improvement in other interrelated areas of concern, including physical infrastructure such as farm to market roads, peace and order, livelihood, potable water, among others.

SUCs concerted efforts for the promotion of healthy and well-nourished community, i.e. conferences and consultations meetings. Photo courtesy of Ms. Lorna Garcia.

During the earlier times of the College of Human Ecology (CHE), the three departments and one institute collaborated for the practicum of both the Bachelor of Science in Human Ecology (BSHE) and Bachelor of Science in Nutrition (BSN) programs. The objective was to produce graduates with holistic perspectives who can articulate each of the departments’ objectives. The BSHE curriculum includes nutrition. At the same time, the BSN curriculum includes an introduction to human ecology because knowledge of the concept will enable students to understand the deep-rooted problems of man and his relationship with the physical, social, biological and economic environments which affect human nutrition.

Under the Department of Human and Family Development Studies (HFDS), the locus of operation is the family. BIDANI aims to help sustain healthy and well- nourished families to enable them to participate in socio-economic development. This is the same target set by the Institute of Human Nutrition and Food (IHNF). The Department of Social Development Services (DSDS) targets communities to receive or avail of social services through different technologies and to take care of the environment, which is the domain of the Department of Community and Environmental Resource Planning (DCERP). Each domain interacts with one another. Synergy is the essence of human ecology, and Bidani is utilized by the entire college for teaching, research, and extension.

At present, UPLB-Bidani has established linkages with colleges in UPLB—e.g., the College of Public Affairs and Development in the conduct of researches and studies on good governance, food security, nutrition program management and gender and development.

Bidani hopes to collaborate with other UP units through continuous upgrading of Bidani innovative components dealing with the community’s ability to manage information, refinement of the integrative development approach, and promotion of community participation in their own nutrition.

Evolution from model to integrated development approach

Bidani is a community-based, multidisciplinary, holistic, development-oriented approach aimed at improving governance and strengthening the food and nutrition security of Philippine villages. Evolving from the Nutrition Improvement Model (NIM), in 1982, the project changed its acronym to Bidani to live up to its approach. With funding assistance from the Netherlands for 10 years (1990-2000), the project expanded to a program of seven SUCs: Isabela State University (Region II), Central Luzon State University (Region III), Bicol State University (Region V), UP Visayas (Region VI), Visayas State University (formerly Visayas State College of Agriculture) (Region VIII), Central Mindanao State University (Region X), with UPLB as national overall coordinator.

These academic institutions, through their extension programs, partner with local government units to promote nutrition-in-development through community and other key stakeholders’ participation in an integrated management system. As such, Bidani considers nutrition as an objective, a component, an indicator, and outcome of development.

Being non-secular, non-partisan, scientific, and highly committed to their academic and social goals, the SUCs of Bidani have earned the trust of the communities that sustain the program.

Bidani as a program is now in its 38th year, lodged at the Institute of Human Nutrition and Food, College of Human Ecology (IHNF-CHE), UPLB as the national overall coordinator. It has become the academe’s unique and continuing contribution to national development despite changes in the political leadership. It has become a flagship program of UPLB and has received multiple awards and recognitions.

In four decades, Bidani was strengthened through the implementation of innovative components or strategies:

1) Barangay Integrated Development Approach (BIDA) the development strategy for LGUs through a systematic, holistic and bottom-up approach in planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of projects and activities as embodied in a Barangay Integrated Development Plan (BIDP);
2) Participative Nutrition Enhancement Approach (PNEA) through strengthening health and nutrition interventions in the prevention of malnutrition and rehabilitation of malnourished children.
3) Barangay Management Information System (BMIS), which focuses on the needs of the barangay through an efficient and effective data collection prior to program planning, and management and implementation of various projects and activities at the barangay.

Bidanized equals better LGUs

One of the aims of Barangay Integrated Development Approach (BIDA) is to create awareness and to empower people in the local communities to participate actively in the development process. The BIDA as an innovative strategy is a package of capability building activities aimed at developing the capacity of the barangays in developing and managing nutrition-oriented programs. Technical trainings are conducted for project development or formulation of the barangay integrated development plan (BIDP) and implementation.

Trained barangay local government units (BLGUs) ensure that project planning is participatory, multi-sectoral, and uses the bottoms-up approach involving all the local officials and community stakeholders in problems and needs identification, and in identification of possible solutions.

Bidani has made a difference in empowering local government units and other stakeholders in community nutrition development planning. This was attained through relative coordination and complementation of projects, programs and activities among the development functionaries and the intended clientele and enhanced linkages of grassroots, stakeholders and other institutions such as government organization (GOs), non-government organization (NGOs), private agencies, and people’s organizations (POs).

With the adoption and operationalization of the Bidani strategy,

(1) A system in planning has been established in the barangays. Through the system the local officials and community members are able to identify sectoral problems and needs of the community from ocular inspection and surveys. With the availability of updated information, the local officials are able to come up with programs, projects and activities (PPAs) in the Barangay Integrated Development Plans (BIDPs) that are appropriate to the needs of their constituents.

LGUs which are “Bidanized” are able to effectively and efficiently evaluate and manage their own resources and needs, and access national and higher level programs of government and non-government organizations providing much needed assistance relevant to their situation.

(2) The expanded Barangay Development Councils/Program Planning and Implementing Committees (BDCs/PPICs) has become more organized, active and functional and are able to implement projects and deliver services to their constituents. Moreover, through the strategy, people’s participation in barangay activities has increased.

(3) They are able to monitor the children with malnutrition problems and are able to implement programs responsive to their needs like feeding programs, the establishment of food production areas, and livelihood training. They are able to link with concerned municipal agencies and members of the PPIC to work on projects.

(4) Bidani catchment barangays have been recognized as model barangays. They have received awards and have become favorite training grounds, locally, nationally and internationally.

(5) The barangay officials have become computer literate. Having learned how to make powerpoint presentations and other computer applications such as Excel, Word, and Internet (Google search) and enhanced their communication skills.

Pegging success on nutrition

If it is to become the indicator of the program’s success, the nutrition component of Bidani must be highlighted. In its early years of implementation, the nutrition component was weak since Bidani did not offer any direct interventions. Thus, in 1994, the Participative Domiciliary Nutrition Rehabilitation (PDNR) was launched as an individualized and family-focused approach to rehabilitate and/or prevent malnutrition among children 0-36 months of age and to promote improved nutrition.

PDNR reinforced the partnership and joint responsibility of the parents, the community, government line agencies and GOs with technical support from the SUCs. The PDNR also reinforced the nutrition-related activities of the government such as the Comprehensive Health and Nutrition Program of the Department of Health (DOH), the Supplemental Feeding Program of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) and Department of Education (DepEd).

Through this strategy, malnutrition has been reduced in Bidani covered barangays with 17 percent of the 1,387 children (0-36 months) rehabilitated to normal status after six months. Based on data covered by the seven member SUCs from 1996-2000 like CMU, UPV, BU, ISU, CLSU, VSU and UPLB as the National Coordinator, reduction of malnutrition prevalence from the covered villages such that 82 percent or 8 out of 10 children were rehabilitated and/or improved to a higher nutritional classification after 12 months. There was also a significant increase of families involved in food production, mainly backyard gardening and animal husbandry.

Then in 2009, PNEA was conceptualized and implemented for a more comprehensive and participative approach in the delivery of nutrition and health services. It aims to rehabilitate and prevent the occurrence of malnutrition among 0-24 month old children through life cycle approach. Nutrition is crucial in human development and in reaching one’s potential. A compromised nutritional status even at the age of conception has a bearing on an individual’s nutritional status later in life.

PNEA offers an integrated nutrition enhancement package to ensure that LGUs and other partners would be able to deliver nutrition services effectively to achieve a healthy and well-nourished community. The approach provides technical assistance in facilitating the implementation of the national nutrition program at the local level and strengthening the skills of health providers (MHO, MNAO, BNS, BHW, midwives, peers, etc.) on health and nutrition development activities. PNEA also encourages participation of local stakeholders in health and nutrition activities.

The promotion and utilization of Kalinga mix (adopted from the Food and Nutrition Research Institute as Insumix) as the main food-based supplementary feeding is one of the main nutrition interventions of this strategy. Kalinga is a low cost, flour-like mixture of rice, mungbean and sesame seed. It is high in energy, protein and carbohydrates needed for optimum body growth and constant supply of energy for children to sustain their daily activities.

The information premium and Bidani’s niche

Literature on the subject report that different agencies have initiated and established local information systems. The Bidani Barangay Management Information System (BMIS) sets itself apart by helping the community establish its own sustainable databanking system to generate updated and reliable information for evidence-based planning, monitoring and evaluation of development activities at the barangay and municipal levels.

The BMIS and Municipal Management Information System (MMIS), which is the consolidation of all the BMIS of the municipality, are electronic systems which help synergize barangay and municipal development goals and activities.

Through the BMIS and MMIS electronic systems, the LGUs can also generate information for: the administrative reports requested by different agencies such as the local governance performance management system (LGPMS); situational analysis in the preparation of municipal/city development plans (CDPs) such as comprehensive land use plans (CLUPs); providing basis for the barangay development plan or financial plan; facilitating delivery of services to target beneficiaries; and monitoring and evaluation of projects.

The BMIS survey form is a two-page questionnaire which can generate about 100 tables and reports on the socio-demographic, economic, agriculture, health and nutrition information of the family and its members. Some of the statistical reports generated are population, working age groups, income and poverty levels, school enrolment rates, civil statuses, religious membership, sources of income, overseas Filipino workers population, and PWD population. Data also include nutritional statuses of 0-6-year olds, and statuses of immunization, deworming, vitamin and micronutrient supplementation, and breastfeeding of 0-24 month old children. Causes of mortality and morbidity, family planning practices, access to sanitary toilet, potable water, garbage disposal practices, engagement in food production activities are indicated. The BMIS/MMIS electronic systems can also generate a list of families or members needing assistance, such as those out of school. A unique feature of the BMIS is the integration and prioritization of nutrition data in the system. It relates nutritional status to the social, economic and environmental problem of a specific child.

The BMIS builds the capacity of the barangay to conduct a proper survey. Each step is designed to be sustainable, participatory, and specific for barangay council members so that they will have a sense of ownership of the activity. It is characterized by simple, user-friendly design flexible enough to accommodate any necessary modification.
Of the more than 1,024 barangays trained on BMIS, about 70 percent are continuing their BMIS.

On the road toward greater reach and relevance

To date, the Bidani Network Program is continuing as a member of the Inter-agency Technical Committee of the National Nutrition Council. The achievements of Bidani are contributory to the attainment of the goals of the Philippine Development Plan and the Philippine Plan of Action for Nutrition.

Other major notable achievements in nutrition of the Bidani Network Program from 1978 to 2007 are the following:"

Farmer-Scientist Davide
Restoring Dignity of Farmers

At 82 years old, a person such as Romulo Davide already has a lot of feathers in his cap. He is a University of the Philippines Los Baños Professor Emeritus, and a recipient of the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 2012 for his Farmer-Scientists Training Program (FSTP) to which more than anything else, he is the enduring light to many farmers all over the country. In an interview with UP Forum, Davide shares how his award-winning project known as the Farmer-Scientists Training Program (FSTP) speaks of his life in a continuum.

Just a kid from Argao

His roomful of documents piled up on his desk and floor, jars containing various plant specimens, and of course, the pictures hanging on his office walls on the different times of his life tell of his very productive, yet humble life.

He points to a picture in black and white hanging on a wall close to the door of his office. He tells about how a young Davide in white polo shirt and trousers, bare foot along with his school mates at the public school grounds in Barangay Colawin, Argao, Cebu, dreamed of not just finishing school, but also going back armed with the knowledge of improving farming in his hometown.

It takes a young Davide who was early on exposed to the hardship of tilling the land as his family makes a living through farming to have such a dream to further improve agriculture by means of science and technology through what he calls “the secret weapon” that is education.

Taking it from the words of his father who was a teacher at his hometown’s public school, “there is no barren land, only barren minds,” Davide continued and pursued his studies to become the farmer-scientist that he is today.

As a scientist

Dr. Davide had to cope with the pressure of school and work, but managed to obtain his BS Agriculture degree in 1957 from the College of Agriculture in UP Los Baños. Shortly after, he pursued a M.Sc. in Plant Pathology at Oklahoma State University which was followed by a PhD in Nematology-Plant Pathology from the North Carolina State University.

“Being a scientist and professor of Plant Pathology and Nematology at the Plant Pathology Department, College of Agriculture, UPLB, I started teaching and research work in the laboratory. I did research, mainly to identify plant diseases caused by nematodes, those microscopic pests that attack the root system of fruits, vegetables, root crops and other plants,” he said.

“We spent several years doing studies on the biological control of plant parasitic nematodes until we discovered a soil fungus, Paecilomyceslilacinus that feeds on the eggs, larvae, and adult nematode body and eventually kills the nematode,” he continued.

After working on this study with the help of his students and research assistants, Dr. Davide was able to develop the Biocon technology for the biological control of nematodes that attack the roots of many crops like rice, corn, banana, citrus, vegetables and others. According to Davide, Biocon is now registered and patented as Bioact. Its most significant contribution is that “it is harmless to man and animals compared to highly toxic and costly imported chemical nematicides,” he empashized. Bioact is now manufactured in Germany with markets in Europe, South America, USA and other countries worldwide.

As an Agriculture Extension Worker

The “Father of Plant Nematology” shared how he led in developing FSTP,which was part of the lecture series of the Ramon Magsasay Award Foundation. This award is the Asian equivalent of the Nobel peace prize.

“Lacking in scientific farming technology, the farmers only produce low yields and therefore insufficient for their families. Thus, they remain poor and hungry and peace and order is a perennial problem. This was basically the situation in Cebu where we started our extension work in 1994,”Davide said.

“In response to this scenario and to address the poverty and hunger problem of our poor farmers, especially those in the upland mountainous communities, I conceived a program that was specifically designed to liberate the poor farmers from the bondage of poverty and hunger and is based on the assumption that farming is business. The farmers will not only grow corn but also staple crops like sweet potato, cassava, vegetables, fruit crops and other crops of commercial value and integrate them with backyard animal production.

“Farmers are Scientists through FSTP. The Corn-based Farmer-scientists Research, Development and Extension (RDE) Program for Sustainable Agricultural Development (FSTP) is based on the premise that farmers are smart individuals who by themselves can become scientists who implement and design experiments to arrive at useful conclusions with the guidance of scientists.”

The Cebuano scientist was also awarded the 1994 Gawad Saka Outstanding Agricultural Scientist Award from the Department of Agriculture that included a PHP 500,000 research grant along with the Jose Rizal Pro Patria Gold Medal from then Philippine President Fidel V. Ramos. He said that he was “greatly challenged to help poor farmers so that they can live in peace and prosperity.”

“They have no right to remain poor and so the FSTP program was implemented initially with the PHP 500,000 research grant in cooperation with the local and regional government agencies like the DA-RFU 7, DOST 7, Dep Ed 7, Argao LGUs and NGOs,” he added.

DOST Region 7 Director Edilberto L. Paradela (front) and Dr. Davide inspect fruits and plants of ampalaya grown by Farmer Scientists Ernemel and Lorena Soco at the back of the DOST-7 building.

As the FSTP project leader

He further explains, “Under the FSTP program, farmers have to undertake three phases, namely: Phase I: farmers do research with the scientists in the field and also learn the value of love of God, country and people. They design and conduct experiments that include land preparation, varietal and fertilizer trials, intercropping, among others, which is the initial and technical part of FSTP for the farmers to become farmer-scientists.”

Meanwhile, Phase II means “farmers adopt the scientific methods and technologies learned in Phase I into their own farms, such as the use of new high-yielding varieties of corn, sweet potato and vegetables, correct use and application of fertilizer, correct preparation and care of soil.”

UP creates NOAH Center
April 3, 2017 by UP Media and Public Relations Office

The University of the Philippines UP, by virtue of the  approval of the Board of Regents on Feb. 23 and an Executive Order from UP Pres. Danilo L. Concepcion, established the NOAH Center (Nationwide Operational Assessment of Hazards – NOAH Center for climate actions and disaster risk reduction management) in UP on March 21."
The ‘Panday’ Conspiracy – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/the-panday-conspiracy/,"


It all began last week with my fellow chancellors at UP. With the term of the current president, Alfredo E. Pascual, coming to an end in February, the chancellors began to “plot” not a coup but a very special tribute timed for our Presidential’s Advisory Council meeting on Jan. 17, 2017.

The idea was to present one of those trophy-like awards, with the citation assigned for writing to an Inquirer columnist. We agreed to exchange ideas—by e-mail because the chancellors are located all over the country—on what would go into the citation, based on our own experiences of working with the president, while the trophy would be designed in Cebu.

I thought about the planned trophy and mentioned my reservations. I’ve seen too many of these awards gathering dust in dusty corners of the house or office. I’ve even seen some being sold in second-hand shops. In SM Megamall one weekend, I stopped dead in my tracks once when I passed by such a shop where a trophy with UP’s iconic Oblation (“lalakeng hubad” or naked man to many taxi drivers) was selling for P40,000.

The president deserves something better, I said, something he will keep and treasure. I thought of Toym Imao, whose public artworks—always with social messages—have become a familiar site in UP Diliman. He has also come to be known for his light installations, and I mean light as ilaw like the grand ones we had over the Christmas holidays, emanating from the Oblation and around the campus oval.

The other chancellors liked the idea, but we were starting from scratch. What could Toym put in the trophy, which I thought would be at most a foot high?

This would have to depend now on the proposed text or citation. I had asked the other chancellors to send me their thoughts. They did so dutifully, keeping a subject heading that warned: “Secret! Not to be forwarded!”

‘Padayon’!

Meanwhile I was playing with the word padayon, which is found in all our Visayan languages. A favorite word with the president who uses it mainly to mean “Onwards!” which in Tagalog and other local languages means “Sulong.”

In addition, though, as I described in a column last year, padayon also means working together such as two people carrying something together, or even an entire team. Padayon is tied very much to the notion of movement, of taking a journey together, the “dayon” close in its meanings to “dayo.”

I e-mailed my thoughts to Toym, to get him started with the artwork. He liked the padayon theme.

Meanwhile my fellow conspirators were still sending in their experiences and what struck me, especially from our younger constituent universities, was how the president had encouraged them to explore new programs. It was the president, too, who guided UP Cebu, which had barely survived a serious crisis, to stand up again and move forward. From a campus of UP Visayas, it had become an autonomous college and, just recently, a separate constituent university.

Padayon, I thought, and then, one day, panday popped up in my head. Our brain circuits are amazing, sometimes going into dormancy only to light up with the right connections. I am sure one circuit was linguistic, tuning into the alliteration of panday and padayon.

But I am sure panday came to my mind, too, because I had been handling medical anthropology classes with discussions of amulets and talismans or anting-anting. One of my students had submitted a term paper around the theme of traditional healers who use metal objects. Fortuitously, she called right before the Christmas break, asking for a consultation before heading off for home in Mindanao, where she hoped to look into metals and metalwork."
"Chinese embassy scholars, profs experience China winter camp – University of the Philippines",https://up.edu.ph/chinese-embassy-scholars-profs-experience-china-winter-camp/,"


Select students and professors from three Philippine universities participated in the one-week in-depth Winter Camp in China hosted by the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China to the Philippines.

“We aim to promote understanding and collaboration among people,” said China Education Association for International Exchange’s (CEAIE) representative Shen Xuesong during the welcoming banquet for the Filipino delegates.

This is also the goal of the said camp participated by 18 students and three professors from the University of the Philippines, Diliman (UPD), Bicol University (BU) and Philippine Normal University (PNU).

The camp, which featured the encounters with fellow students and teachers from top Chinese universities from Dec. 7 to 14, is an initiative by Chinese Ambassador Zhao Jianhua in partnership with the CEAIE and the Chinese Ministry of Education.

“I am confident that this would be a great opportunity to further enhance our amicable ties,” Jianhua said in the invitation.

The delegates spent the week in Beijing and Xi’an discovering and appreciating Chinese culture and heritage while meeting students from esteemed universities in China. Zhang “Leo” Shangwu, attaché of the Chinese embassy accompanied the delegation.

Among the partner universities, which welcomed and gave orientation to the delegates were Peking University, Beijing Normal University, Xi’an Jiaotong University, and Xi’an International Studies University. Their international offices toured the students and professors in their respective campuses.

The all-expense-paid trip was a great opportunity to know the real China, BU’s team leader and Dean of Office of Students Services, Dr. Merlie Arbo said.

“There’s nothing wrong if we have diplomatic ties with them. But that doesn’t mean that we have to stop to standing for our rights. Although we have issues, the only remedy is for us to talk,” Arbo said. She added that BU looks forward to the Chinese embassy offering scholarships to its students and providing them a chance to participate in similar initiatives. Only UP and BU students enjoy the Chinese ambassador’s scholarship program to date.

The camp also included tours to historical scenic spots in Beijing such as the China Science and Technology Museum, Beijing National Stadium, the National Aquatics Centre, the Summer Palace, Beijing Planning Exhibition Hall, the Tian’anmen Square, the Forbidden City and the Great Wall. The participants were also treated to a Peking Opera in Beijing.

"Health, Wellness, and Heritage : Did you know? – University of the Philippines",https://up.edu.ph/health-wellness-and-heritage-did-you-know/,"


There are physical activity prescriptions for different age groups in the Philippines.

The Department of Health (DOH) published the Philippine National Guidelines on Physical Activity (PNGPA) in 2010. The PNGPA was formulated by experts from the World Health Organization, DOH, UP Diliman College of Human Kinetics, and Strength and Conditioning, Inc. It was benchmarked against existing guidelines from other countries then modified to suit local situations and settings.

For the majority, the increasing prevalence of a sedentary lifestyle poses many major health risks, while “for a very small minority, physical or sporting activity may be life threatening,” said the DOH. The PNGPA was developed with those considerations in mind. Apart from suggestions for achieving physical health, the PNGPA also addresses the needs of Filipinos aiming for physical fitness or “physical capabilities beyond health.”

According to the DOH, the PNGPA provides simple rules that will allow individuals to pursue a physically-active lifestyle. Its promotion and adoption, however, “should also be encouraged at an institutional level.

The implementing guidelines of the PNGPA are meant for people at the forefront of promoting and implementing the program: health professionals; fitness trainers; barangay health workers; physical education, health, and sports coordinators and teachers; and human resource department officers in the workplace.

The ten guidelines

An evaluation of physical activity readiness must be made before engaging in any physical activity and clearance from a physician is recommended if you want to engage in more rigorous physical activity;
To ensure safety, clearance from a physician is also needed for people with illnesses that may contraindicate exercise;
If deemed healthy, exercise should progress slowly and within comfortable effort levels—overexertion is not recommended;
Stop if dizziness, nausea, shortness of breath, and chest pains occur;
Reduce the intensity of the exercise or stop totally if there are physical or verbal manifestations of severe fatigue, cramps, and joint and muscle pains;
Keep a daily record of physical activity for monitoring;
For implementing personnel, allow the participant to stop when he requests at any point to do so;
Drink 250 ml of fluid every 15 to 20 minutes of activity to ensure proper hydration;
Wear proper attire and footwear for thermal stress management and prevention of injuries; and
Allow ample recovery time after physical activities.

The prescribed activities

Children aged five to 12 years old should get at least 60 minutes of daily physical activity. It could be any one or a combination of the following:

Active daily tasks such as active travel (walking, cycling, stair climbing) and household and school chores;
Programmed physical activities such as exercise, dance, or sports; and
Unstructured spontaneous play or high impact play such as running, jumping, skipping, and other movements involved in children’s games or playground activities such as those on bars and ropes.

Adolescents to young adults aged 13 to 20 years old should also get at least 60 minutes of daily physical activity. It could be any one or a combination of the following:

Active daily tasks similar to those mentioned previously;
At least 40 minutes of programmed physical activities and for those who have fitness goals, a minimum of 20 to 30 minutes of continuous movement three to five times a week;
At least 20 minutes of sustained moderate to vigorous physical activities resulting in rapid breathing like brisk walking, jogging, indigenous games, and dancing; and
Two to three times a week of muscle strengthening and flexibility activities which involve weight or load bearing exercises that build muscle and bone strength, and flexibility.

Adults aged 21 to 45 years old should get between 30 to 60 minutes of daily physical activity through the following:

Active daily tasks such as active travel and household chores;
Moderate aerobic activity done continuously for a minimum of 30 minutes or in increments of 10 minutes or longer resulting in a noticeable increase in heart rate and breathing, or for fitness purposes, 20 to 30 minutes of continuous activity at least three days per week, or for more active people with no risk factors, vigorous aerobic activity resulting in fast breathing and substantial increase in heart rate done at least three times a week with the goal of being able to do it five to six times per week;
Activities using all major muscles to increase strength and endurance like weight training, weight bearing calisthenics, or stair climbing at least twice per week but on non-consecutive days, using a light load for a set of ten to 15 repetitions resulting in momentary muscle fatigue and performing at least four times a week, gentle stretches to the point of tension after aerobic exercises or at cool down, giving at least 20 seconds per position per muscle group; and
Two minutes of physical activity for every hour of sitting in the workplace.

Older adults aged 46 to 59 years old should get at least 30 minutes of daily physical activity through the following:

Active daily tasks for adults;
Moderate aerobic activity and prescription for more active people with no risk factors similar to those prescribed for adults;
Activities using all major muscles to increase strength and endurance as well as gentle stretches similar to those prescribed for adults, with the only difference being the set of eight to 12 repetitions;"

Eva Estrada Kalaw (1920-2017) – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/eva-estrada-kalaw-1920-2017/,"


Last week, former senator Eva Estrada Kalaw passed away at the age of 96.  She was a leading political opposition leader during the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos.

Eva Estrada was among the few female students of the Commonwealth era who dared enroll in the University of the Philippines, which was then based in Manila.  Her enrollment in UP was a daring feat because back then, Catholic high schools for girls discouraged their graduates from enrolling in UP on the mistaken assumption that UP is a godless institution.

Eva Estrada took education.  Because she stood out among her classmates, and because she was a headturner, Eva Estrada quickly became a campus figure.

She was a member of the Sigma Delta Phi, an exclusive sorority and the counterpart of the equally exclusive Upsilon Sigma Phi fraternity.

Many UP students were smitten by Eva Estrada, including the statuesque Enrique M. Fernando, the smartest law student in UP.  Although Fernando was unable to win Eva Estrada’s heart, he graduated at the top of his class, and became Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in 1979.

It was another UP student, Teodoro Kalaw, Jr., who won Eva Estrada.  Kalaw, Jr. was an Upsilonian and his family was wealthy and noted for intellectuals like his father, the famous newsman Teodoro M. Kalaw, and the outspoken UP dean Maximo Kalaw.

They made an ideal couple.  Eva Estrada Kalaw was the vocal, outgoing and dynamic type of woman.  Teodoro Kalaw was a mild-mannered businessman who preferred a quiet, private life.

After the war, Teodoro Kalaw put up several successful enterprises, while Eva Estrada Kalaw became noted for civic and humanitarian causes.

In time, Eva Estrada Kalaw developed an interest in politics, and joined the Nacionalista Party.  With the unwavering support of her husband, Eva was elected to the Senate in 1965—the same year Ferdinand Marcos of the NP won the presidency.

Despite her partisan political affiliation with President Marcos, Senator Kalaw opposed measures espoused by NP senators known to be loyal supporters of the president.  Soon, Kalaw became very critical of the Marcos administration both in and outside the Senate.

LONDON – Carmen Legarda, a British-Filipino who hails from Sampaloc in Manila, has made political history in the United Kingdom after becoming the first ever Filipino woman to be selected to run as a Member of Parliament in the upcoming general elections on June 8.

Representing The Green Party of England and Wales, Legarda is standing in the Hendon Constituency, in the London Borough of Barnet, which includes residents living in Burnt Oak, Colindale, Edgware, Hale, Mill Hill, Hendon Central and West Hendon.

The Green Party of England and Wales, colloquially known as the Greens, combines left-wing economic policies with environmentalism and progressive approaches to social policies including human and animal rights, LGBT rights, national living wages and democratic participation.

A colourful upbringing

The youngest of four sisters, Carmen Legarda was born in Sampaloc to Carmita Fernandez Legarda, the first ever Filipina woman to graduate from Oxford University, and actor Juan Antonio “Tony” Carrion, known for movies such as “American Ninja” and “Jose Rizal.”

At a young age, most of Legarda’s immediate family relocated to Oxford, England. Legarda later moved back to Manila during her high school years, going on to study psychology at the University of the Philippines in Diliman and Medicine at University of the East (Ramon Magsaysay).

Politics, however, has always been part of her heritage.

Her great grandfather, Benito Legarda, was a Filipino legislator who held various positions as cabinet member and vice president of the first Philippine legislature, before later becoming Philippine Resident Commissioner to the United States Congress.

Legarda’s grandmother, Trinidad Fernandez Legarda, was a suffragette, civic leader and diplomat – and was the first woman ambassador from the Philippines, appointed in 1958 to Vietnam.

Legarda’s eldest sister, Atty. Katrina Legarda, is a well-known lawyer, respected law professor and advocate for women and children’s rights in the Philippines.

In 1997 Atty. Legarda famously won a child rape case against Romeo Jalosjos, a former Congressman, who was sentenced to prison for life (but later released by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo after 13 years).

Advocating equality

Human rights have always been a primary driver for Legarda, both professionally and in her personal life.

Although a fully qualified doctor, Legarda’s career has been in the field of Human Resources and People Management.

Over the past three decades, Legarda has worked for renowned international organisations including The British Council, Save the Children and the Methodist Church, and has delivered workshops and training on equal opportunities and diversity to senior management worldwide.

“I believe all human beings are equal,” Legarda wrote in her campaign statement. “As a woman, as a British citizen, as an ethnic person of Spanish-Filipino heritage, and as a Human Resources consultant who has worked in over 30 countries, I’ve experienced first-hand how our society labels and segregates, rather than unites.”

“I’ve chosen to run for MP because I have demonstrated leadership at a senior level throughout my career, and I am confident that I can deliver fair, able leadership on a national scale.”

Tackling issues of social justice

The UK currently operates under a Conservative government led by Prime Minister Theresa May.

Legarda says she joined The Green Party because its values stand out in striking contrast to the disillusionment, deception, injustice, and exclusion that has so far occurred under the Conservatives.

“The Green Party is a party that cares, truly cares, about the wellbeing of ordinary people in our society. We tackle social issues that matter and are deeply committed to achieving social justice.”"

Malang: Painter charmed with imaginative use of color – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/malang-painter-charmed-with-imaginative-use-of-color/,"


Malang, a leader of the second generation of modernists that rejuvenated Philippine painting in the post-Pacific War period, died at his home in Quezon City on June 10, just short of 90.

Born Mauro Malang Santos in Manila’s Sta. Cruz district on January 1928, he used his maternal surname—that of a pre-Spanish clan in San Miguel de Mayumo, Bulacan province—for his artistic signature.

Malang’s contemporaries include Arturo Rogerio Luz, Ang Kiukok, Hugo Yonzon, Juvenal Sanso, Federico Aguilar Alcuaz, Roberto Rodriguez Chabet and Romulo Olazo.

Largely self-taught, Malang was noted for his imaginative use of color.

He took no formal art lessons beyond those given by a retired art professor in his neighborhood and half a semester’s classes at the University of the Philippines College of Fine Arts.

After a few months of drawing comics strips for the Roces chain, he moved to Manila Chronicle in 1947."

First Aeta UP grad vows to serve Pinatubo tribes – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/first-aeta-up-grad-vows-to-serve-pinatubo-tribes/,"


CLARK FREEPORT — It’s not too difficult to find Norman King in Barangay Macapagal, a settlement put up by former first lady Imelda Marcos on a hill at the northern side of this former United States military base-turned-economic zone.

Pointing to the King family home, an “unat” (lowlander) running a tricycle repair shop nearby described King as “the ‘kulot’ (Aeta) who recently graduated from UP (the University of the Philippines).”

It’s a distinction that the Aeta community around Mt. Pinatubo wears with pride. No other Aeta has been known to have graduated from the state university before King, who obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in behavioral sciences at UP Manila last month.

King, 27, is as proud of his identity, describing himself as a “katutubong” (native) Aeta, in an interview at the family kitchen behind a small yard filled with metal boxes, rubber tires and wooden planks.

In fact, during UP Manila’s recognition day on June 20 and graduation on June 21, King wore a “lubay,” an Aeta G-string for which he got such comments as “cool,” “‘astig’ (bold),” and “‘ang lupit mo, kuya’ (that’s gutsy, brother).”

On Gender, Privilege, and Rule of Law

Valedictory Address, UP College of Law Class 2017

June 26, 2017

Carlos S. Hernandez Jr.

Eight years ago, I was working in a pharmaceutical plant in Laguna for 12 hours a day, from Monday to Saturday. It was a 12-hour shift, six days a week, in the middle of the production line. I was a chemical engineer. I loved my job then but my childhood dream of becoming a lawyer continued to haunt me while I supervised the production of drugs.

Attending law school after work from Laguna was impossible.  It was only when I was able to find a job in Makati that finally I looked up the evening sky and saw that the stars had aligned to make my childhood dream of becoming a lawyer closer to reality. The LAE was the only entrance exam I took, not so much because I adore UP Law but because UP Law was the only law school I could afford. I was a working student, and I attended classes at night. I would report to work at 7AM so that I could leave at 4 PM and avoid the MRT rush hour on the way to school. The MRT becomes a war zone during rush hour. I would read my cases while standing inside the moving train, in a jampacked, canned-sardines scenario where I was sandwiched between fellow passengers. Reading cases was an act of bravery, and sometimes I was not that brave enough.

I would also read inside jeepneys, unmindful of the heat and traffic congestion around me. Learning the law in solitude while commuting became a ritual. It became my sweet escape.

My mother, on various occasions, asked me to quit my job and offered to finance my education. I would only look at her and say nothing because I know that she would be borrowing money again just to send me to school. The love of a mother is pure.

My story is similar to the stories of many of my classmates in the evening block. Their stories, though, are far more inspirational. A blockmate who is also graduating today is a breadwinner who had to send his three younger siblings to school with his meager salary. A blockmate has to put her baby to sleep after class. Another blockmate still has to work after class for his graveyard shift in a BPO. The road we had to take to arrive at this moment of so much joy and great pride was paved with sweat, tears, but most of all, love.

Our stories are a testament to the truth that the doors of the UP College of Law will be opened to those who are brave enough to knock, and stubborn enough to knock repeatedly and persistently.

This is not to say that sheer determination alone is enough to reach one’s dreams. I do not want to contribute to the spread of the big lie that poverty is not a hindrance to success. It is. Poverty IS a hindrance to success.

Five years in law school was both a humbling and rewarding experience. The experience made my resolve stronger to fight for the things that are worth fighting for. Allow me at this point to share my thoughts on three issues that are close to my heart. These are gender, privilege, and most importantly, rule of law.

ON GENDER

At first I thought law school would be an ultraconservative enclave. I once feared that students like me who are members of the LGBT community would have to suppress our gender identity and expression so that we would not attract too much attention to ourselves. I even practiced introducing myself to my professors and classmates in an alpha male voice, which is, of course, not my real voice. I practiced saying “I AM CARLOS HERNANDEZ JR.” in front of a mirror several times.

I was wrong. Because the moment Prof. Gaby Concepcion entered the room for my first class in law school, I knew right then and there that I belong, that I did not have to use a different voice to introduce myself to her and to my classmates. In my fifth year in law school, together with my LGBTQ+ friends in Malcolm Hall, we founded the UP OUTLaws, an organization of law students who self-identify as lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and transgenders, and many more.

We also found an unlikely rainbow ally in Dean Pacifico Agabin. Dean Agabin is of the view that “to bar the lesbians, the gays and the transsexuals from the civil right to marry would violate the guarantee of equal protection,” and that the concept of marriage under the Family Code as a contract between a man and a woman is obsolete.

I fear that there are those who still think that a lawyer is less effective or less credible simply because he is gay or is flamboyant. That is why I think gay lawyers suppress their gender for professional reasons. I am confident that the members of the UP Law Class of 2017 would not entertain any such homophobic notion. One of the reasons why I studied so hard is because I want my competence to be measured based on merit alone, and that my gender would not get in the way of me getting retained, hired, promoted, or even appointed.

It’s about time that we extend the equal protection of the laws to the people who do not fit into the oppressive gender and sexual binary by passing the Anti-Discrimination Bill, and by making the institution of marriage accessible to everyone, and I mean everyone.

ON PRIVILEGE

There are two aspects of privilege that I would like to highlight about being a UP graduate and a UP Law graduate in particular.

First, our UP Law education gives us a certain level of credibility whether we deserve it or not. This is a double-edged sword. We can use it to educate or to ridicule. The rampant smart-shaming against UP students may have its roots in the tendency of some of us to mock. Maybe we have been using ridicule as a tool of persuasion very often, even at times when the circumstances do not warrant its use. We have been mocking the uninformed and the ignorant as if the quality of the opinions they form and things they believe in are ultimately of their own doing alone, without taking into account that they might not have been exposed to the kind of education we have been exposed to because of circumstances beyond their control such as abject poverty.

Of course, fake news, attempts to revise history, and malicious propaganda being propagated by self-serving individuals must be dealt with, with the full force of what we know and what we believe in. Now more than ever, we need to win the war against untruth, and the battle against memory.

Second, the culture of pervasive “othering” has to stop. I am referring to our tendency to label people who are not from UP as “The Others” with all the derogatory and pejorative connotations we attach to the label. It is harsh to even joke about one’s competence based on the school one has attended. It is a subtle way of speaking highly of oneself by reducing another’s worth.

We raised our voices so that the muted cries coming from the graves of the victims of Martial Law would be heard when Marcos was buried in Libingan Ng Mga Bayani. We protested against the death penalty because it is a cruel and inhuman punishment and the usual victims of wrongful convictions are the poor. We are also the first to express our indignation against the disregard of due process in this administration’s war against drugs. Let us be hated for these reasons, which are principled reasons, and not because we are seen as boastful of the education that we received.

The thing about privilege is that it’s like air: we’re oblivious of its existence yet it’s always there.

ON RULE OF LAW

The rule of law is the raison d’être of the legal profession. It is pointless for all of us here to master the law if we could not even invoke it. We assume that everyone should appreciate and cherish the due process of law.

But we are wrong. We are wrong to assume that we share the same faith in and devotion to the rule of law with the rest of the public. Law or due process is now seen by many as an unnecessary bureaucracy, an inconvenience, or worse, a tool for the dangerous elements of our society to go unpunished and roam free. We are suddenly awakened that our shared belief that the rule of law is beneficial to all is in reality abhorred and despised by many."

Legal experts weigh in on religious freedom in the secular state – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/legal-experts-weigh-in-on-religious-freedom-in-the-secular-state/,"


The UP Law Center headed a forum to help the Philippine legal system grapple with the mandates of both religious freedom and state secularization amid religious pluralism in the country. The forum was held on August 3, 2017 at Malcom Hall, UP Diliman.

The organizers flew in expertise from the Brigham Young University J. Reuben Clark Law School International Center for Law and Religion Studies (BYU-JRCLS-ICLRC), Valparaiso University Law School (VALS), and the International Criminal Court (ICC) to provide world perspectives on the issue. Experts based in the Philippines discussed the local situation and jurisprudence.

The keynote speakers were: W. Cole Durham, founding director of the ICLRC, who discussed American and European responses to the “erosion” of the right to freedom of religion; Prof. Zachary Calo, research scholar in law and religion of VALS, who did a philosophical take on the issue citing a Vatican proposal for church participation in state affairs; and, ICC Judge Raul Pangalangan, who talked about “laicite and religiosity in the Philippine public sphere.” For the closing message, Justice Marvic Leonen gave his dissent over “benevolent neutrality” and jurisprudence which would uphold the dominance of one religion.

Special Sessions

Durham and Calo were also resource speakers on a special session on trends in US Supreme Court law on religious freedom. Dean Jose Manuel Diokno of the De La Salle University College of Law discussed Philippine constitutional provisions on religion vis-a-vis universal human rights. Prof. Florin Hilbay of the UP College of Law talked about constitutionalism and mimicry on religious freedoms and rights.

Director Patricia Salvador-Daway of the UP Institute for the Administration of Justice gave a presentation on freedom of religion at the workplace. Dean Serafin Cuevas Jr. of the New Era University College of Law discussed collision and interface between law and religion. Dean Ma. Soledad Deriquito-Mawis of the Lyceum of the Philippines College of Law talked mainly of the oft-cited Escritor vs. Estrada case.

Three reactors were assigned for each special session. They were: Leo Battad, Rowena Daroy-Morales, and Ryan Oliva from the UP College of Law; Nielson Pangan and Lorna Patajo-Kapunan from Far Eastern University; Jemy Benigno Gatdula from the University of Asia and the Pacific School of Law and Governance; Jaime Hofileña from the Ateneo de Manila University; and, Benedicto Ernesto Bitonio from the UP School of Labor and Industrial Relations.

Reactors also included: former Commissioners Nasser Marhomsalic and Liwayway Vinzons-Chato, of Human Rights and Internal Revenue, respectively; Fina Bernadette dela Cuesta-Tantuico of the Philippine Bar Association, and Regal Oliva of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines; Jo Aurea Imbong of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines, and Alvaro Senturias Jr. of the United Church of Christ in the Philippines; Marie Curie Fellow on Sustainable Peace Building, Jenny Lind Elmaco and President Henry Rojas of Lawyers Beyond Borders; Laguna RTC Judge Divinagracia Bustos Ongkeko, and legal adviser Rafael Aquino.

Compassion, Our Common Ground: The Investiture Speech of Danilo L. Concepción
September 20, 2017 by UP Media and Public Relations Office

I stand before you today as a student trained in two disciplines: that of science, which taught me the measure of Nature, and that of the law, which taught me the measure of Man. I cannot claim that I have learned enough because education is a lifelong process, and I expect to live a little longer. But this I have surely come to realize: that while Nature may be bewilderingly complex, Man is infinitely more so.

Danilo Concepcion capped his first UP Diliman Lantern Parade as UP president by hailing the tradition as uniquely UP, reminding the UP constituents to be light sources in their own lives and communities, and announcing the grant of P10,000 cash gift to each UP employee.

“Let us be lanterns in our lives and in our communities–giving life and lighting the way as we face challenges and look for a better future–lanterns that burn bright in mind and heart, far though we wander,” Concepcion said in Filipino at the end of the Lantern Parade program on December 15, 2017, before the fireworks display.

He said the Lantern Parade is a tradition bearing the UP brand, but reflecting the Filipino spirit in the changing designs of the lanterns and in the lively participation of the community.

In announcing the Christmas cash gift, he said his administration had implemented cost-saving measures which saved money from maintenance and other operating expenses enough to give P10,000 to each employee as a Christmas gift in his first year as President.

Concepcion said he hoped to add to the amount before the end of 2018.

(e) Prima Facie Determination of Sexual Harassment. – Upon receipt of the response to the report or the expiration of the period for the submission thereof, whichever comes first, all pertinent documents shall be forwarded to the ASH Council for evaluation and determination whether or not a prima facie case for sexual harassment exists, and if there is basis for issuance of preventive suspension.

Sexual harassment is deemed to exist on the basis of the complaint when any of the following circumstances is alleged:

1. The sexual favor is demanded or requested as a condition in hiring, employment or reemployment or in granting favorable compensation or promotion or any other term, condition or privilege; or the refusal to grant the sexual favor results in limiting, segregating or classifying which would discriminate, diminish or deprive employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect the person who is the object of sexual harassment;

2. It would impair the rights or privileges of the students, teaching and non-teaching personnel under the law, rules or regulations;

3. It would result in an intimidating, hostile or offensive employment or learning environment; it could force the offended party to give in to the unwanted, unwelcome, or uninvited behavior.

4. Committed against a student, trainee or one who is under the care, custody, supervision or advisorship of the offender, or one whose education, training, apprenticeship or tutorship is entrusted to the offender; or,

At any time during this evaluation, the ASH Council may request the attendance of parties to answer questions, inform them of the opportunity to resolve the complaint through an informal procedure, and employ such other measures as it may deem relevant in the evaluation of the complaint. The ASH Council shall ensure the voluntariness and readiness of the parties opting for either the informal or formal procedure.

The ASH Council shall submit to the Chancellor or President, as the case may be, its report and recommendation/s, notwithstanding any withdrawal of the report made by the aggrieved party, within thirty (30) days from receipt of the response to report/complaint.

Guidelines on Promoting Women’s Empowerment and Gender Equality in the University of the Philippines

Approved by the UP Board of Regents on its 1309th Meeting, 22 July 2015

PREAMBLE

WHEREAS, the University of the Philippines, hereinafter referred to as “the University”, upholds the principles of human rights and gender equality;

WHEREAS, the University upholds the 1987 Constitution which explicitly recognizes the role of women in nation building and the fundamental equality before the law of women and men, as well as the Magna Carta of Women (Republic Act No. 9710) and its implementing rules and regulations;

WHEREAS, the University seeks to ensure that the potentials of all persons, specifically those who are marginalized and socially excluded, are fully developed;

WHEREAS, the University condemns all forms of discrimination and violence that are obstacles to the full participation of women in economic, social, cultural, civil and political life of the University and the nation;

THEREFORE, the University commits to provide an intellectual, healthy, gender-friendly environment that promotes gender equality within the premises and jurisdiction of the University and shall adopt gender mainstreaming as a strategy to implement the Magna Carta of Women and strictly implement policies, guidelines, rules and procedures which are gender-responsive, gender-sensitive and culture-sensitive to the dynamics of interaction among all members of the academic community;

NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the powers vested in it, the Board of Regents of the University hereby promulgates the following Gender Guidelines promoting women’s empowerment and gender equality:

RULE I

GENERAL PROVISION

SECTION 1. Title. – This document shall be known and cited as the “Guidelines on Promoting Women’s Empowerment and Gender Equality in the University of the Philippines” or by the short name “U.P. Gender Guidelines.”

Sec. 2. Coverage. – The U.P. Gender Guidelines shall apply to any and all constituent universities, offices and units, existing or as may be established .

RULE II

DEFINITION OF TERMS

Sec. 3. Definition of Terms. – The following terms shall mean:

A. “Affirmative Action”* refers to a special measure undertaken as a policy action to accelerate the attainment of gender equality in all aspects of the University. Affirmative action should not result in unequal or separate standards and must be discontinued when the objectives of equality of opportunity and treatment have been achieved.

B. “Audit of GAD Funds” refers to a comprehensive audit of the University policies, fund programs, projects and activities focusing on the area of gender and development to determine economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of interventions in addressing gender issues in the University.

C. “Constituent University” – The University is composed of its existing Constituent Universities, as follows: University of the Philippines Diliman; University of the Philippines Manila; University of the Philippines Los Baños; University of the Philippines Visayas; University of the Philippines Mindanao; University of the Philippines Baguio; University of the Philippines Open University; and those that may be created in the future.

D. “Culture-sensitive” is the state of knowing that cultural differences as well as similarities exist, without assigning values, i.e. better or worse, right or wrong, to those cultural differences.

E. “Employee” refers to any person who holds an official appointment or designation in any academic or administrative unit of the University and includes any person who is working in the University as casual or contractual personnel and does not have an employee-employer relationship with the University.

F. “Gender” refers to the socially constructed or determined differences between men and women such as roles, attitudes, behaviors and values. The term “gender” is not interchangeable with the term “sex”, which refers exclusively to the biological differences between men and women. They are learned through the socialization process. These differences determine what is considered appropriate for members of each sex. They are context-specific and can be modified. Other variables, such as ethnicity, class, age and ability intersect with gender differences.

G. “Gender and Development (GAD)” refers to the development perspective and process that is participatory and empowering, equitable, sustainable, free from violence, respectful of human rights, and supportive of self-determination and actualization of human potentials. It seeks to achieve gender equality as a fundamental value that should be reflected in development choices; seeks to transform society’s social, economic, and political structures and questions the validity of the gender roles ascribed to women and men; contends that people are active agents of development and not just passive recipients of development assistance; and stresses the need for women and other marginalized sectors to organize themselves and participate in political processes to strengthen their legal rights.

H. “Gender Audit” refers to a form of “social audit” or “quality audit” which determines whether the organization’s internal practices and related support systems for gender mainstreaming are effective, are reinforcing each other and are being followed. This tool or process assists organizations in establishing a baseline, identifying critical gaps and challenges, and recommending ways of addressing them.

I. “Gender-awareness” is the ability to identify problems arising from gender inequality and discrimination, even if these are not evident on the surface and are “hidden,” or are not part of the general and commonly accepted explanation of what and where the problem lies. Gender awareness means a high level of gender conscientization.

J. “Gender Discrimination” refers to any gender-based distinction, exclusion, or restriction, which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment, or exercise by any person, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil, or any other field.

It includes any act or omission, including by policy, administrative measure, or practice, that directly or indirectly excludes or restricts anyone, on the basis of gender identity, sex or sexual orientation in the recognition and promotion of their rights and their access to and enjoyment of opportunities, benefits, or privileges.

Provided, that a measure or practice of general application is gender discrimination if it fails to provide for mechanisms to offset or address sex or gender-based disadvantages or limitations, as a result of which concerned persons are denied or restricted in the recognition and protection of their rights and in their access to and enjoyment of opportunities, benefits, or privileges; or any person is shown to have suffered the greater adverse effects of those measures or practices.

Provided, finally, that discrimination compounded by or intersecting with other grounds, status, or condition, such as ethnicity, age, poverty, or religion shall be considered gender-based discrimination under the U.P. Gender Guidelines.

K. “Gender Equality” refers to the principle asserting the equality of everyone regardless of gender and their right to enjoy equal conditions realizing their full human potentials to contribute to and benefit from the results of development and with the State recognizing that all human beings are free and equal in dignity and rights.

L. “Gender Equity” refers to the policies, instruments, programs, services, and actions that address unequal gender relations in society by providing preferential treatment and affirmative action as appropriate.

M. “Gender-Fair” or “Gender-Neutral” or “Gender-Friendly” refers to policies, rules and regulations that are applicable to gender; having equal impact on all, giving each person equal access to resources and benefits of a development initiative. In language, it refers to gender-inclusive pronouns that neither reveal nor imply the gender or the sex of a person. These policies may or may not result in gender-fair or gender-friendly outcomes.

N. “Gender Mainstreaming” refers to the strategy for making the design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of policies and programs in all social, political, civil, and economic spheres so that every person, regardless of gender, benefits equally and that inequality is not perpetuated. It is the process of assessing the implications of any planned action, including legislation, policies, or programs in all areas and at all levels so that these contribute to achieving gender equity and equality.

O. “Gender-based Violence” refers to an umbrella term for any harmful act that is perpetrated against a person’s will, and that is based on socially ascribed (gender) differences between males and females. While women and girls are the primary victims of gender-based violence because of their subordinate status vis-a-vis men and boys worldwide, men and boys may be victims of violence that is based on socially determined roles, expectations and behaviors linked to ideas about masculinity.
Gender-based Violence may also constitute acts, which impair or nullify the enjoyment of any person of human rights and fundamental freedoms under general international law or under human rights conventions. These rights and freedoms include:

1. The right to life;
2. The right not to be subject to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment;
3. The right to equal protection according to humanitarian norms in time of international or internal armed conflict;
4. The right to liberty and security of person;
5. The right to equal protection under the law;
6. The right to equality in the family;
7. The right to the highest standard attainable of physical and mental health; and,
8. The right to just and favorable conditions of work.

P. “Gender-responsive” refers to giving consistent and systematic attention to the differences between women and men in society with the view to addressing structural constraints to gender equality.

Q. “Gender-responsive Budgeting” refers to government planning, programming and budgeting that contributes to the advancement of gender equality and fulfillment of women’s rights. It entails identifying and reflecting needed interventions to address gender gaps in University policies plans and budgets.

R. “Gender-sensitive” refers to the ability to recognize gender issues and to recognize women’s different perceptions and interests arising from their different social position and gender roles.

S. “Gross monthly compensation” refers to the monthly basic pay plus mandatory allowances fixed by law.

T. “Gynecological disorders” refers to disorders that would require surgical procedures such as, but not limited to, dilatation and curettage and those involving female reproductive organs such as the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, breast, adnexa and pelvic floor, including hysterectomy, ovariectomy and mastectomy.

U. “Marginalization” refers to a condition where a group is excluded from useful and meaningful participation in the political, economic, social, and cultural life of the University.

V. “Marginalized” refers to the basic, disadvantaged, or vulnerable persons or groups in the university. These include, but are not limited to, women in the following sectors and groups:

The first ASEANnale was a powerful mix of scholarship and artistry, bringing together the 2nd International Symposium on ASEAN Studies (ISAS) and the 1st Film and Multimedia Competition and Exhibition from February 28 to March 2 at the Asian Center, UP Diliman. ASEANnale is a combination of “ASEAN” and “bienniale.”

With the overall theme of “Capturing the spirit of ASEAN in the Digital Times” focusing on diaspora, disasters, and democracy, the event was described by Organizing Committee Chair Grace Javier Alfonso as “a multimodal and multi-textual platform” where regional commonalities are brought together and diversity is reflected and respected.

During the opening program, messages were also delivered by UP President Danilo Concepcion, Officer-in-Charge J. Prospero de Vera III of the Commission on Higher Education, and ASEAN Foundation Chair Elaine Tan. Concepcion said that the key to forming the ASEAN identity was interaction among peoples “on all fronts.” De Vera, meanwhile, lauded the organizers for choosing to discuss issues that bound together the citizens of ASEAN countries. And Tan emphasized the importance of connectivity: physical, institutional, and people-to-people linkages.

In her keynote address, Ambassador Elizabeth Buensuceso, permanent representative of the Philippines to ASEAN, revealed that the Philippines ranked among the lowest in awareness of the ASEAN in a 2016 survey. She said it should serve as “a clarion call for us to double or triple our efforts to make ASEAN known.”

Apart from the opening ceremony, the first day also featured, a Directors’ Forum with Baby Ruth Villarama Gutierrez and Nick Deocampo, plenary and parallel sessions on diaspora, and film and multimedia screenings, and the opening of an exhibit. The second day saw discussions on democracy and disasters in plenary and parallel sessions, in addition to continued film and multimedia screenings.

In all, the first ASEANnale had more than ten main speakers, over 40 paper presentations, and around 40 screened films and multimedia works.

The all new University Food Service (UFS) is now serving the whole UP community in Diliman. On March 20, UP officials, faculty, staff and students attended the official opening and launch of UFS’s new logo at its original location in Vinzon’s Hall.

UFS officer-in-charge Mitzi A. Reyes recognized the joint efforts of UP System and Diliman officials in making the rehabilitation possible for UFS under the leadership of UP President Danilo Concepcion and UP Diliman Chancellor Michael Tan.

Pres. Concepcion in his message emphasized that the administration had persisted in providing funds for the renovation not only for UFS, but also for the whole of Vinzon’s Hall. “There is still a lot to be done in this building. Having a budget of PHP 370M this year, we are looking at further improving the Vinzon’s Hall along with the construction of the Student Union building which will serve as the student’s activity center,” he stated.

“I believe that providing good and nutritious food should not be looked at as a profitable business especially for the UFS because it is in our mandate as a University to provide service. It is about time that we think more about providing service as a responsibility of this University and not as a profit-generating business; so the same will be expected in the reconstruction of the UP Shopping Center. We do away with the principle of overpricing food to save up for store rental rates. Instead, we come up with lower rental rates so that serving good yet affordable food is possible,” Concepcion added.

A Special Lecture and Documentary Screening at the University of the Philippines

 

NHK WORLD TV from Japan collaborates with the University of the Philippines to present a special lecture for students of the College of Mass Communication. Following a screening of a documentary detailing the history between the Philippines and Japan after World War Two, students will explore the role investigative journalism plays in uncovering the truth while engaging in lively discussion with a panel of speakers consisting of the documentary’s producers and NHK WORLD journalists.

Quezon City, Manila, Philippines – 21st April 2017, Friday

Several classes from the University of the Philippines’ College of Mass Communication will attend the special lecture, which is also open to all interested students of the university. The 90 minute special lecture will replace their usual class at that timeslot.

Social media will play a part in facilitating the conversation, with students posing responses and questions to panelists via the Twitter hashtag #NHKUP.

Having completed similar screenings in Los Angeles, London, and Paris this year, NHK WORLD is on a mission to share the power of journalism with the world. At the Philippines edition, university students interested in pursuing a career in journalism will have the opportunity to hear firsthand about veteran journalists’ day-to-day experience
as well as learn more about the processes which enable journalists’ search for the truth.

About the Documentary

Title: NHK NEWSLINE FOCUS
Sub-title: Lt. Onoda’s Return: The Untold Story of a Japanese War Straggler

Synopsis: NHK World has a look at the behind-the-scenes negotiations that helped a Japanese soldier return from the Philippines, nearly 30 years after World War Two. Lieutenant Hiroo Onoda received a hero’s welcome upon returning to his homeland in 1974, but with NHK journalists’ thorough research of official documents, the story takes a different turn. The documentary program involving investigative journalism reveals that it was what appears to be a political and diplomatic deal which allowed the Philippines and Japan to draw closer and move on from the past.

About SFA Online

Students from the University of the Philippines (UP) come from all walks of life. Some of them may not be able to afford paying the full tuition and other expenses to complete their academic requirements in the University.

To address this, UP, with the support of individuals, government, and private sector organizations, introduced a number of student financial assistance programs that can help students cover the cost of studying in the University.

At present, these financial assistance programs are administered as separate support programs. But this limited the offering of comprehensive financial assistance. For a number of students, financial assistance should allow students to cover not only enrolment but also their daily needs and other requirements to actively participate in academic and extracurricular programs. A unified application process can facilitate creation of comprehensive financial assistance to ensure all students can afford to study in the University.

UP created the Student Financial Assistance Online (SFA Online) to streamline the processing of applications from students who wish to obtain student financial assistance. The SFA Online is a web-based program that collects applications and allows matching and packaging of different financial assistance offerings. It collects and consolidates data on household income as well as the socio-economic characteristics of the household of students. Scholarships and Student Affairs units UP use these data to allocate slots and create complementing financial assistance programs for University students.

The SFA Online is a platform managed by the UP System Office of Student Financial Assistance (OSFA). For more information, please visit the SFA Online website at https://sfaonline.up.edu.ph/.

The University of the Philippines bade farewell to one of its sons, Edgardo Javier Angara, in necrological rites on May 18 at UP Diliman. It was the last stop of the 16th Senate President’s remains before he was laid to rest in his hometown of Baler, Aurora on May 22.

Before becoming “SEJA” at the Philippine Senate, where he served from 1987 to 1998 and from 2001 to 2013, Angara was the 15th president of the University from 1981 to 1987. He received his Bachelor of Laws degree from the UP College of Law in 1958.

Arrival honors

The welcome ceremony began at Quezon Hall, the administration building, where Angara held office as president. The UP community led by President Danilo Concepcion received and gave its condolences to the Angara family. A floral wreath was also offered when Angara’s casket was placed in the lobby.

A procession was then held around Quezon Hall and the Academic Oval before proceeding to Malcolm Hall, the UP College of Law building, where the second part of UP’s tribute to Angara continued. The Carillon played the University Hymn, “UP Naming Mahal,” from the time his casket was at the Quezon Hall lobby until it reached the College. (Arlyn VCD Romualdo, UP MPRO)

In the background is a quote by former United States Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. inscribed in marble, greeting all who enter Malcolm Hall. “The business of a law school is not sufficiently described when you merely say it is to teach law or to make lawyers. It is to teach law in the grand manner, and to make great lawyers.” This is the principle that has guided every faculty member, student, and alumnus of the College.

President Concepcion talks about SEJA’s unlikely rise to the UP presidency as he was an “outsider” despite being an alumnus and one-time lecturer. Angara’s leadership was marked by “sweeping reforms” like the creation of the University System, that were initially unpopular but later on proved beneficial to UP—something that Concepcion realized during his brief stint as UP Vice President for Legal Affairs in 2011. (Photo by Abraham Arboleda, UP MPRO)

 

“He remained connected to UP,” says President Concepcion, enumerating the many ways by which SEJA continued to participate in University affairs after his presidency ended in 1987—as a member of the Board of the Regents, chair of the UP Centennial Commission, and benefactor of the single largest grant available to UP professors, among others. (Photo by Arlyn Romualdo, UP MPRO)

 

Dr. Emerlinda Roman, who was UP president from 2005 to 2011, recalls how she never hesitated to ask Angara to head the UP Centennial Commission. She describes him as an intuitive person with a deep sense of urgency for getting things done and who never settled for complacency. (Photo by Abraham Arboleda, UP MPRO)

 

Dr. Francisco Nemenzo, who was UP president from 1999 to 2005, remembers how he, when he was dean of the then College of Arts and Sciences, was leery about Angara’s leadership of UP at first, but then grew to respect him as they worked together. Nemenzo says he was shocked by the news of SEJA’s passing as they had just seen each other during the UP Cebu Centennial celebrations earlier this month. (Photo by Abraham Arboleda, UP MPRO)

Former UP Visayas Chancellor Dionisia Rola admits not knowing who Angara was when he was nominated to the UP presidency. Their working relationship back then had since turned into a deep friendship, with her becoming one of his go-to advisers on the issue of education, long after his University leadership has ended.

Volleyball is my favorite sport. It is the reason I became a varsity player in school. I also play basketball, softball, and football.

I also like dance, specifically social dance, because it enhances flexibility and skills. Participation is by twos, such as in cha-cha or tango, and this creates a connection between the partners and it is fun. Also there is appreciation of history in dance.

It would be good if we promoted individual and dual sports such as chess, swimming, badminton, and table tennis. It’s good that we now have swimming. It would be better if we have martial arts so we add variety to the choices available for students. I have encountered students involved in martial arts and teaching it would be an appropriate springboard for those students.

Regarding the UAAP and winning it, we need to focus on scouting. We need more developed scouting procedures. The UP System should scout the different constituent universities.

In our NSTP field classes, we scout for athletes because this is the grassroots, and participants come from junior high and elementary schools. They are given an orientation and background on what UP can offer.

Aside from scouting in different CUs, we should scout outside UP because other universities get the best athletes because of the benefits they offer.

Even within UPMin we need to scout for athletes. In UP we’re really lucky if we get good players such as Juan Antonio Mendoza (BS Agribusiness Economics), our champion swimmer. We’re lucky because it’s an individual sport, which has its advantages.

Winning in team sports presents more difficulties. We may have Ms. Consuegra and Ms. Escamilla, two Palaro-level players, but we need four more players to complete a winning team. So we need more scouting, more orientation outside about UP, and we need to provide information about our existing and active varsity programs for them to aspire for.

We are happy because we had the summer invitational women’s volleyball games last month (April), in which six teams of which five were junior high school students, participated. We declared that our objective is to promote UP and that you are very welcome to take UPCAT and be part of our teams in the near future. We also had an invitational table tennis tournament in May. We need a committee for scouting so we can search for and discover good players.

Two years ago we had a summer clinic in Assumption College in Nabunturan, Compostela Valley Province where we taught table tennis, football, and volleyball.

Our students are also good in cheer-dance and we are proud of the initiative of the Department of Human Kinetics in having a gymnastic workshop to prepare them for the annual cheer-dance competition. Many of our students have potential in cheer-dance and their efforts are very commendable.

I am not a master of a single sport. I play basketball, volleyball, and table tennis. I like them all.

In our Diploma in Exercise and Sports Science program, my favorite course is anatomy and physiology, the muscle, the bones, the inner and outer parts and divisions of the body, the musculo-skeletal system.

We assembled a real skeleton we borrowed from the biology department—the carpals, the skull, all the parts. We prayed before handling the bones. It’s interactive. I was assigned to assemble the upper arm and identify if it was the left or right and the sex of the subject; to discover the form of the skull and many more. In other courses, we learned the principles of coaching, how athletes are trained before and after games.

In Tagum City we observed the Azkals football team. Before the game, when the stadium was still empty, a cheering crowd set up drums and painted their faces, led by a choreographer. The cheering squad was very enthusiastic before and after the games; everyone was very energetic in cheering.

Other topics in our program nclude sports management, sports testing, and observing the conduct of games or events.

We should promote indigenous games and Filipino games, such as sia-tong and others. Indigenous games are from our forebears, their practices that have become games today. Bows and arrows and spears have become games but in history these were for hunting snakes and animals. This has value because it preserves our culture and it’s also enjoyable.

My favorite sport is badminton. Since the elementary grades I’ve played badminton with my friends. In college I had a good teacher, so I enjoyed badminton because the sport can be fast, slow, or low-arcing, and there are strategies involved.

I advocate sports for environmental protection, such as the extreme sport akin to Frisbee, or skin-diving, also known as snorkeling. It is not a sport but a leisure activity. It is safer, accessible to everyone, and you can do coastal clean-up or coral maintenance, or fish identification. We practice “look but no touch,” except for garbage in the waters. Scuba, on the other hand, is sports diving.

We should promote sports for the environment in our programs, such as camping, although it’s more focused on survival training. These can promote the protection and sustainability of the environment.

Now that we have a sports complex being built, we should have more programs for human kinetics such as an undergraduate program in sports. In scouting and recruitment, other schools have certain advantages in that they have primary and secondary schools from which they hone their students until college. Some promising athletes choose a college that is an underdog school, where they can make a difference in pulling up that school.

In our region, there are many individuals who are teaching or coaching sports by experience, but they have no foundation, something which they need.

We need an undergraduate program because those who will teach sports programs need a proper foundation if we want to improve the performance of our athletes. We cannot beat the offers by other schools. We need an alternative system to overcome these disadvantages. Athletes go to Manila because regional athletes do not have the same level of opportunity in terms of challenges and competition and in benefits. We need more regular tournaments, preferably those that are broadcast on television or can be seen widely, so there will be motivation for local athletes to stay in the region.

"“A grand opportunity to serve”: Edgardo J. Angara, 1934-2018 – University of the Philippines",https://up.edu.ph/a-grand-opportunity-to-serve-edgardo-j-angara-1934-2018/,"


He was considered one of the best Presidents the country could have had, one of the most accomplished legislators in contemporary Philippine history, and a respected mentor to junior leaders.

He was a tireless advocate for science, technology and innovation, multidisciplinary research to support national policymaking, education reform, and the people’s right to education.

In his long, colorful life, he served as educator, lawyer, farmer, diplomat, and patron of the arts. Before he passed away last May 13, he was appointed special envoy of the Philippines to the European Union.

But for the University of the Philippines, Edgardo Javier Angara will be remembered first and foremost for his service as UP’s 15th president from 1981 to 1987.

For the UP community, Angara was the president who worked to strengthen UP’s general education program, installed the seven-year Integrated Liberal Arts and Medicine (Intarmed) Program, energized the liberal arts program and strengthened the humanities and sciences in UP, and built a multi-campus university organization. He also rallied UP alumni to support the University during its Diamond Jubilee celebration in 1983 and its Centennial celebration in 2008 as chair of the UP Centennial Commission, serving UP twenty years after his term as UP President ended.

 

 

The boy from Baler

Born in Baler, Aurora in 1934, Edgardo J. Angara earned his Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of the Philippines, and his Master of Laws degree from the University of Michigan Law School in 1964. Upon his graduation from UP, he became a lifetime member of the Pi Gamma Mu Honor Society and the Phi Kappa Phi International Honor Society.

While studying in UP, he joined the Sigma Rho Fraternity. He later went on to found the Angara Abello Concepcion Regala & Cruz Law Offices (ACCRALAW) in 1972, which would become one of the country’s most recognized and prestigious law firms.

In 1975, Angara became president of the Philippine Bar Association, and in 1979 he became president of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines. In 1980, he was founding president of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Law Association.

 

The outsider President

Angara’s selection in 1981 as UP President sent shock waves through the University at the time, since he was perceived as having come from out of the blue—specifically, from the distinctly non-academic world of corporate law. In his biography of the former UP President, Edgardo J. Angara: In the Grand Manner (UP Press, 2015), author and current UP Vice-President for Public Affairs Jose Y. Dalisay Jr. wrote that Angara himself had expressed his doubts about his own preparedness to take on “such a lofty academic position,” given that his only teaching experience to date had been as a lecturer for two semesters after his return from the University of Michigan.

Despite his misgivings, Angara dove right into the difficult job of UP President, working to reorganize and streamline UP’s bureaucracy, revamp its academic programs, and secure fiscal autonomy for the university. Angara’s massive fundraising drive among UP alumni in the country and abroad raised a substantial amount of funds for faculty development, scholarship, student assistantship programs, and massive infrastructure development. It was also during UP President Angara’s term that the UP Colleges of Fisheries and Veterinary Medicine were transferred to UP Visayas and UP Los Banos, respectively.

 

A defender of dissent

Angara’s legacy lives on in part through the UP Center for Integrative and Development Studies (UP-CIDS), which was born from Angara’s vision of a policy research unit that would harness the multidisciplinary expertise of the University toward the resolution of the nation’s critical problems. The UP-CIDS provides a venue for the recipients of the UP President Edgardo J. Angara (UPPEJA) Fellowship to present the results of their multidisciplinary research. The UPPEJA is the largest single grant available to UP Professors, which the UP Board of Regents established in Angara’s honor.

As his son and now senator Sonny Angara once said, his father was “best remembered for defending the state university’s tradition of dissent and obtaining fiscal autonomy. His efforts contributed to upholding its reputation for academic excellence as the country’s premiere educational center.”

 

A storied political career

Angara’s storied political career began in 1971 with his election in Quezon Province as one of the youngest delegates to the 1971 Constitutional Convention, where he authored constitutional provisions such as the protection of public domain from undue exploitation by developers.

After his term as UP President, he was elected senator, first from 1987 to 1992, then from 1993 to 1998. He served as Senate President from 1993 to 1995, then in August 1995, he resigned from the Senate Presidency and was elected as the Minority Leader of the Senate.

Angara was set to run for president in the 1998 Philippine election, but yielded to popular vice president Joseph Estrada, running as his vice-presidential candidate instead. During the Estrada Administration, Angara was named Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Philippine National Bank, serving from 1998 to 1999, before being appointed Secretary of Agriculture in 1999.

During his term as Agriculture Secretary, he implemented his legislative creation, the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act (AFMA), to oversee an improvement in food production programs and support services. In 2001 at the height of Estrada’s impeachment trial, Angara was appointed Executive Secretary following the resignation of Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora, although he only served for 14 days before the Estrada administration was toppled by the EDSA II Revolution."
UP-ICE lauds DMCI Group for support to education – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/up-ice-lauds-dmci-group-for-support-to-education/,"

DMCI Homes and University of the Philippines-Institute of Civil Engineering officials tour the 260-seat David M. Consunji Theater following the recent installation of the facility’s signage at the UP-ICE Main Building in Diliman, Quezon City. The theatre is one of the facilities donated by DMCI Homes to the institution. The tour of the officials was held right before the 1st UP-ICE Recognition Rites on June 20, 2018.

 

Citing education’s lasting impact on nation building, the University of the Philippines-Institute of Civil Engineering (UP-ICE) has lauded the Consunji Group of Companies for its unwavering support for the improvement of the quality of education in the country.

UP-ICE Director Maria Antonia Tanchuling said this in appreciation of the conglomerate’s recent donations to the institution that include a 260-seat theater inside the UP-ICE main building. It was named after one of the institute’s esteemed alumni and acknowledged “Grandfather of Philippine Construction Industry,” the late Engr. David M. Consunji.

“Investing in education goes a long way to all stakeholders from the students and to the nation as a whole. I think that’s UP’s contribution to nation-building—to produce graduates who are not only competent but at the same time who are honorable,” Tanchuling stated.

“So we’d like to thank the private sector for the support to the university all throughout these years. DMCI, the Consunji family have been supporting the university especially the ICE. We’re really very grateful for all the support that has been given to us,” she added.

Inaugurated in November 2017, the P9.2 million-worth modern theater has hosted student assemblies, research colloquia, seminars, and more recently the first recognition rites of graduating students of the UP-ICE on June 20, 2018.

Science, mathematics and economics blended with indigenous arts and culture at UP Baguio’s Media Brunch held on August 22 at the UP Baguio Boardroom.

The UP Baguio Media Brunch was held to showcase some selected research projects that UP Baguio has undertaken through the Emerging Interdisciplinary Research (EIDR) Program and the Enhanced Creative Work Grant (ECWG). Three UP Baguio faculty-researchers presented the results of their research to members of the media, government information agencies, and higher education institutions in northern Luzon.

Dr. Analyn Salvador-Amores of the College of Social Sciences presented a multidisciplinary research on “Anthropological, Mathematical Symmetry and Technical Characterization of Cordillera Textiles” or the CordiText Project. The project documented and studied unique weaving techniques, forms and patterns of various indigenous communities to help preserve this aspect of indigenous culture. The project also designed scientific protocols to improve product quality of textiles from local indigenous materials and to help the efficiency of local weavers in the Cordillera regions. The team used tools from various disciplines, including anthropology, ergonomics, chemistry, materials science and ethnomathematics, to study this indigenous craft. Highlighted were distinctive mathematical symmetries found in Cordilleran garments and blankets, along with their cultural, religious and functional significance. Dr. Amores and her team hope to encourage greater appreciation of the creative artistry in traditional weaving, bring about product development, and rekindle interest in the craft among the Cordilleran youth.

Dr. Teodora D. Balongcod of the College of Science offered “A Glimpse of the Fire Mummies of Kabayan, Benguet, and the Role of Plants Associated with the Mummification Process”. The research focused on the now-extinct Cordilleran practice of mummifying dead bodies, which is done by applying herbal extracts and smoking the corpse, hence the term “fire mummies”. The research identified and studied the herbs used in the mummification process in order to test their antibacterial potential against selected bacteria. Four endemic herbs in particular were identified—bayabas (Psidium guajava L.), diwdiw or tibig [Ficus nota (Blanco) Merr.], patani (Phaseolus lunatus L.), and besudak (Embelia philippinensis A. DC); and the research found that these herbs can potentially serve as less toxic and more environment-friendly alternatives to formalin in the embalming process, as well as a source of more affordable drugs sourced from indigenous, endemic plants.

Finally, UP Baguio Vice-Chancellor for Academic Affairs Corazon L. Abansi, who is also a professor of economics in the Institute of Management, presented “Weaving Colors: A Value Chain Analysis for Tiger Grass in the Cordillera Highlands of Northern Philippines”, a project she and Dr. Bienvenido C. Marzan jointly undertook. The research focused on the walis tambo and the cases of three major tiger-grass producing and softbroom-weaving communities in La Union. The research showed that tiger grass could be a more lucrative source of livelihood if value was added in the products along the chain. This higher value could be achieved by coloring the tiger-grass panicles. By weaving and selling the colored softbrooms, which are softer, sturdier and prettier than the ordinary walis tambo, weavers were able to create a market segment that was more discriminating and which appreciated quality rather than quantity. This enabled them to expand their markets and increase their earning potential. It also boosted the work participation of women and children in particular, and rural employment in general.

The three UP Baguio research projects were supported by the UP EIDR program and the ECWG under the Office of the Vice-President for Academic Affairs, and the UP Baguio Office of the Vice-Chancellor for Research and Extension Program through the Cordillera Studies Center. All three showcased developments in Sustainability Science, Material Culture, and Natural Resource Economics, which are key components in Sustainable Environment and Resource Management.

“Balag, the Musical”, a Tanghalang Pilipino production based on the life of renowned installation artist Luis Yee, Jr., or Junyee, was shown at the University Theater in UP Diliman on October 10, 2018. It shows, among others, how the arts can help change people.

Written by Layeta Bucoy and directed by Audie Gemora, with UP’s own Toym Imao as set designer, Balag conveyed timely messages of determination, creativity, environmentalism, and hope, as it highlighted the artist’s journey toward the fulfilment of his dreams and making a lasting impact on society.

At the end of the musical, Nanding Josef, Tanghalang Pilipino’s artistic director, acknowledged all the artists and staff involved in the production before introducing the man whose life they portrayed.

Junyee himself expressed his gratitude to everyone. He also clarified that the musical is not just about his own “journey of becoming” but that of countless others who believe that “the arts have the power to influence and transform people”.

The event was supported by the UP Office of the President and the Office of Senator Loren Legarda. (Fred Dabu, UP MPRO)

Junyee uses objects that are available from his surroundings as materials for his installation art. After the onslaught of typhoons Milenyo and Reming, he gets the chance to create an artwork on the front lawn of the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP). He intended to use felled trees and branches from around the CCP complex but halfway through, impoverished people gathered these materials for firewood instead. The following scenes portray contradictions and resolutions leading to the creation of the new artwork, Angud, the “skulls” of trees felled by local loggers. (Photo by Jun Madrid, UP MPRO)

Marked by rainy weather, images inspired by the sea, and a theme of “Paglaot, Pagdaong” or journeying far out to sea and going back ashore, the UP Diliman Lantern Parade on December 17, 2018 once again brought the community together for a year-end celebration.

Traditionally the culminating activity of the holiday season in UP, the parade is also held in other UP campuses featuring lanterns crafted collaboratively by campus units and organizations, and group field presentations, most of which often call attention to current national issues.

“Ang higit na malalim na pakay ng lantern parade ay ang pagkakataong magkaisa tayong lahat sa pagkilos at madama ang iisang pintig ng ating mga puso, na tayong lahat ay magkabigkis-bigkis bilang isang katawan, isang diwa, isang hangarin [The lantern parade has served the deeper purpose of providing an opportunity for us to act as one, to feel our hearts beating as one, to enable us to merge as one body, mind, and vision],” President Danilo Concepcion said in his Christmas message to the UP System.

In UP Diliman, an additional feature in the parade this year was floats for the Men’s Basketball Team and Men’s Track and Field Team, whose recent performance in the UAAP exceedingly shored up UP pride and rallied the community to intensely support UP athletes. Concepcion acknowledged this achievement of athletes, and bade them to stand with him on stage.

As in previous years, the UP Diliman Lantern Parade culminated on a high note with the presentation of larger-than-life creations from the College of Fine Arts (CFA) classes and ended with a sponsored grand fireworks display.

Victoria Abaño of the CFA, Tessa Maria Guazon of the Department of Art Studies, and Lee Paje, all visual artists; Nick Deocampo of the Film Institute; and, Vice Chancellor for Research and Development Fidel Nemenzo.

The University of the Philippines has climbed 79 places to move into the top 100 universities from emerging markets.

It is now 87th among 442 institutions from 43 countries, according to the 2019 Times Higher Education (THE) Emerging Economies University Rankings. Its overall score went up to 32.8 from 24.4.

The series of positive outcomes for UP kicked off in 2017 when it surfaced for the first time in the rankings and was included in the 201-250 bracket. Last year, it cracked the upper half of the rankings as it ascended to 166th.

Only countries classified as advanced emerging, secondary emerging or frontier economies based on FTSE’s quality of markets criteria are ranked. Brazil, Greece and South Africa are examples of advanced emerging economies while the Philippines, Russia and China are considered as secondary emerging markets. China leads the 2019 rankings and has seven universities in the top 10. Argentina, Cyprus and Jordan are among the frontier economies.

Institutions are assessed using the same World University Rankings indicators that measure performance in broad areas of teaching, research, citations, international outlook and industry income. However, THE recalibrates the assigned weights to “reflect the development priorities of universities in emerging economies.”

Students from the University of the Philippines (UP) come from all walks of life. Some of them may not be able to afford to pay the full tuition and other expenses to complete their academic requirements. As the UP community transitions to remote learning, other forms of learning assistance are needed to respond to the changing times.

To expand the support to financially-challenged students and expedite the processing support for academic activities, the University developed the Student Learning Assistance System (SLAS). The SLAS is an expansion of the Student Financial Assistance Online (SFA Online). The UP designed the SFA Online in 2014 to accept applications for tuition subsidy and allowance. Beginning on 7 September 2020, UP students may apply directly for financial support and learning assistance in the SLAS Online (slasonline.up.edu.ph). The expanded System will gather information on students’ financial capacity, connectivity situation and connectivity options, and learning assistance requirements to help the University determine the support to be extended to the applicant.

For AY 2020-2021, the SLAS Online will support applications to the following learning assistance programs:

Learning Assistance for Remote Learning

In support of remote learning, the University is providing academic support to college students who would apply for learning assistance through the SLAS. Students from low-income households shall receive monthly Internet Connection to support academic instruction and learning activities this Academic Year. Based on their updated application information, students from the most vulnerable families shall be offered gadgets on top of their Internet connectivity subsidy.

UP undergraduate students, including those enrolled in Law and Medicine, are eligible for remote learning assistance.

To accommodate UP students in need of learning assistance in AY 2020-2021, the SLAS Online will accept applications beginning 23 September 2020.

"Shaping Minds, Shaping Bodies – University of the Philippines",https://up.edu.ph/shaping-minds-shaping-bodies/,"


A healthy mind in a healthy body. A sound mind in a sound body. Mens sana in corpore sano. This old adage points to the ideal condition of a human being’s health—that a healthy person is one who achieves both intellectual and physical well-being.

In the academe, where intellect and brains take center stage, physical wellness seems to be relegated to the background. It may be recognized as an important pursuit but perhaps not as important as stimulating and cultivating the mind.

Looking at the assertion of “mens sana incorpore sano” in the context of university life begs the question: How can one’s mind truly be sound when the body is not equally healthy?

At the University of the Philippines, the need to focus on physical health and wellness was officially addressed by the UP System administration in 2013. Then UP President Alfredo Pascual ordered the creation of two committees: one on healthy lifestyle and wellness, and the other on health and medical benefits.

Physical health for productivity

Health and wellness programs are an integral component of preventive care, in which one of the main goals is to be physically healthy to reduce the risk of developing common non-communicable diseases associated with a sedentary lifestyle.

The World Health Organization (WHO) in a 2002 report said that the risk of having cardiovascular disease, stroke, Type-2 diabetes, colon cancer, and breast cancer decreaseswhen engaging in physical activity. The WHO also identified four domains of physical activity in people’s everyday lives: at work, in transport, in housework, and in leisure time.+

In the Philippines, a comparison of the 2003 and 2008 surveys on physical activity conducted by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute of the Department of Science and Technology showed that in the occupational or at work domain, physical inactivity in Filipino males aged 20 to 65 has increased from 67 percent to 76.3 percent. Filipino females of the same age range, on the other hand, displayed the opposite, with physical inactivity in the occupational domain decreasing from 82.1 percent to 76.2 percent.

Limited physical activity in the workplace may be considered an occupational risk and an organization that provides an enabling environment for physical fitness programs through policies and facilities can maintain and even improve the physical well-being of its workforce to ensure efficiency and productivity.

In UP, the urgency of conducting a needs assessment and developing “appropriate programs and activities for UP faculty and staff to promote wellness and a healthy lifestyle, in support of productive academic and administrative work” was addressed by the creation of the UP Healthy Lifestyle and Wellness Committee in January 2013 through Pascual’s issuance of Administrative Order (AO) No. PAEP 13-01, followed by a number of more localized directives.

From Zumba to bikes

All constituent university (CU) administrations and their respective committees on health and wellness provide support to wellness initiatives by providing funding, granting the use of facilities and official time, endorsing activities, or spearheading the programs themselves.

All CUs are equipped with health care facilities with varying levels of capability—from clinics or infirmaries to a tertiary hospital—that attend to the health needs of their constituents. Across the UP System are basic services like physical examinations of incoming freshmen and annual medical examination of UP employees.

Health and wellness programs, projects and new infrastructure among the various UP constituent units : UPOU Pilates group.

While some health and wellness programs like physical fitness activities are common among CUs, there are some initiatives that are distinct to a CU.

UP Manila (UPM), the University’s health sciences center and home of the UP-PGH, the country’s largest government tertiary hospital, has always been cognizant of the importance of achieving overall health—physical, mental, and social. Its initiatives on health and wellness begin with answering the most basic need: a healthy and safe work environment.

Apart from adhering to standards of health and safety, UPM also emphasizes disaster and emergency preparedness, peace and order, and public safety as crucial to the achievement of a truly safe and healthy workplace. It is in this environment that its employees are enabled to pursue health and wellness. Because of UPM’s expertise, its employees are able to access a wealth of information through training programs, lectures, symposia, and available resource materials.

The UPM community enjoys annual free health consultations at the UP-PGH Health Service and a 20 percent discount on selected services during confinement at the UP-PGH. For students in particular, UPM offers discounted immunization every August as it celebrates Immunization Month, free counseling services, free psychosocial services, and monitoring of suicide risks.

Physical fitness programs that promote camaraderie among UPM constituents include Zumba sessions on Tuesdays and Thursdays and, for faculty and staff, the annual conduct of team-building activities. In a bid to encourage physical activity, UPM Chancellor Carmencita Padilla issued a memorandum in May 2016 encouraging breaks for physical activity from 10:00 am to 10:15 am and from 3:00 pm to 3:15 pm to reduce tension in muscles that have remained in one position for too long.

“A healthy body makes for smarter people, and a healthy mind means better physical health. Academic institutions tend to privilege the mind, and forget the body,” UP Diliman (UPD) Chancellor Michael Tan said in an interview with the UP Forum, so his administration is using the “integrated approach.” He cited three major initiatives to promote wellness: the development of UPD’s primary care facility, the University Health Service (UHS), in terms of infrastructure, services, and equipment; the development of sports facilities to ensure improved access to quality facilities; and “from non-existent Diliman-wide psychosocial services,” the creation of a team that provides them.

The Health and Wellness Management Committee of UPD (later renamed the UP Diliman Wellness and Healthy Lifestyle Committee) was formed in February 2013. The heads of various units were asked to designate coordinators to act as point persons in the dissemination of information on healthy lifestyle, planning and implementation of wellness programs in their respective units in close coordination with the UPD committee, and regular reporting of possible disease outbreaks or occurrence of disease as well as active participation in implementing public health and infection control measures.

Dr. Jesusa Catabui, UHS Acting Director and committee member, told the UP Forum that with the end-goal of achieving a healthy UPD workforce, each unit is encouraged to establish a wellness hub as well as wellness programs. She reported that some units in UPD have already instituted these.

Apart from lectures, symposia, and training workshops on healthy lifestyle promotion and disease awareness, the committee also partnered with other campus organizations like the UP Community Chest in conducting the annual “Walk for Wellness,” among other physical fitness activities. It tackled stress management through a seminar titled“Detoxify your Workplace.” The committee hopes to eventually institutionalize a program on healthy snacks “especially during staff or committee meetings, [hold] a dance fitness group contest and a ‘bike for wellness’ [event].”

In addition to committee initiatives, UPD has policies that prohibit smoking inside buildings, smoke belching, and idling of vehicles. Vice-Chancellor for Community Affairs Castro told the UP Forum that the administration has also funded health and wellness activities and the construction of wellness centers in the UHS and Palma Hall. It was also able to secure a donation of 40 pieces of outdoor fitness equipment in 2015.

The UHS in Diliman and LB

Integral to UPD’s promotion of health and wellness and delivery of services is the UHS, which, Catabui said, has received enormous support from both the CU and UP System administrations. In the last six years, it was able to purchase upgraded equipment and before President Pascual’s term ended in February this year, received allocations of P125 million from the UP System for building renovation and P11 million to replace aging equipment.

UHS services include, among others, primary emergency care, confinement, medical and dental consultations, laboratory and diagnostic services, vaccination, psychosocial screening of incoming freshmen, health information campaigns, nutrition counseling, and dance fitness sessions.

Like UPD, UP Los Baños (UPLB) also has its own UHS, which, the CU administration said, “has been looking after the overall health of UPLB students, faculty, and staff for more than 100 years.” Unlike UPD, UPLB’s UHS is a secondary hospital with operating rooms, a delivery room for normal and caesarian section cases, a neonatal intensive care unit, a newborn screening unit, a dental clinic, a laboratory service unit, an X-ray and ultrasound service unit, electrocardiography, and endoscopy, among others. Improvements to UHS infrastructure amounting to P40 million are in the pipeline.

It has the Diabetes Education and Nutrition Clinic which offers consultations, counseling, and insulin therapy. It conducts relevant screening procedures at least once a month and layman lectures for diabetes patients every quarter. The UPLB UHS also has the Student Health and Welfare Clinic, which “seeks to improve the psychological and socio-emotional health of the students, especially those who are at risk of self-injury.”

Beyond the UHS, UPLB annually holds its sports fest called “Palarong UPLB,” participated in by members of its community. This year, the previously week-long event ran for two weeks and included a tournament of the online battle game, Defense of the Ancients, more popularly known as DotA. These changes were instituted to make the sports fest even more enjoyable for UPLB’s constituents.

Athletic competitions such as UPLB-International Rice Research Institute Dual Meet and the UPLB-Central Luzon State University Friendship Games are also spearheaded by the UPLB Sports and Recreation Committee, which was constituted in 2013. The UPLB administration described its academic and administrative units as proactive in organizing health and wellness activities.

The College of Human Ecology has the Elderly Development Program focused on senior citizens and retirees of UPLB and surrounding communities, with monthly and yearly activities and services that address their “biopsychosocial needs” as well as the annual Senior Citizen’s Summit.

The College of Arts and Sciences’ Department of Human Kinetics, through its Move It or Lose It Program, actively promotes health and wellness by organizing regular activities such as community aerobics and cardio fitness, badminton and lawn tennis competitions, swimming sessions, sports clinics, flexibility tests, body mass index measurements, fun runs, summer fitness programs, and dance programs. These activities are aimed at fighting the effects of inactive lifestyles and preventing injuries due to strain from repetitive motions and immobility—the body’s posture when using gadgets, long periods of sitting in front of and typing on the computer, etc.

Similar to UPM’s drive to provide a safe and healthy environment for its constituents, UPLB also focuses on maintaining the campus as a clean, safe, and well-equipped space where health and wellness can be achieved.

Because UPLB is the recognized leader in agriculture and related fields, nutrition is also a critical part of its bid to achieve physical health. UPLB Chancellor Fernando Sanchez issued a memo in January 2016 promoting the use of quality protein maize (QPM) blend among its concessionaries and caterers. This blend consists of 70 percent rice and 30 percent Corn QPM Var 6, a corn variety developed by UPLB’s Institute of Plant Breeding. It is a healthier alternative to pure rice, especially for diabetics and those at risk for diabetes, because of its low glycemic index and high-quality protein.

Across islands and cyberspace

For its part, UP Visayas (UPV) told the UP Forum that its wellness activities are based on the Civil Service Commission (CSC) Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 38, issued on 30 September 1992. The CSC memo enjoins government units to implement a physical and mental fitness program for its personnel, authorizing the state agencies to utilize an hour each week, preferably 4:00 pm to 5:00 pm, for health awareness programs, and use 20 minutes of each working day, before or after 10:00 am or before or after 3:00 pm to conduct fitness programs.

The creation of the UPV Wellness and Healthy Lifestyle Committee in August 2013 allowed the CU to streamline its health and wellness programs. The committee maintains UPV’s commitment to physical fitness through activities such as the UPV Chancellor’s Cup, an inter-office basketball tournament, the annual UPV Sports Fest, and the Shape UP Visayas Program.

The committee has conducted fitness tests, and organized twice-weekly sessions of flexibility and strength exercises, cardio exercises, and dance/aerobic exercises. It held a two-day seminar-workshop called “Awareness to Wellness: For a Healthier and Progressive UPV” and has facilitated the participation of its constituents in events like Run UP, CSC Fun Run, PhilHealth Fun Run, and other similar activities. It even assisted the municipality of Miag-ao in the organization of a Fun Run to commemorate its 300th founding anniversary.

This year, the committee, in partnership with the UPV Department of Physical Education, has lined up the following fitness activities: Zumba, band exercises, body weight exercises, free weight exercises, line dance, basketball, badminton, stretching, walking, social dance, basic tai chi, and basic arnis.

Despite its academic environment being located in a virtual space, the UP Open University (UPOU) has created a Health and Wellness Committee to cater to the needs of its faculty and staff. Since its constitution, the committee has organized various physical activities such as dance exercise and Pilates. This year, it plans to launch different interest groups in dance, music, sports, biking, and the arts.

The UPOU committee has also conducted lay forums such as “Life Begins at 40,” “UsapingPangkalusugan sa UPOU,” and “UsapingNutrisyon.” Included in this year’s lineup are activities guided by national and international celebrations such as Philippine Heart Month, International Women’s Month, Head and Neck Cancer Consciousness Week, World Immunization Week, Cervical Cancer Awareness Month, and Hypertension Awareness Month, among others.

This May, UP Mindanao (UPMin) Chancellor Sylvia Concepcion told the UP Forum that the CU was about to “start gym services since we just had our gym equipment delivered.”

When the CU’s Health and Wellness Committee was formed in early 2013, it undertook baseline studies among UPMin employees, asking them to answer a survey on healthy lifestyle and looking at anthropometric and physical fitness levels. Since then, it has initiated various physical activities such as sports, aerobics, dance, walking, jogging, weight training, fun runs, and biking.

It also conducted a physical fitness test two years after its inception and last year, undertook a survey among UPMin constituents for their preferred wellness activities. Forums on hypertension, mental health, food safety, and diet and nutrition were also organized. The committee also encouraged participation in annual events like blood-letting for the Philippine Red Cross, CSC Fun Run, parades for Araw ng Dabaw and International Women’s Day, and the Kadayawan Festival.

UPMin also has its annual sports fest called DULA (game), which began in 2013 and is held from September to October. Students, faculty, staff, and alumni join in the games and sports events which include men’s basketball, men’s and women’s volleyball, chess, lawn tennis, table tennis, and running. There are also exhibition games in football, scrabble, and DotA. Prior to the holding of DULA, “warm-up games” are held in some units. The College of Humanities and Social Sciences has Hampang (play/game). The College of Science and Mathematics has Dula-Dula, while the administrative staff hold Pa-UgnatsaKusog (stretching the strength).

UPMin also prides itself in making its campus conducive to outdoor activities and providing facilities such as fields, courts, and a gym to its employees and students. Moreover, the administration encourages local farmers to sell their produce and other food products to UPMin employees.

UP Baguio’s (UPB) health and wellness program also targets both physical and mental well-being. Its Health and Wellness Committee was created to study and discuss policies, procedures and strategies on UPB’s overall health, with particular attention to a “proactive system of dealing with mental health issues aside from the customary guidance and counseling,” according to UPB Office of Public Affairs Director Roland Rabang. For physical fitness, it has Zumba workouts three times a week. UPB has also partnered with the women farmers of Atok, Benguet to sell organic vegetables on campus every Monday.

In UP Cebu, the Health and Wellness Committee implements regular programs on physical fitness such as exercises, recreational sports, and competitive sporting events. Its list of programs and activities include wellness lectures, stress management workshops, counseling, emotional and psychological support groups, interest groups, information sharing, posture and voice wellness training, quarterly campus cleaning, injury prevention, blood pressure and weight monitoring, fitness week, incentive programs, and a health maintenance organization to cover employees and their dependents.

As for employees of the UP System, there are no physical wellness programs catered specifically to them. Because their base of operations is in UPD, some of the health and wellness initiatives of the campus, especially those of the UHS, are also open to them. It is worth noting that the UP System does not have its own Human Resource Development Office (HRDO) to serve the needs of this set of UP personnel.

eHOPEforcurative care

While health and wellness programs move to prevent the onset of diseases, curative or rehabilitative care aims to cure or manage an existing illness. The University also addresses this need. It has a program to help its employees undergo curative care, a new version of which was implemented at the beginning of this year.

The Enhanced Hospitalization Program (eHOPE), approved by the UP Board of Regents (BOR) in November 2016, replaced the Financial Assistance Program for Hospitalization Expenses (FAPHE), which the Board approved in May 2010.

FAPHE provided a one-time P200,000 fund for each employee across the UP System, where hospitalization expenses may be reimbursed after deductions for PhilHealth. In 2013, President Pascual constituted a team headed by Dr. Dennis Mapa of the UPD School of Statistics to study the health care needs of UP students and employees and subsequently submit policy recommendations. Three years later, Pascual constituted a committee to formulate a medical benefit program for UP employees. Mapa, who had already become Statistics dean, also chaired the committee.

Mapa told the UP Forum that during the course of the team’s study, the members realized the scope of looking into the health care needs of both students and employees proved too large and recommended that these groups be studied separately. The decision was then made to focus on employee medical benefits first.

In its report to the UP President’s Advisory Council in September 2016, the committee benchmarked against the medical benefit programs of BangkoSentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) and Metrobank Card.

The committee also analyzed the utilization of FAPHE from 2010 to 2015. During that period, 1,805 employees claimed reimbursements from FAPHE. Based on the number of UP employees in 2015, the claimants made up around 15 percent of the total 12,491 employee population. The average claim was P47,738.00.

Significant among the committee’s findings, Mapa said, were that 56.28 percent of claimants were aged 55 and above, and that 8 percent of the claimants have already used up at least P160,000 of their P200,000 FAPHE benefits, with some already having reached the limit."

From Historical Landmark to Cultural Hub – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/from-historical-landmark-to-cultural-hub/,"


Main Building. That’s what it’s called. A name that’s both nondescript and imposing. It doesn’t say much about the structure. It’s not named after a person, an office, or unit. Yet being called “Main Building” carries that air of supreme importance.

But what’s in a name, really?

One look at the neo-classical, Art Deco-influenced structure is enough to inspire awe. It stands out among the buildings inside UP Visayas’ (UPV) Iloilo City campus. Two large human sculptures representing law and order act as intimidating guards by its arched entrance. At the back, there’s a balcony that will make you think of that famous scene in Romeo and Juliet. Inside are high ceilings and walls decorated by reliefs, big solid wooden beams, chandeliers, and iron grill doors with the letters “IMB” in the middle. Look up at the beams in the atria and notice that their ends are actually sculpted dragon heads.

Story of the name, history of the building

It’s called Main Building for a simple reason: it was where UPV was born, where UP established its presence in Iloilo. It was the first building when UPV didn’t even exist. UP still wasn’t a university system of constituent universities and the Iloilo campus then was considered a branch of the University. It was a resolution in December 1945 by Mayor Fernando Lopez and the City Council that paved the way for that Iloilo branch, which was later endorsed in Congress by legislator Oscar Ledesma.

It was known as the UP Iloilo College and it formally opened its doors on July 1, 1947.

Fast forward to 36 years later when UPV was created. It would focus on fisheries and ocean sciences and Miagao, Iloilo was identified as the location of its main campus. The city campus remained and the Main Building housed the College of Arts and Sciences.

As far as UPV history goes, even the name on the building’s facade has evolved. It went from “UP Iloilo College” to “UP College Iloilo” to “UP in the Visayas” to “UP Visayas,” which is what it still says. Only the text below those names never changed: “University of the Philippines.” Prof. Martin Genodepa, Special Assistant to the Chancellor for Culture and the Arts, told the UP Forum, that they couldn’t find a clear or near enough photo of the building prior to 1947 that could tell them if there was something written else on the facade before “UP Iloilo College.”

Why would that be of interest? Because the building was constructed not because of or for UP. It was meant to be the Iloilo Municipal Hall.

Seven outstanding UP Masscomm alumni to receive the 2021 Glory Awards – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/seven-outstanding-up-masscomm-alumni-to-receive-the-2021-glory-awards/,"


Seven exceptional alumni of the University of the Philippines College of Mass Communication (UP CMC) will receive the 2021 Glory Awards in a virtual ceremony on November 27.

Bestowed annually since 2017 by the UP CMC Alumni Association (UPCMCAA), the Glory Awards honor alumni whose work goes beyond “the usual” consistent track record of excellence.

The Glory Awards were inspired by the legacy of honor and distinction of Dr. Gloria Feliciano, the founding dean of UP’s 56-year-old mass communications program, who served from 1965 to 1985. The Glory trophy, sculpted by UP Professor Emerita Gigi Javier Alfonso, will be presented to winners in recognition of their excellent work and impact on the communities they serve.

The awardees for 2021 selected by a distinguished jury of peers are Maria Luz Balmaceda for corporate communications, Atty. Maria Kristina Conti for social advocacy, Abner Mercado for broadcast journalism, Catherine Garcia-Molina for film, Felix “Nonon” Padilla for the performing arts, Rowena Carranza-Paraan for social advocacy, and Dr. Marianne Dayrit Sison for mass communication education.

This year’s panel of jurors was composed of broadcast journalist Ces Drilon, Visayan State University Professor Emerita Monina Movido-Escalada, former deputy press secretary Danilo Gozo, investigative journalist Malou Mangahas, and writer-director and actress Bibeth Orteza. The Glory also has two permanent jurors—UP CMC Dean and film professor Arminda Santiago and former ANC and CNN Philippines news director Jing Magsaysay, who represents the family of Dr. Feliciano.

Lush, green, beautiful, serene, grand, open, free, wild and, perhaps to outsiders, a little bit odd. These are the words that are often used to describe many of UP’s 17 campuses. These are also, in a way, qualities expected of UP faculty, student, staff and alumni: the capacity to think independently and creatively, a beauty of character shaped by the values of honor and excellence, the ability to adapt to the twists and turns of life, an open heart and, much like the stately Oblation common to all UP campuses, a willingness, even eagerness, to offer all to the people we serve.

Diversity in art and infrastructure

However, UP is not a homogenous system, and each campus is not quite like the others. Each one has its unique strengths, its unique natural environment and appearance, unique infrastructure, and unique personality. This uniqueness is influenced by a wide range of factors, from the history of the campus and its surroundings, to its geographic location and natural environment, to the cultural and ethnolinguistic communities within and around it, and especially to the constituent unit’s niche and field of specialty.

For instance, UP Baguio, whose niche is in Indigenous/Cordillera and Northern Luzon Studies, has the Museo Kordilyera embodying its role in and contribution to Philippine development. The Museo, which formally opened in January, is an ethnographic museum that serves as a repository of the tangible and intangible culture of the Cordillera, and features the output of research undertaken by the UP Baguio faculty in the aspects of material culture, visual culture, language and literature, and anthropology. UP Baguio also has the Cordillera Studies Center, also a repository of research outputs by faculty and research affiliates, which also disseminates research through its publications.

As another example, UP Visayas, as the country’s premier authority in marine science, fisheries and aquaculture, has the Regional Research Center, inaugurated on August 23, 2016, which aims to be the premier R&D and innovation facility in the region, and to support UP Visayas’ vision as a world-class university especially in the field of fisheries and aquatic sciences. Fittingly enough, it is located on top of a hill overlooking the Guimaras Strait, and its glass and steel façade is fashioned to resemble the silhouette of a school of fish moving bi-directionally.

Each campus’ uniqueness can be more keenly appreciated through the artistic, architectural and cultural artifacts that are scattered throughout like hidden and not-so-hidden treasures. UP Visayas, for instance, has among others the Diwata ng Dagat, a 16-foot sculpture by National Artist Napoleon V. Abueva depicting a strong woman standing upon fishes while pulling a fishnet, symbolizing UP Visayas’ commitment to its role as national center of excellence in marine science, fisheries and aquaculture. UPV Iloilo City also has the neoclassic Main Building designed by National Artist Juan Arellano, with its façade by Francesco Riccardo Monti of two bronze statues representing Law and Order.

Diwata ng Dagat, UP Visayas

UP Baguio has Inang Laya, a statue of a woman with open arms, also by National Artist Abueva, and the Four Pillars, four posts that stand for the four pillars of knowledge that UP Baguio started with—Social Sciences, the Natural Sciences and Mathematics, the Humanities and Sports, Physical Education and Recreation. UP Mindanao has buildings that are designed to reflect each ethnolinguistic group in Mindanao, and the sculptures of Mindanao-based artist Kublai Millan in Kanluran.

Inang Laya, UP Baguio

The UP Open University has its Oblation, cast by former UPOU Chancellor Dr. Grace J. Alfonso, and rendered distinct among the others, thanks to the ribbon-like flag swirling around its pedestal, giving the effect of lifting the Oblation to greater heights and granting it boundless reach as befits UPOU’s distance and open education mission. And these are just a few examples from some of the campuses.

Shaping UP communities

In short, there is no better profile for each UP campus than its cultural landscape. The Planning Department of San Francisco City defines a cultural landscape as “a place with many layers of history that evolves through design and use over time. A cultural landscape embodies the associations and uses that evoke a sense of history for a specific place.” Cultural landscapes include physical features such as trees, buildings, site furnishings, pathways and water bodies, and intangible elements such as land uses and associations of people that influenced the development of a landscape.

Simply put, human activity in a natural environment, done over an extended period of time, creates a cultural environment. While it is easy to see how humans alter and influence the natural environment, it is slightly less easy to see how the environment alters and influences humans.

“The environment and the people in the environment actually have a two-way interaction,” says multi-awarded, pioneering installation artist Luis “Junyee” Yee Jr. “The environment first influences the people—the way they move, the way they interact. Then through the years, it is the people who influence the environment, because now they have the power and resources to change the environment.” Indeed, humans change the environment so much that they render it unrecognizable, especially in highly urbanized places.

Luis “Junyee” Yee Jr.

Still, in the beginning it is the environment that shapes its growing human population. “Environment is the one that creates all kinds of culture—Asian culture, African culture, Middle Eastern, Chinese, American. For instance, here we have plenty of bamboo, so we have many objects made of bamboo. Even our houses are made of bamboo. Can the Americans do that? No, not because they cannot do it, but because they do not have the resources—the bamboo,” says Junyee, who is known for articulating the intimate connection between art and the natural world through the use of natural, indigenous and biodegradable materials in his art.

“Ang Tao” in UPLB

Spirit of place

There is a kind of power in the environment, which can be enhanced by the cultural landscape that emerges from it. There is a concept in architecture and urban design called “spirit of place”, which is the translation of the Latin phrase “genius loci”, something artists, philosophers and storytellers are familiar with. In ancient times, it was believed that certain parts of the world are inhabited by gods or guardian spirits whom humans must appease. Fast forward through the centuries to Wikipedia’s definition of spirit of place as “the unique, distinctive and cherished aspects of a place…it is as much in the invisible weave of culture (stories, art, memories, beliefs, histories, etc.) as it is the tangible physical aspects of a place (monuments, boundaries, rivers, woods, architectural style, rural crafts styles, pathways, views, etc.) or its interpersonal aspects (the presence of relatives, friends and kindred spirits, etc.).”

Each UP campus possesses a unique spirit of place, whether it is a campus built on a mountain plateau, near the coast on an island, in a woodsy area at the quiet fringes of an urban center, or in the heart of a dense, bustling metropolis with a history going back centuries. Every person inhabiting these campuses can feel this spirit of place, from the logical scientists to the students trying to survive Hell Week to the vendors selling cigarettes. They move through this spirit everyday, but are often unable to put it into words. “They are unaware of it intellectually, but emotionally, they are. It’s just that they don’t have the time to express it. Put them in a different place, and they will feel lost. You absorb the environment around you without vocalizing it. But it’s there,” Junyee says.

Kublai Millan’s sculpture in Kanluran, UP Mindanao

Most of the time, this is because our minds are too busy with day-to-day concerns to allow us to be conscious of and actively engage with our environment. But some people are able to be aware, and to translate this sublime awareness in ways we can understand, as Junyee points out: “As an artist, I have an active interaction with the world around me.”

The UPLB campus, which he has called home for 40 years, is a good example of campus with a potent spirit of place. And why not, with Mount Makiling practically embracing it? “This mountain is not just a mere mountain. Before people settled and studied here, the original inhabitants knew that Makiling was a legendary mountain. It’s a magical mountain.” It even has a goddess, Mariang Makiling, a literal example of a genius loci. “So if you come here, you feel different. You become part of her. You become proud of her. And then you have the lake, Laguna de Bae, the second biggest lake in Southeast Asia.” Junyee adds with a smile: “This is a beautiful place, and we have the most beautiful campus in the country. We are complete here.”

Despite having been massively expanded and modernized through the years, UPLB retains the spirit of its origins: the College of Agriculture. Its agricultural school roots are also part of what gives UPLB its unique spirit. Junyee, as an alumnus of the College of Fine Arts and a regular contributor to the cultural landscape of the Diliman campus, clearly senses the differences between the two large campuses. For one thing, UP Diliman admittedly has more in the way of public art, due to the presence of the CFA, a bigger budget for art projects and a “cosmopolitan kind of mindset”.

But the UPLB campus, while also free-thinking and just as if not even more internationally-oriented than other UP constituent universities, still retains its “provincial” atmosphere. “We’re very modern here, but the mindset is different,” says Junyee. “Even if there are more students now in UPLB who can afford cars, it’s still different. Why? It’s because of the environment, because of the campus’ birth. Ours is agricultural. And it’s the surroundings,” which do not include shopping districts, major highways, train stations, towering buildings, large, overcrowded housing sprawls, and the other trappings of urban life.

And if Junyee was to pick, among all the famous cultural artifacts gracing the UPLB campus, which one would best capture the UPLB campus’ spirit of place, it would be “Ang Tao,” the sculpture of a farmer with a plow and his faithful carabao beside him, flanked by two towers showing carabao heads. Down to earth, close to the natural environment, steadfast, hardworking, nurturing and most of all, absolutely essential to our country’s future.

Historic designed landscapes

Cultural landscapes are generally classified into four types: historic sites, historic designed landscapes, historic vernacular landscapes, and ethnographic landscapes. Campuses are considered historic designed landscapes, that is, going by Charles Birnbaum’s definition, “a landscape that was consciously designed or laid out by a master gardener, architect, or horticulturist according to design principles…recognized style or tradition.”

The spirit of place of the UP Diliman campus stems as much from its history as it does from its natural environment. To cope with a growing student population, it was decided that UP had to expand. A 493-hectare property in Diliman was acquired in 1939, and construction began in that same year. The first buildings to rise were Benitez Hall and Malcolm Hall, housing the College of Education and the College of Law respectively, before development of the campus was overtaken by World War II.

After the war, thanks to a P13-million grant, the first two buildings were repaired and construction restarted in earnest, with more structures rising within the next decades—Gonzalez Hall or the Main Library, Quezon Hall, Palma Hall, and Melchor Hall, followed by a series of other buildings reflecting UP Diliman’s expanding role as the country’s premier higher education and research institution in science and technology, social sciences, humanities, and policy and governance.

When asked what aspect of UP Diliman’s campus best captures UP Diliman’s spirit of place, UP Diliman Office of the Campus Architect Director Enrico B. Tabafunda replies: “Actually, it’s the diversity of architectural styles within the campus. These architectural styles are indicative of the different stages in the history of UP Diliman. If you look at the oldest buildings, they reflect the early years of UP Diliman, and so here is where our history is rooted.”

The buildings built from the 1960s to the 1970s also reflect another period in Philippine contemporary history, as do the buildings built in later years. Still, Tabafunda returns to the first six buildings, with their neoclassical style, their formal north-south, east-west axis, and their mirroring of each other on opposite sides of the Academic Oval.

Tabafunda also notes another aspect of the UP Diliman campus that captures its spirit of place: the entire campus itself, with its well-designed Academic Oval, its acacia trees arranged to form majestic arcs over the street, its structures and landmarks, its parks, forests and fields—even the street lights that were chosen not just to provide energy efficient illumination, but to enhance the campus’ romantic atmosphere. Each element is a product of planning and landscape designing geared toward what would best serve the UP System’s vision of the University as an outstanding regional and global higher education institution, with the UP Diliman Chancellor’s vision of a campus that inspires pride of place, and is secure, sustainable, connected and nurturing of the spirit of people.

“The landscape is equally important,” Tafabunda says. “It is what gives cohesion to the campus plan.” The landscape acts as a gigantic canvas showcasing the myriad colors, shapes, lines and textures of UP Diliman’s physical structures. “You can have buildings that look different from one another, but it is the campus landscape that brings them together as a whole.”

Diliman’s heritage trees

Tabafunda knows how much of the details of the Diliman campus’ features are planned, all the way down to the kinds of trees that must be planted, and where and how. Yes, even the species of trees matter, thanks to a directive dating from the time of UP President Emerlinda Roman that states that only indigenous trees must be planted on the campus. This means we will be seeing more banaba trees with their violet blossoms and narra trees with their yellow sprays, but no more caballero trees, butterfly trees, and acacia trees except for what we already have.

Speaking of acacia trees, for Tabafunda, it is the acacia trees that give the campus some of its character; one landscape architecture professor has even proposed declaring the acacia tree UP Diliman’s heritage tree. The trees also help prove one of his points. The Ateneo de Manila University campus also has rows of acacia trees arching over its streets, but the overall impressions one gets of the campuses of the AdMU and UP Diliman could not be more different, thanks to their respective landscape designs.

“For me, it’s the landscape architect who provides the image of the campus—the planning, the functions and the visual image and landscape of the campus. That’s why landscape architects are so important.” Each campus will have its own image.

Of course, efforts are made to standardize the images of the UP campuses, to a certain extent. “Sometimes though, you will only have common elements, but you cannot achieve the same standard image throughout. They will all have their own images, because their environments are different, and the period when their campus and landscape planning was made are different. There are many factors involved.” Tabafunda is even more aware of this now that they are currently developing the site for the upcoming UP campus in Clark Green City. While UP Clark will technically be under UP Diliman, it is impossible to create a miniature Diliman campus there. UP Clark will be UP Clark.

A mixed bag

As a whole, the impression the UP Diliman campus presents is…mixed. We have a beautiful academic core, yet we also have blighted sectors. We have buildings whose varied architectural designs span an entire course in modern Philippine history. We have mini-forests, pockets of dense undergrowth, construction sites, old structures on the verge of collapse, paths cut through landscaped gardens, traffic rules and pedestrian lanes that are treated as suggestions at best, graffiti and street art side by side with the works of National Artists—a definite mixed bag."
UP Broadens Its Horizons – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/up-broadens-its-horizons/,"


While everyone wants a UP in his or her own backyard—the System now has eight constituent universities spread around the country from Baguio to Davao—the national university clearly can’t be as national as it could possibly be, given its limited resources.

That said, it’s done its best to serve as many corners of the archipelago as it reasonably could, without compromising the high standards of teaching it’s been known for. Thus were established campuses to serve the major island groups of Luzon, Visayas, Mindanao, and recently, cyberspace.

UP was born in Manila in 1908, but that main campus was soon followed by others in Diliman, which then mothered campuses in Baguio City, Olongapo City, and Clark, Pampanga. UP Visayas comprised campuses in Cebu City, Iloilo City, Miag-ao, and Tacloban (UP Cebu is now on its own). UP Mindanao and the UP Open University were both established in 1995. (While “campus” refers to the physical locale, a “constituent university” or CU can cover several campuses.)

These CUs and campuses were designed to meet the particular needs of their region. For example, UP Visayas developed fisheries and ocean sciences to serve the major livelihoods of the island group; UP Mindanao developed agricultural supply chain management to facilitate the island’s massive agricultural activity; and UP Baguio developed indigenous studies to document indigenous culture in the Cordilleras.

UP has of course also expanded the basis of academic specialization, as in the case of UP Los Baños, which was established to focus on agriculture, forestry and veterinary medicine, and UP Manila in the health sciences. UP Manila then began establishing schools on a geographical basis to provide health skills where they were lacking. Thus, the schools of health sciences in the remote areas of Baler, Aurora in Luzon; Palo, Leyte in the Visayas; and Koronadal City, South Cotabato in Mindanao.

Recently, with the mandate to aid in national economic development now explicitly in its charter, UP set out to focus on key development areas expected to be growth catalysts through innovations in the professions and in industry. And so the UP Professional Schools were established in Bonifacio Global City and UP Cebu’s campus in the city’s South Road Properties (SRP). Both locations are hubs of booming industries and economic activities with a national economic impact.

Either in the final stages of planning or in initial stages of operation are campuses in Vista City in southern Metro Manila; the Agriya agricultural city in Panabo, Davao del Norte; and Clark Green City in Pampanga—all being built under the same academe-industry-community framework for national development.

The new campus being built in Sta. Elena, Tacloban City will serve as a relocation site for the UP VisayasTacloban College and the UP Manila School of Health Sciences in Palo, Leyte, offering a safer place than their current locations, where they were laid to waste by Super Typhoon Yolanda. But it will benefit from design and planning guidelines crafted by the University.

UP Vista City

UP Vista City is in the center of the Calabarzon (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, Quezon) industry growth area and its “technology ecosystems.”

The UP campus hopes to fill the gap in knowledge capital necessary to catalyze an “ecology” for technology development in the area, says Dr. Aura Matias, the chair of the technical working group developing the campus and former dean of the UP Diliman College of Engineering. The campus is envisioned as the innovation campus of UP.

Its curricular and technology business incubation offerings will be suited to the needs of the industrial complexes in the area, particularly the need to level up to local demand and global competition.

The campus began its first phase with the inauguration of its “seed” facility at the Evia Lifestyle Center, Las Piñas on January 27, 2017. Called the UP @Lab Innovation Hub, donated by Vista Land and Lifescapes Inc. of the Villar family, it offers working spaces to start-up technopreneurs and facilitates their linkage with industry and markets. At least four locators were introduced during the inauguration.

The innovation hub was established to attract and employ prospective engineering graduate students through technology business start-ups. They can take technology entrepreneurship and design engineering courses in the initial academic zone to be built for the new campus. In this zone, the campus will offer a Professional Engineering and Science master’s program, the first of its kind in the country.

The technical working group consists of experts from the UP Diliman College of Engineering and Vista Land and Lifescapes Inc. It is supported by the Department of Science and Technology, USAID-STRIDE, the UP College of Business Administration Alumni Association, and industry partners.

UP Agriya

UP, Anflo Management and Investment Corp. (Anflocor) and its affiliate DamosaLand Inc. (DLI) formally entered into a contract on January 30, 2017 to establish the UP Professional School for Agriculture and the Environment (UP PSAE), an extension of UP Los Baños, in the Agriya mixed-use development area of Panabo City, Davao del Norte.

According to the MOA, Anflocor will donate more than three hectares of land, buildings, and facilities to UP, which will offer UPLB graduate courses and short courses through the school. Initially, starting academic year 2017-2018, UPLB faculty will have to fly back and forth between UPLB and Mindanao to teach. The residential phase—when the school will have its own faculty and staff to offer course—is expected to begin in six years."

UP’s relationship with archery is a story of hits and misses. And while that relationship ended for UP Diliman (UPD) eight years ago, no one has so far said it can’t be rekindled.

The first mention of archery as a physical education (PE) course and sport can be found in the University’s General Catalogue 1929-1930, under the PE Department in the Manila campus. It was one of ten PE courses female juniors and seniors could take if they didn’t have deficiencies in prior PE courses.

Back then, PE classes weren’t coed. Males and females had separate PE requirements and choices. But all UP students had to take four PE courses, with the first two being required. Participation in competitive sports including archery by upperclassmen as members of the intercollegiate, intramural, and/or varsity teams could also be “substituted for course work, provided that attendance [was] at least three times a week.”

 

Archery in PE

Soon after, archery disappeared from the General Catalogue. It was no longer listed in the 1932-1933 edition, although it could have been removed earlier.

Fast forward to 1967 when it made a comeback, albeit with limited accessibility. Archery and golf were the individual sports in an elective course in the training program leading to a certificate in PE. It was administered by the Institute of PE, which had just been established in the PE Department. It was to serve as a research and training center to upgrade the skills of teachers and coaches in the public and private schools.

In 1976, the department was elevated by the Board of Regents to a degree-granting unit and was renamed the Institute of Sports, Physical Education, and Recreation (SPEAR). Archery made its way back to the UP general education curriculum, just like in 1929. And this time, you didn’t have to be a female junior or senior to take it.

More than three decades later, in the second semester of Academic Year 2009-2010, UPD offered the PE class in archery for the last time.

“It had to be shelved because we couldn’t sustain it. Archery equipment is expensive and the maintenance of the Archery Range was also quite challenging,” explains College of Human Kinetics (CHK) Dean Ronualdo Dizer.

The range was, at one point, even chosen by the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) to be the competition venue for the Southeast Asian Games. Unfortunately, things didn’t pan out and the 1991 games were never held in Diliman. But the PSC and UPD came to an agreement that same year allowing the Philippine team to use the range for training.

The last record of this agreement appears in the July-September 2004 issue of the UP Gazette. The BOR confirmed the extension of the contract on the National Archery Team’s use of the range until March 30, 2005. By 2011, the national team was reportedly training somewhere else. “It’s like we took back ‘ownership’ of the Archery Range,” said Dizer.

 

Archery as a varsity sport

From the late 1970s to the early 1980s, archery was a UPD varsity sport. That period covers the time SPEAR came to be until the UP Gym’s transfer to its present location from the Law Complex.

The CHK Varsity Office no longer has records on archery. Its history as a varsity sport in UPD can only be gleaned from a few publications, some records in the University Archives, and the recollections of UP personnel.

“I’m not sure what happened to our records when we transferred offices in 1984,” Josie Querimit says. She’s been with the Varsity Office since 1978. “We don’t have any documents on varsity archery here now.”

In Education through the Physical: The UP SPEAR Story, former Dean Celia Bocobo Olivar lists post-war “Sweater” awardees, where archers were recognized from 1977 to 1980. One of them was Jocelyn Guerrero, who competed in the 1977 SEA Games, archery’s first outing in the said event. She was celebrated as the country’s top female archer at the time, winning four gold medals and two bronzes. She finished the SEA Games as number one in the women’s division. The other Sweater awardees for archery were her siblings, Marinella, Margarita, and Arturo, along with Fermin Barrenechea.

In December 1982, then UP President Edgardo Angara wrote a letter to UP archery coach and father to the Guerrero archers, Arte Guerrero, congratulating him and the UPD men’s and women’s teams for their victory in the recently concluded national championships.

Earlier that year, Angara had even written to then Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, informing him that in the last five years, UP “won three [University Athletic Association of the Philippines] general championships, including national and intercollegiate titles.” In his list of exemplary performances, only archery, baseball, and track and field won titles every year in that five-year period.

Querimit says it wasn’t long before the UPD archery varsity team ceased to exist. “Right around the time we transferred to this gym or maybe a little time before that, we didn’t have a coach anymore. The former varsity archers just focused on being members of the national team.”

 

Up in the air

Dizer can’t say for sure if archery is in UPD’s future, but he’s not discounting the possibility of a return—whether as a PE course, a varsity sport, or both. “If CHK had the funds to buy new equipment and the resources to sustain training, teaching, and groundskeeping, then maybe we can have archery again. It’s a sport that Filipinos can really excel in and could possibly bring us the Olympic gold.” He adds that there were proposals to include archery in the University Athletic Association of the Philippines.

Right now, the Archery Range serves as a venue for outdoor PE classes. There are some people, he says, who have asked to use it for personal archery training and basic introductory lessons for children, and that they would shoulder the expense of having the grounds cleared using tractors and heavy equipment.

“I told them that if we allowed them to do that, it would only be temporary because that area is part of the Sports Complex that UP is developing according to the CHK Land Use Plan. They could only use the range on weekends or on weekdays when there are no PE classes. Our classes are still the priority.”"
Looking Back at the UP Diliman Ugnayan ng Pahinungod – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/looking-back-at-the-up-diliman-ugnayan-ng-pahinungod-2/,"


Over two decades ago, UP pioneered the country’s first university-based formal volunteer service program. The program merged from a study conducted by Dr. Maria Luisa Doronila and Dr. Ledivina Cariño that looked into how much value UP students ascribed to social commitment—essentially asking, “Has UP lost its soul?” The response to that study was the creation on February 28, 1994 of the Ugnayan ng Pahinungod/Oblation Corps.

The Pahinungod Program is a legacy of UP President Emil Q. Javier’s administration. The autonomous universities under the UP System had Pahinungod offices under the UP System Pahinungod, which had Dr. Cariño of the UP National College of Public Administration and Governance as the first Director, followed by Dr. Grace Aguiling-Dalisay of the Department of Psychology, UP College of Social Sciences and Philosophy.

In his article published in Social Science Dili­man in December 2011 titled “Empowering the Youth Through Voluntarism: University of the Philippines Graduates as Volunteer Teach­ers,” Dr. Neil Martial Santillan wrote: “The first five years of Pahinungod saw the implementa­tion of a multitude of programs with support from students, staff, and faculty of the different UP campuses—medical missions coupled with training of community-based health profes­sionals and seminars on basic health care; relief and rehabilitation work in calamity-stricken areas; programs empowering farmers as agricul­tural scientists; summer immersion programs for students to gain insights directly from the community; service learning as an instructional method; peer counseling; ecology camps; train­ing workshops for teachers on updated peda­gogical skills; examination for students in the provinces underrepresented in UP (affirmative action program), and deployment of graduates as volunteer teachers in remote areas (Gurong Pahinungod).”

As the UP administration changed, priorities shifted as well, leading to a change in fortunes for the UP System Pahinungod. After UP Presi­dent Javier’s time, a devolution policy allowed the now UP constituent units to decide whether or not to continue the Pahinungod Program. UP Manila, UPLB, and UP Visayas all chose to retain the program in their own ways. The UP Diliman Pahinungod, however, was dissolved, and the task of providing avenues for volunteer­ism were transferred to the colleges’ extension service initiatives, coordinated by the UP Dili­man Office of Extension Coordination.

Here, the people who served as Directors of the UP Diliman Pahinungod look back on their experiences, the challenges they faced, and the lessons they learned about the spirit of volun­teerism and the blossoming of UP’s soul.

 

Dr. Grace H. Aguiling-Dalisay
Professor, Department of Psychology
Former Director, UP Diliman Ugnayan ng Pahinungod
Former Director, UP System Ugnayan ng Pahinungod

 

How did you get started at the UP Diliman Ugnayan ng Pahinungod, and what was it like?

I started off as director for UP Pa­hinungod Diliman, succeeding Dr. Ferrer. It was the late Dr. Cariño who sweet-talked me into accepting the post, but somewhere along the way, Ledy went back to her college, the NCPAG, so the System Director post was vacant. So I took it on, and for maybe a year, while we looked for a Diliman Pahinungod Director, I was director for both. Then when Dr. De Villa accepted the post of Diliman di­rector, I was able to leave Diliman and concentrate on the System.

 

How did you get into volunteer work?

From childhood, because my parents ran a community school, we were always open to these types of activities. As we were growing up, the idea of volunteering was really part of the way we lived. When I was in high school from 1969 to 1973, I was part of the student council. It was the time of martial law so you can imagine what it was like, but I was in an all-girls’ school that had very liberal ideas, so that also fostered the idea of service.

Volunteering with organizations was really part of my life. However, the difference was that Pahinungod was a formal volunteer organization. This is why when I was asked to serve as Pahinungod Director, things fell into place, because as a psychologist, one of my areas is Filipino psychology, which is a liberating psychology. It focuses on kapwa; it’s wanting to serve Filipinos. In Sikolohiyang Filipino, we want Psychology to serve the needs of the majority of Filipinos, and focus on Filipino thought processes, aspirations, the psyche, and relations with others.

 

How did Pahinungod operate as a formal volunteer organization?

This meant that we had to run things like any other organization. We need­ed a vision-mission-goals, we needed programs, we needed to clarify what the programs are for, how to ensure that the programs are well-run, how well volunteers are trained.

There is a formal process of screening and testing, because then, as now, the thinking is that it’s important to do good, but good intent alone is insuf­ficient. As corporate social responsibil­ity programs or business volunteering programs would say, you have to do good and you have to do it well. It’s important for people to be clear about what is expected from them, what they want to do, to behave accordingly, and to know what the entire program is for so that you don’t go there with a messianic view—I’m from UP, I’m so great, I want to save you. It’s really about finding out what is needed, and which of those needs can we meet.

That’s also why we had the widespread programs, because we wanted pro­grams that would match the skills of different people. We didn’t want to turn away volunteers, because the ideal is that you always have something that you can offer.

 

There was never a problem with recruiting volunteers?

Never. Of course, they had different reasons to volunteer; that’s part of the volunteering landscape. What’s impor­tant is the volunteering behavior and the desire to serve the community. It’s really wanting to help out and making sure that there’s a match between the community’s need and the ability of the Pahinungod to fill that need.

 

How does volunteering benefit the volunteers?

I think volunteering lets people look beyond themselves, so instead of thinking about your problems and how complicated life is, you get a chance to engage in positive change. People can see that each one could make a dif­ference, each one can contribute to making the transfor­mation happen, and in the process transform one’s self together with the communities. Instead of the abstract desire of “I want to do good,” concretely, what good can you do?

 

What challenges did you face as both System and Dili­man Director?

These are two different times—the time of President Javier, where he was all for it, and the time after when Pahinungod was not regarded in the same way. It makes a lot of difference. Volunteer organizations would say you need the “buy-in.” You need the top person to support the group. So I think the success of Pahinungod during the term of President Javier was to a very large extent because he supported it. Later on, with the change in administration, the challenge became how to convince people of the value of the Pahinungod.

When I was Diliman Director, the challenge was to come up with more creative programs, because there was a huge demand. We had to think of other programs so we didn’t have to turn people away. You can’t have only five programs when you have a thousand or even two thousand wanting to get in. It really was something that people were interested in.

 

After your stint at the Pahinungod, you were Found­ing President of the Volunteer Organizations Informa­tion Coordination and Exchange (VOICE) Network in 2001. You are also Chair of the Philippine Coalition for Volunteerism (PhilCV), and you were Internation­al Board Director of the Voluntary Service Overseas. Are there any lessons from your Pahinungod days that you carried over to your work with other volunteer organizations?"

Art Blooms in UP Baguio – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/art-blooms-in-up-baguio/,"


In October 2017, Baguio City, already known as the Summer Capital of the Philippines, earned a new title when it became one of 64 cities around the world desig­nated as UNESCO Creative Cities. It was a recognition that the UP Baguio Office of the Chancellor, represent­ing Baguio City’s academic sector, helped secure.

UP Baguio’s commitment to promoting art and culture in Baguio City is hardly a surprise, as UP’s constituent university in the north has been doing exactly that for the past 30 years, and perhaps for even longer than that.

The UP Baguio Summer Arts Extension Program (UPB-SAEP) began on April 18, 1988 as the Summer Arts Festival, which took place in the campus of then UP College Baguio (UPCB). “And when we say festival, consider the magnitude of it,” recalls Dr. Elizabeth Cal­inawagan, dean of the UP Baguio College of Arts and Communication, who headed the Summer Arts Program for years.

Back when the UPCB was under UP Diliman, and with funding provided by the UP President’s Committee for Culture and the Arts, UP Baguio annually opened its gates to the inhabitants of the city and the nearby prov­inces for the month-long Baguio Summer Arts Festival. The event featured a wide variety of art workshops for children and even adults, musical and theatrical perfor­mances by guest performers and groups, distinguished artists and musicians from around the country and even abroad who would facilitate workshops, food fairs, and arts and crafts fairs. In short, the much-anticipated summer event organized by the then UPCB Division of Humanities was a celebration of every artistic endeavor, from the traditional to indigenous to the modern. Dean Calinawagan even recalls partnering with the University of Baguio in holding the Summer Arts Festival.

The Summer Arts Festival was, in turn, inspired by an even older tradition. According to an article in the program for the 1990 Baguio Summer Arts Festival, the event was “also in truth a revival of UPCB’s annual spon­sorship and hosting of the National Arts Festival from the ‘60s and ‘70s.” The political upheavals of the ‘70s eventually ended the National Arts Festival, but when then UPCB Dean Patricio Lazaro encouraged the revival of the Summer Arts Festival in 1988, he intended “to make these activities truly of service to the community at large” and “to promote the development of cultural work and activities [in the Cordillera and] in Northern Luzon.”

Looking Back at the UP Diliman Ugnayan ng Pahinungod – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/looking-back-at-the-up-diliman-ugnayan-ng-pahinungod-3/,"


Over two decades ago, UP pioneered the country’s first university-based formal volunteer service program. The program merged from a study conducted by Dr. Maria Luisa Doronila and Dr. Ledivina Cariño that looked into how much value UP students ascribed to social commitment—essentially asking, “Has UP lost its soul?” The response to that study was the creation on February 28, 1994 of the Ugnayan ng Pahinungod/Oblation Corps.

The Pahinungod Program is a legacy of UP President Emil Q. Javier’s administration. The autonomous universities under the UP System had Pahinungod offices under the UP System Pahinungod, which had Dr. Cariño of the UP National College of Public Administration and Governance as the first Director, followed by Dr. Grace Aguiling-Dalisay of the Department of Psychology, UP College of Social Sciences and Philosophy.

In his article published in Social Science Dili­man in December 2011 titled “Empowering the Youth Through Voluntarism: University of the Philippines Graduates as Volunteer Teach­ers,” Dr. Neil Martial Santillan wrote: “The first five years of Pahinungod saw the implementa­tion of a multitude of programs with support from students, staff, and faculty of the different UP campuses—medical missions coupled with training of community-based health profes­sionals and seminars on basic health care; relief and rehabilitation work in calamity-stricken areas; programs empowering farmers as agricul­tural scientists; summer immersion programs for students to gain insights directly from the community; service learning as an instructional method; peer counseling; ecology camps; train­ing workshops for teachers on updated peda­gogical skills; examination for students in the provinces underrepresented in UP (affirmative action program), and deployment of graduates as volunteer teachers in remote areas (Gurong Pahinungod).”

As the UP administration changed, priorities shifted as well, leading to a change in fortunes for the UP System Pahinungod. After UP Presi­dent Javier’s time, a devolution policy allowed the now UP constituent units to decide whether or not to continue the Pahinungod Program. UP Manila, UPLB, and UP Visayas all chose to retain the program in their own ways. The UP Diliman Pahinungod, however, was dissolved, and the task of providing avenues for volunteer­ism were transferred to the colleges’ extension service initiatives, coordinated by the UP Dili­man Office of Extension Coordination.

Here, the people who served as Directors of the UP Diliman Pahinungod look back on their experiences, the challenges they faced, and the lessons they learned about the spirit of volun­teerism and the blossoming of UP’s soul.

How did you get into volunteering?

I was with a group back in the 1980s to mid-1990s. It was called the Educa­tion Forum, an arm of the Associa­tion of Major Religious Superiors of the Philippines. The volunteers were teachers from public and private schools. We would hold seminar workshops to enrich the curriculum—not only strategies but content as well—because we thought the teachers should make the decision about these matters, not just the administration. The word “empowerment” wasn’t in vogue yet, but I think that’s what we were doing. We asked, how do you make education relevant? So it was education for social transformation. Of course, you needed the teachers for that, so we would hold workshops for both the administration and the teachers to get them started at the same level.

When did you serve as UP Diliman Pahinungod Director?

I came in from 1999 to 2002. Grace Dalisay was System Director at the time, so I took over in Diliman. I was winding up my second term as Principal of the UP Integrated School (UPIS) and began sitting in as Direc­tor of Diliman Pahinungod in Febru­ary. I formally took over around April. I was also director of the Education Research Program of the Center for Integrative and Development Studies at the time.

My teaching at the UPIS was what kept my feet on the ground. Then the UP Open University asked me to han­dle one graduate course on language and literacy, and that’s how I started with the UPOU around 2000 to 2001. Then in 2008, I was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Education of the UPOU.

Tell us about the Gurong Pahinun­god.

My term was under UP President Emil Javier, then President Francico Nemenzo, with Dr. Emerlinda Roman as Chancellor of UP Diliman. Dur­ing my time, the administration was streamlining the budget, so all the offices were asked to be more strin­gent with expenses. So we looked at all the programs of the Pahinungod, we met with the staff and volunteers, and selected the programs that clearly achieved the objectives of the Pahi­nungod. And we saw that the Gurong Pahinungod, which was launched in 1997 in collaboration with the Department of Education, had a big impact.

So we strengthened the Gurong Pahinungod. We incorporated teacher-training seminar-workshops. For ex­ample, we would send volunteers to a school in an underserved community, and we would visit the Pahinungod volunteers quarterly.

The staff would go to a district, assess the surroundings, see what schools were covered in the district, then con­duct a survey on what these schools needed. The Gurong Pahinungod would help the teachers in conducting this survey. Based on the results, we would choose from the expertise of the faculty-volunteers from Diliman or elsewhere for the workshop we would run. So if the teachers said they needed training in English, Science and Social Studies, that’s what we went with, choosing a maximum of three subject areas for the workshop. The visit to the school would last five days, and the workshop three days. In between we would process the Gurong Pahinungod volunteers. But really, the entire thing was a community effort.

Our Gurong Pahinungod volunteers did not come from just the College of Education. They came from Engineer­ing, Business Administration, Economics, Social Sciences and Philosophy, and so on. If they weren’t from Educa­tion, we would offer them programs on teaching and edu­cation prior to their deployment, equivalent to around 18 units, so many of them take and pass teacher exams after their one year of volunteer service and become teachers.

What were the challenges you faced as UP Diliman Pahinungod Director?

I saw the political aspect of it, when they ended the Pahi­nungod in Diliman. I went on sabbatical at the time, but most of my activities during my sabbatical involved work­ing with the struggling Pahinungod. We worked together to fight for the retention of the office. In fact, some of the deans rejected the idea of devolving Pahinungod to their units.

We, the Pahinungod directors, even agreed that, ideally, the Pahinugod Office would oversee the activities of the National Service Training Program, so that the volunteer activities and NSTP activities would be coordinated, with no overlaps and duplications. Diliman could form teams consisting of volunteers from each disciplinal cluster or a blend of disciplines and these teams could adopt commu­nities and develop programs, with the involvement of the communities."

CeBu InIT Shows the Way – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/cebu-init-shows-the-way/,"


The signs were up in Cebu: the site of the starry careers of design artists such as Kenneth Cobon­pue and Monique Lhuillier; recognition from the British Council as a Philippine creative capital, and a local business community eager to adopt creativity as anthem. The University of the Philippines (UP) and the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) had responded to these signs as early as the first decade of the 21st century.

They felt they should be contributing to the economic boom. The creative industries were an obvious niche that technology businesses could boost. Cebu was ripe for DOST’s technology business incubation program.

And soon enough, the UP Cebu Business Incubator for Information Technology (UP CeBu InIT) was in opera­tion, actively seeking out potential start-ups in schools and creative communities.

Established in 2010 by UP and DOST, it embarked on an aggressive marketing campaign beyond the confines of the campus in 2011 to encourage potential locators from Region VII or Central Visayas, where Cebu is right at the center. The facility located on the third and fourth floors of UP Cebu’s Arts and Sciences building achieved full occupancy within the same year, domi­nated by start-ups from outside the campus.

Hotbed of creative technology

The hype was real: Cebu, and the region, was indeed a hotbed of emergent creative technology entrepreneurs.

In six years, UP CeBu InIT has nurtured 62 technol­ogy start-ups, half of which have already graduated. In technology business incubator (TBI) terms, graduation means being able to locate elsewhere on commercial rates and to pay their employees.

“Incubatees—whether resident or virtual—access our mentorship, consultations, training, venture financ­ing, referrals, intellectual property services, etc.,” says UP Cebu TBI manager Jeffrey Montecillos. “There are times when they would feel ready and voluntarily leave. But what we do is conduct our usual audit and advise them if indeed they are ready to move out, or if we feel they still have phases they need to improve. But we don’t stop them from leaving. Of course, the space and services could be offered to other start-ups,” Montecil­los adds.

After six years at full capacity with this graduation rate, UP CeBu InIT is not only an affirmation of the region’s creative technology entrepreneurship potentials, but of the technology business incubation strategy: that indeed, the government and academe partnership can survive and sustainably launch small technology com­panies into business."

Professor, Department of Community Development

How did you get started at the UP Diliman Ugnayan ng Pahinun­god, and what was it like?

I was the first director of the Diliman Pahinungod. We set it up together—Ma’am Ledy Carino as System Director, and all the different directors—based on UP President Javier’s “UP in Service to the Nation.”

Each campus put its own spin on the programs. In UPLB, their clientele was mostly farmers, so the programs are directed toward farmers and agriculture. In Manila, they were more into medical missions. In the Visayas, both students and faculty focused on their exten­sion programs. In Diliman, there were plenty of options; it all depended on the discipline. For instance, Home Econom­ics would focus on food and nutrition, so we would bring the HE volunteers to communities so they can provide daycare tutorials or feeding sessions. We directed volunteers from the College of Arts and Letters toward conducting tutorials for students in the grassroots. The others, we brought to shelter houses, orphanages and nursing homes for senior citizens as the DSWD directed.

Since I come from the College of Social Work and Community Development, I brought the volunteers to the grassroots communities, like the Aetas. The Aeta communities needed rebuilding after the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption. You had to reforest the areas covered by lahar, so we had environmental programs where we collected seedlings from Mt. Makiling, and brought them to the Aetas’ areas to plant. Today, the Aetas communities have become green again. We had resettlement programs in Zambales. I even brought President Javier to the Aeta communi­ties, and we could see his passion for this work in the way he would get teary-eyed during the sharing sessions with the Aetas.

We conducted the Affirmative Action Program, holding UPCAT reviews for high school students in the 20 poorest provinces, so their population would be more represented in the University. We had UPCAT reviews from Baler to Kida­pawan. There were so many programs for volunteer work.

In terms of drawing people in to volun­teer, two things were important. Most of them wanted a meaningful, creative expression of what it is to be an iskolar ng bayan, but until the Pahinungod there was no institution that tapped that overflowing energy to volunteer, to serve, to reach out. We even had prison volun­teer work, which Ma’am Grace Dalisay continued.

 

People were saying that UP had “lost its soul.”

This was in 1994. The time for the heading-to-the-mountains activism was over, and commentators were claiming that UP had lost its soul. So President Javier decided that there had to be a visible expression of UP’s support for government and the other stakeholders in nation-building, and the Ugnayan ng Pahinungod was created. We got in touch with other volunteer agencies such as the Philippine National Volunteers Service Coordinating Agency and the Jesuit Vol­unteer Program, and we looked into how we could institutionalize it.

We easily received funding. As President Javier used to say, it’s easy to ask for money from Congress when you say the money is for extension services. When you say it’s for research, they hardly give any, but when it comes to extension ser­vices for the communities, the congress­men are very willing to give.

 

There was never a lack of volunteers?

Never. From the moment we announced it, faculty and student volunteers would come. They would line up for training and orientation until our office resembled a mar­ketplace. Then we would hold monthly sharing sessions to conduct psycho-social processing for the volunteers. There is an overflowing desire to serve, in any way or expression, as long as someone is there to affirm it, to acknowledge it, and to make them feel that they belong in a volunteer group.

 

What were the challenges you faced during your time as Diliman Pahinungod Director?

There were organizational challenges, such as tension among the autonomous units, and the politics behind the institutions where one official would focus on public ser­vice, the other on science and technology. In our process­ing and gathering activities, I would get caught in between. But in hindsight, these were all positive in the long run, because on one hand, the Science Complex was concep­tualized, and on the other hand, the idea of “service to the people” also took root. So now, UP is both a graduate and research university, and a public service university. The contradictions strengthened our thrusts, creating balance.

In terms of programs for the volunteers, the challenge was where to take the volunteers after their volunteer work. What was the next step in their career path if they are doing volunteer work? Because you have to nurture your volunteers; you have to help them level up. That is what I learned from a seminar-conference on the management of volunteer organizations that I attended in Israel. They need continuity.

And another thing, you want your volunteerism to be rooted in culture. This is another insight from the research we conducted: the Pahinungod is culturally-based. For Filipinos, almost every task is volunteer work. They help their kapwa because that is the essence of bayanihan, of communalism. So you need to nurture and institutionalize that. If the spirit of volunteerism or the bayanihan attitude is present in every region, how do you harness that cultural potential of the people?

Surveying scientific literature, a 2017 article in the British Journal of Psychology spoke of the positive relationship between “greenspace” and mental health and well-being.

“Individuals have less mental distress, less anxiety and depression, greater well-being and healthier cortisol profiles when living in urban areas with more greenspace compared with less greenspace,” said the paper by two authors from the University of Essex.

“If you’re going to be looking at UP, it is an ideal place already, as far as I’m concerned,” Armin Sarthou, UP College of Architecture dean and former UP Vice President for Development, says, talking about institutions with physical features supportive of the occupants’ mental health and well-being.

“The past presidents have seen to that. It was the vision of previous administrations that made sure we have a green environment,” Sarthou points out. UP campuses were granted large tracts of land, which make them ideal greenspaces, he adds. Foremost among these are UP Diliman, UP Los Baños, UP Visayas, and UP Mindanao.

“There’s an architectural effect [in open spaces] that gives a feeling of expressiveness, freedom, etc., as opposed to cramped spaces,” Sarthou says.

(Photos by Misael Bacani and Jo. Lontoc, UP MPRO)

 

“You have breathing space,” he continues. “That’s very, very important to the general well-being of the occupants. Without breathing space, you feel hemmed in, and that probably contributes to that state of affairs [where psychosocial problems are on the rise].”

Greenspace also affords people “green exercise” or the use of natural environment for physical activity, which is also “psychologically restorative,” the paper in the British journal also says.

“You have the venue for physical exertion or exercise. So on the practical side, UP will give you that opportunity, to walk and to run, and so on,” adds Prof. Dolores Madrid of the same college as Sarthou.

Indeed, for many, UP is space in which to frolic, jog, fly a Frisbee, walk the morning, afternoon, or night, and where one can run around on the grass.

And to meditate, says Sarthou, like in the Sunken Garden of UP Diliman. Or take a nap under a tree.

UP is thus the classic greenspace, associated with mental health and well-being of urbanites.

More than just greenspace

Causality between greenspace and mental health and well-being has not been established in scientific literature, warns the BJP paper. But there are theories.

For Dr. Portia Grace Fernandez-Marcelo of the UP College of Medicine and National Institutes of Health, the color green is integral to the concept of home. It is a familiar color. “It is what should be and is seen typically.” Being naturally occurring in plants and trees, the color soothes humankind. “We are used to it,” Marcelo says. “Scientifically, it has a broad band in the visible light spectrum, thus we see this all the time, and familiarity gives comfort.”

Braving two to four hours of traffic every day, Fernandez-Marcelo returns from work in congested Manila to the greenery of UP Diliman, and immediately feels refreshed. She echoes the feeling of other UP Manila colleagues who have chosen UP Diliman as their residence.

 

Humankind is drawn to the familiar color of green. (Photo taken at the open field near the College of Mass Communication, UP Diliman, by Jo. Lontoc, UP MPRO)

 

The concept of home is also affirmed by the architects Sarthou and Madrid as essential in making spaces nurture mental health and well-being. This is especially true for students who are dragged away from home to be able to study in college.

“It’s not merely how a space is used but it is also the meaning of the space to a person,” Madrid emphasizes. Sarthou says that this is exactly the point behind the current UP Diliman administration’s thrust for pride of place. “The Chancellor wants to give UP students, faculty, staff, and anybody who has to do with UP a sense of belongingness and a sense of ownership: It’s home for you.”

What exactly is home in psycho-physiological terms? “Home, tahanan, with its root word tahan: [when you feel] comfort, safe, secure. It means stress neurotransmitters are not in excess; the mind and body are in a quiescent and relaxed state; stress hormones and neurotransmitters are held at bay,” Marcelo explains.

Minding Healthy Minds – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/minding-healthy-minds/,"


Years ago, when we underwent health examinations at the Infirmary before admission to any program in the University, we only worried about registering a normal body mass index, negative X-ray results, and no serious physical illness. Once we cleared these initial obstacles, we got the coveted stamp of “healthy” on our green health certificate.

But is this all there is to being healthy? How do we define and set standards on overall health and well-being?

What is mental health?

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines overall health as a concurrence of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, versus the commonplace notion of health being the absence of sickness or disease. While we consciously work on being physically healthy, and with Filipinos being naturally social people, we often overlook this critical dimension of health.

To the WHO, the state of your mind is an integral and essential component of your health, which covers the growth and realization of your goals and abilities, how you cope with stress, and being a productive member of your community. Your mental health can be affected by many social, psychological, and biological factors.

The WHO recommends that national mental health policies be more comprehensive in a manner that not only focuses on the prevention of mental health problems and disorders, but also promotes an environment where people can thrive and maintain healthy lifestyles. These policies must cut through all sectors, across all income brackets and age groups, from early childhood interventions, social support to the elderly, to mental health initiatives in school and at work.

In order to address the needs of those afflicted by mental health disorders, awareness is the first key step: knowledge on detecting signs and symptoms of these disorders are important to take action and prevent more complex problems like suicide and substance abuse.

Globally, about 14% of the world’s population are affected by mental, neurological, and substance use disorders with a higher prevalence of 11 to 44% for developing countries such as the Philippines. The stigma is prevalent among people with mental health disorders, who are further driven into poverty either by high costs and inaccessibility of treatment, or by being marginalized and denied opportunities at work or school.

In the Philippines, 20% of adult Filipinos suffer from mental or psychiatric disorders, with an average of 88 reported cases for every 100,000 citizens, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority. In the 2000 National Census, 200,000 Filipinos had a mental disability among 1.4 million Filipinos with disabilities. Currently, only about 500 psychiatrists are licensed in the country, with less than 6,000 hospital beds allocated for people suffering from mental health disorders. In UP, most mental health issues revolve on relationships, family, and financial concerns.

The Department of Health has a proposed National Mental Health Policy as its flagship mental health program headed by a DOH Undersecretary and the Director of the National Center for Disease Prevention and Control. It aims to work with other agencies such as the Philippine Psychiatric Association, the National Center for Mental Health, the Philippine Mental Health Association, and civil society organizations to provide mental health services and to engage in policy and legislation, research and capacity-building, and establish an information system and database.The National Mental Health Program Strategic Plan for 2017-2022 focuses on “Wellness of Daily Living, Extreme Life Experiences, Substance Abuse and Other Forms of Addiction, Neuroloic Disorders and Mental Health Disorders.”

OCG facilitates the Buddy Orientation Workshop with students from UP Psychedelics last November 2016.

The role of the University

As the national university, UP’s mandate includes the promotion of mental health and wellness, which is spearheaded by the Office of Counseling and Guidance (OCG) in the University of the Philippines Diliman.

Dr. Violeta Bautista serves as Director of the OCG and also teaches with and heads the Clinical Psychology Program of the UP Department of Psychology in the College of Social Sciences and Philosophy. She explains that mental health is the healthy functioning of the different dimensions of one’s psychosocial being by themselves and together.

She laments how mental health problems in the Philippines tend to be associated with issues related to psychiatric problems such as depression and anxiety. As a result, most initiatives such as seminars and workshops are geared towards addressing these narrower issues. In fact, mental health programs must also tackle issues related to wellness in daily living such as enhancing happiness and satisfaction in life, understanding the self and others, marriage enhancement, experiencing wholeness in the workplace, and finding meaning and purpose in one’s studies and work to name but a few of such concerns. These are all mental health problems, according to Dr. Bautista.

“We certainly would like to nurture intellectual giants, but we would also like to nurture the total person among our students,” adds Dr. Bautista. The OCG’s vision is to have self-aware, psychologically healthy students who are clear about their life goals, who can manage the range and depth of their emotions, and are compassionate and caring towards other people. It pleases her that UP is oriented to a more holistic total-person orientation in education, a trend that is being observed worldwide.

Existing mechanisms within the University

Because mental health must not only be concerned with treating those who are already sick, the OCG offers both mainstream and innovative services. Aside from counseling to address personal and school related concerns, it also offers assessments to support career exploration and personality development. Freshmen are encouraged to drop by the OCG for an intake interview, to get to know the OCG’s services and people and to see how they can be helped. Interestingly, finding the intake interview to be most helpful to their students, several colleges are now institutionalizing the practice among their freshies. With the reported increase of psychiatric and serious psychological problems both here and abroad, the OCG is recruiting psychosocial support specialists, such as graduate students at the tailend of their program, who can provide psychotherapy under the supervision of licensed psychologists.

The OCG is also developing innovative initiatives emphasizing strength and thriving. Modules on stress management, understanding and knowing oneself, nurturing healthy relationships in the campus, and leveling up study habits are offered to address the need for students to thrive and grow. These workshops fall under the Campus Caravan program in which various colleges host roving talks and seminars.

Annual events such as the University Job Fair are also organized by the OCG in partnership with the University Student Council, AdCore, and JPIA to provide students with current and life-giving perspectives on career exploration and job search and to create opportunities for meet-ups between prospective employers and graduating students, which highlights the students’ values and aspirations which are integral psychosocial factors.

The annual Celebrate Life event coincides with Suicide Awareness Week. It is a half day of fun and meaningful activities that invite students to discover opportunities for thriving in the Diliman campus. Perspectives and tips on dealing with stress, anxiety, depression and even suicidal thoughts are shared.

To provide psychosocial support to students, the OCG is putting in place a buddy system, a program that aims to link up naturally friendly students with freshies and other students who need company and guidance. Another key program of the OCG is the “Learning to be a Lifeline” workshop. This is a one-day competency-building workshop for gatekeepers (teachers, admin staff, dormitory and security staff) designed to equip them to spot vulnerable students and to refer them to competent professionals.

In consultation with other units, the office has also crafted Policies and Guidelines on Mental Health and Psychosocial Support which will guide the provision of such services to the students, with special focus on suicide prevention and post-vention.

The University Health Service (UHS) has also integrated a questionnaire that lists down items as a means to identify incoming freshies who may be at risk of psychological or psychiatric problems. An appointment with a mental health professional is necessary to get a student’s clearance to enroll."

With the passage of the Philippine Mental Health Law or Republic Act 11036, the focus on mental health and related services has intensified. Signed last June 21, 2018, the law aims to integrate mental health care in the country’s existing systems. With institutional pathways already set within the University on matters concerning mental health, what are its biggest stakeholders initiating at their end?

Coping through an organization

For COPE UP’s founder Dhan De Leon, it all started when he battled depression four years ago and he had to take a leave of absence from school. When he came back, he took a counseling elective from the College of Education and met Professor Lorelei Vinluan.

“She was very vocal about helping students and counseling them,” recalls Dhan. Armed with a robust support system of family and friends, De Leon pledged to do something to help address the rising incidents of mental health issues in the University. What was initially envisioned as a support group system evolved into COPE UP, a university-wide organization “raising mental health awareness and providing a sound environment for individuals experiencing mental health disorders, problems, and other mental health-related challenges inside and outside the University,” according to its Facebook page.

Currently, the organization has about 80 active members from an initial 23 spread across different colleges such as Business Administration (CBA), Science, Engineering, and Social Sciences and Philosophy (CSSP) whose members are Psychology majors.

In its founding year, COPE UP was able to conduct five mental health modules with topics including stress management and child psychology.

The organization also held workshops for its members through partnerships with Neuro-Linguistic Programming Manila and the University Student Council, where COPE UP assisted in the drafting of a mental health awareness module for Diliman organizations, sororities, and fraternities. In the near future, the organization plans to strengthen its internal dynamics by tapping professionals to facilitate trainings on peer counseling.

 

Leadership through service

As the local representative bodies of each of the 19 colleges in UP Diliman, the college student councils are tasked to develop campaigns, events, and services with the welfare of their own constituents in mind.

In the School of Economics (SE), the student council provided simple services such as free bubble wrap and stress balls, free food, and a day when they could pet dogs on campus. A campaign was also launched called “Diwa,” which allowed students to undergo free consultation sessions with psychologists, psychiatrists, and counselors.

“Diwa” was particularly challenging, according to SE Student Council Chair Josh Quimbo, because they had to ensure that the students’ identities would not be exposed.

 

It’s the little things that go a long way, according to SESC Chair Quimbo. (Photo from UP SESC)

 

Former Engineering Student Council (ESC) Public Relations Councilor Jason Fernandez talked about #SpeakOut, a mental health awareness campaign that kicked off with the ESC joining the Youth for Mental Health Coalition, and continued with a signboard campaign to push for a mental health law and a department caravan to hold mental health seminars in the college. The ESC also released a video series with #SpeakOut ambassadors expressing their sentiments about various mental health issues.

In the case of Malcolm Hall, the Law Student Government (LSG) formed its own Mental Health Committee and celebrated “Kalinaw,” a series of events dedicated to increasing awareness and breaking the stigma attached to mental health disorders. Headlining the week was the forum called “Bar Blues: A Talk on Spotting Depression and Anxiety, and Living With Them” and “Are You Having A Ruff Time?”, which brought therapy dogs from CARA Welfare Society to the halls of Malcolm. A primer and blog were also launched, along with a freedom wall during the week, and free film viewings for one day.

LSG President Chris Alquizalas says that the LSG was glad to have found a number of willing volunteers to help make the events a success. In the end, the goal is clear: to have an environment that is open and receptive to mental health issues, and to work together with the proper institutions in finding real and concrete solutions to address these issues.

THE FREEDOM OF INTELLIGENCE

By Dr. Jose Y. Dalisay Jr.

Vice President for Public Affairs

 

Speech delivered at the 39th anniversary of Health Sciences Center autonomy and the 36th UP Manila Day, UP Manila, October 22, 2018.

 

I’m very glad to be here in UP Manila, which I consider to be UP’s historic home, the cradle of its spirit, of its ideals and traditions. In keeping with that spirit, I’ll speak today about the freedom to think, to speak, to study, and to teach—things which we in UP tend to take for granted, but shouldn’t, and I’ll tell you why.

 

A few weeks ago, I received a flurry of messages from the media, asking me to comment in my official capacity on allegations expressed by the police and military to the effect that the University of the Philippines, among others, was a recruiting ground for anti-government rebels. I resisted the urge to respond immediately, and said instead, carefully, that I had nothing to say because we had yet to see a copy of the report on which the military’s charges were presumably based.

 

I don’t know if that reached the other side, but the next day, the police came out with another statement citing the brainwashing of students by showing them anti-martial law movies, and the anti-government positions taken by some UP professors. I was glad because they had provided more specifics, which people could now evaluate for their merits. Was watching a film denouncing martial law a subversive act? Was criticizing government a crime? The outrage that followed those ridiculous propositions proved that their apprehensions about UP in 2018 were no more tenable than the charges laid against freethinkers on campus back in the 1940s.

 

As you can imagine—as a veteran of the First Quarter Storm and the Diliman Commune, and as someone who spent most of his 19th year in martial-law prison—I would have had a mouthful to say about those accusations. But as a doddering senior and university official, I thought that I would leave the fireworks to others and frame a more measured if more leisurely response.

 

For this I will draw less on the present than on the past, specifically on a yet unpublished history of UP that I helped edit about fifteen years ago, when I first became VP. This way I hope history can help inform—maybe temper, maybe inflame—the passions that drive us so singularly today. For as serious and even life-threatening as the military’s allegations may be, there is something instructive and even amusing to be found in stepping back into the past.

 

Let’s go back to those questions: Is UP a recruiting ground for rebels? The only sane and honest way of answering this is to say of course it is; it always was. It’s no big secret that rebellion and resistance are coded into UP’s DNA, because we have always encouraged critical thinking, which in turn encourages—at least for a while, until complacency sets in—an attitude of dissidence, of anti-authoritarianism, of rejection of the status quo. That’s how knowledge happens, that’s how it begins, as every scientist since Galileo has affirmed.

 

Apply that to the political sphere, and not surprisingly, UP has for the past century been a crucible of protest, against both internal and external forces seeking to influence its constituents’ thoughts and actions. Those protests and their causes have ranged from tuition fees, uniforms, and substandard facilities to unfair dismissals, Malacañang interference, foreign control of our destiny, and the overhaul of Philippine society itself.

 

In 1928, a law prescribed the wearing of uniforms by students in all public schools, including UP. The uniform for men was a white suit (khaki on rainy days); for women, a white blouse and dress reaching three inches below the knees. UP students opposed the measure, and President Rafael Palma supported them.

 

In 1933, the first student protest against a tuition fee increase, from P30 to P50 per semester, took place at the College of Education in the form of a boycott led by, among others, Fe Palma—the daughter of the President.

 

The resistance got more serious when it came to political interference in UP affairs. In the early ‘30s, a young law student named Arturo Tolentino drew the ire of his dean, Jorge Bocobo, when he wrote an article in the Collegian taking a position on Philippine independence that countered that of then Senate President Quezon, whom Bocobo supported. Bocobo had 900 copies of the Collegian burned. Tolentino appealed to President Palma, who supported him. Infuriated, Quezon punished Palma—and the entire University—by removing UP’s lump-sum allotment and requiring it instead to submit an itemized budget. Palma’s woes didn’t end there. When he retired after ten years of service to UP, the Quezon-packed BOR voted against giving him any kind of terminal bonus. (But when Palma died in 1939, Quezon went to his funeral and offered generous praise for his former adversary.)

 

Quezon was a notorious meddler in UP matters, often coming to Padre Faura from Malacañang astride a white horse. He once even attended a BOR meeting to try and settle, once and for all, the valid causes for which professors could be fired—in other words, the parameters of academic freedom. But his mind wasn’t so simply anti-academic. Appreciating how lowly paid teachers were, he moved to grant tenure to professors to secure their jobs and, yes, their academic freedom.

 

A young UP law student even attacked Quezon for his “frivolity,” accusing Quezon of throwing lavish parties in Malacañang while the country suffered under the Americans. The student’s name was Ferdinand Marcos. Another law student, and president of the Student Council, led a rally which was met by Quezon himself at the quadrangle. Quezon charmed them, and the protest fizzled out. That student leader was Jose B. Laurel, the son of the future President and himself the future Speaker of the House.

 

This didn’t stop with Quezon. When President Quirino demanded courtesy resignations from all government officials, UP President Bienvenido Gonzalez refused to tender his, to protect UP’s autonomy.

 

In the 1950s, at the height of McCarthyism, the Congressional Committee on Anti-Filipino Activities conducted a witch-hunt for communists in UP; the committee was led by Cong. Leonardo Perez, himself a former Collegian editor. A throng of 3,000 students led by Heherson Alvarez and Reynato Puno marched to Congress in protest. But some other UP students sided with the witch-hunters. When President Garcia went to UP to inaugurate the University Theater, he was met by placards saying, “Mr. President, Why Tolerate Communism in the University?”

 

Diosdado Macapagal made few friends in UP when, upon assuming office in 1962, he announced that his choice for next UP President was Carlos P. Romulo, practically bypassing the Board of Regents. Macapagal got his way.

 

About Macapagal’s successor Marcos, I can only say that as a 17-year-old participant in the Diliman Commune, I carried but never got to throw a Molotov cocktail—but I would have if I had to, firm in the belief that the military had no right to drive their armored vehicles onto UP grounds. One night during the Commune, we snuck out of the campus in the backseat of a car driven by Prof. Alfredo V. Lagmay to publish what we called the Free Collegian. One year later, martial law was imposed, and what freedom we had would be lost for a long dark period.

 

I cite these instances not just to show how tenuous the relationship between UP and the Palace has always been, but also how time can make an ironic mockery of our experience.

 

Some of these protesters were Marxists and Communists, or were soon to be; most were not. As I have always emphasized to my audiences whenever I talk about martial law, the Left has always been in the minority, in UP and in society in general. It just happens to be well organized, loud, and influential, which accounts for the hysteria in response to its growth.

 

True, since the 1940s, many of the leaders of the Communist Party of the Philippines (the old and the new) have come from UP, from the fascinating Lava brothers to the English major Joma Sison. But UP has also bred Presidents Laurel, Roxas, Macapagal, Marcos, and Macapagal-Arroyo. Ramon Magsaysay and Fidel Ramos both spent time in UP before moving elsewhere. We can add hundreds of senators, congressmen, Supreme Court Justices, Cabinet secretaries, and icons of industry, the arts, the sciences and the professions to this list.

 

In other words, UP has attracted all kinds—communists and socialists, yes, but also capitalists, ultraconservative Catholics and born-again Christians, Rizalist cultists, military agents, the Ananda Marga, and Muslim separatists. Our 300,000 alumni can count saints as well as scoundrels, Jedi Masters and Sith Lords, democrats and demagogues.

 

And the same thing can be said of top global universities like Cambridge, which in the 1930s was home to what came to be known as the “Cambridge Five,” led by the top Soviet spy Kim Philby. Harvard’s Law School was said to be dominated by Left-leaning professors and students in the 1960s, although the Harvard Republican Club has since risen in prominence. There’s a Communist Party of Canada Club at the University of Toronto, alongside an American Culture Club and a Chinese Christian Fellowship. Even Wharton has a Marx Café, an underground club of Marxist enthusiasts.

 

UP’s less-famous but reputed Communists included the delightfully eccentric professor of English Ignacio Manlapaz, who sang Wagnerian operas in class, taught Marx and Hegel, and gave students a piece of chalk with the cryptic instruction: “This is the subject. Write.”

 

I would posit that the true heart of UP lies neither in the Right nor the Left, but in that great liberal middle—“liberal” with a small “L”—whose members value the freedom to think, to speak, to study, and to teach, subscribing neither to State propaganda nor to Party doctrine, but trusting their own reason and education to illumine the way forward.

 

I locate myself in this middle, coming to UP from both extremes—as a sometime public-relations man for a government ministry under martial law, which I left to march at EDSA, and also as a former member of the hardcore Left, whose bright red star has sadly dimmed in my eyes in the wake of its internal purges and more recently in its opportunistic dance with despotism.

 

In this broad middle, we may quarrel passionately over the distribution of units among the humanities and the sciences in our GE program, but we will link arms, almost instantly and without need of exhortation, when it comes to any form of repression, especially of our academic freedom. Do not mistake this middle for just “Yellows” or robots for certain candidates. We may have voted differently in the last election, but our principles go beyond persons and presidencies. If there is anything we will die for, it is country, family, and university—not necessarily in that order.

 

We badly need to refresh the tone and quality of discourse in the University, and to rescue it from the trolls and the sloganeers. We must secure and defend the University as a zone of free thought and free speech—ironically, no matter what they may espouse, and no matter how obnoxious—employing reason to distinguish truth from lies, and right from wrong. We must resist intolerance, wherever it comes from, mindful that Left and Right can be as intolerant as the other—toward each other and to anyone in between.

 

Indeed, these days, I have often had a problem distinguishing between Left and Right. Historically, the Left itself has always been a rich recruiting ground for the Right—the disaffected, the corruptible, the cynical. Nothing makes a better reactionary than a former rebel.

 

Some people I once respected and admired, even idolized, for their courage and commitment in fighting the dictatorship half a century ago are now among the most ardent and artful defenders of strongman rule, deploying their ample talents in the service of falsehood. Former comrades who once barked loudly against the Marcoses and were even imprisoned by them have now become their lapdogs, their apologists and strategists. Jedi Masters have become Sith Lords.

Uplifting Lives through Interior Design – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/uplifting-lives-through-interior-design-2/,"


Which school should lead in integrat­ing public service in its undergraduate courses but the public service university itself, UP? UP’s Interior Design pro­gram is a trailblazer. Since more than 15 years ago, it has left the studio for its application course in order to embrace public service, an initiative that has given its students an edge over others.

The decision to take this untrodden path followed an era of soul-searching in the University, where a study in the early 1990s revealed that students ranked social orientation and moral uprightness far down in the order of importance of the qualities their colleges were developing in them. Reaching out to the community became a buzz-word, with UP Vice President for Public Affairs Ledivina Cariño promoting service learning as “learning to serve, and serving to learn.”

A basic need

The College of Home Economics led by Dean Cecilia Florencio was one of the first to respond by serving the poor of nearby Libis. The Interior Design program saw an opportunity to turn the impression of Interior Design as elitist on its head. From the beginning, it was the wrong impression, Interior Design professor Adelaida Mayo says. She places Interior Design as a basic need.

“There’s food, clothing, and shelter. Architecture deals with shelter, but where is its soul? It’s in the space people use. It’s inside. The shelter will just be the shell of it,” Mayo says.

She raises the question of livability: the lack of finances precludes enjoying the benefits of proper interior design. “In low-cost housing, for example, there is really no Inte­rior Design team to do it. And that has led to problems and accidents.”

The advocacy for democratizing Interior Design must start with students. They must have the opportunity to directly touch people’s lives through the discipline they have been studying in the past three years, and to understand the enormous public service potential of their field.

Going into direct public service was a practical alterna­tive for an application course, which aims to “apply the knowledge, skills and competencies acquired and devel­oped during the first three years of extensive training in interior design through a special project of their choice.”

Beyond the studio

For a long time, students of Interior Design were apply­ing their skills only in the studio. This is understandable as designing actual interiors and implementing them requires a license, which students could not possibly have before graduation. They were compelled to simulate interior space, staging mock-ups of walls and ceilings and floors, furnishing, decorating and then exhibiting them inside halls, which was an expensive affair. But the resources went to waste in the inevitable dismantling for the egress. The students had no idea how their designs would have held up in actual use.

Mayo and Raquel Florendo, who were handling the two classes of ID 179 Special Projects Class, broached the idea of merging their classes to serve financially challenged institutions whose spaces were in dire need of rehabilita­tion. The students would be under the close supervision of the professors, whose licenses would take care of the legal requirements for the projects.

The students discussed the proposal among themselves and accepted the new challenge of the class. Grouped into teams, they helped look for project sites. They con­sulted with, and proposed designs for screening by, their professors. They coordinated among themselves to unify their concepts. Making cost estimates, they then set out to raise funds and get sponsorships.

In academic year 2001-2002, ID 179 Special Projects rolled out in eight cottages of the Department of Social Welfare and Development’s Reception and Study Center for Children; the clinic and therapy rooms of the Golden Acres Home for the Aged; and a model unit for Gawad Kalinga. At the end of the first semester, what had been dark, dreary, and beat-up spaces had turned into bright and proper spaces to welcome back children recovering from trauma, the aged regaining strength and positive outlooks, and the poorest of the poor reclaiming their dignity."

A globally competitive UP Diliman genuinely serving the people

The first to present his vision and plans for a UP Diliman that is “Globally Competitive and Genuinely Serving the Filipino People” was UPCoE Dean Manegdeg. He stressed the importance of “strong and experienced academic leadership” in UP, saying that UP Diliman “has to find its way back on track and its leadership needs to improve the development and promotion of programs”. He cited the need for a revamped UP Diliman administration and units exercising full autonomy to raise the standard of learning to Education 4.0. “We are often, if not always, proud about excellence and expertise in our respective fields. However, it is lamentable and disappointing to realize that we are actually lagging behind other nations now in terms of quality of education,” he said.

Often referring to developments at the UP College of Engineering as an example, Manegdeg said he would bring his vision of UP Diliman to fruition through the acquisition of high-speed computers to be used to access research laboratories outside the country and help digitalize course offerings of all units. He emphasized the need for a new administration that implements timely appointments for all employees, that will not limit the full potential of its different and unique units or curtail the progress of its colleges, and that “will never be a dictatorship as accused by some who are the actual dictators in the guise of being democratic”.

For Manegdeg, academic governance would be dedicated to the betterment of faculty, REPS, administrative staff, students, alumni and other stakeholders. Pro-faculty endeavors would include: strengthening faculty incentives such as professorial chair awards; institutionalizing resource generation by negotiating value-for-work commissioned research and projects; and, promoting output-based teaching, progressive research and creative work, and effective public service. REPS would be made part of the faculty as lecturers, enabling them to get additional benefits and incentives; and a REPS chair awards would likewise be created. Administrative staff would acquire security of tenure or permanent items, the practice of contractualization would be put to an end, and an administrative chair award would also be put in place. Student needs would be addressed with the addition of campus-wide student wellness rooms, 24/7 learning spaces, decent tambayans, on-site guidance counselors and diversified student activities. There will be a campaign for more undergraduate and especially graduate students at UP Diliman, which will entail the construction of more dormitories. Finally, alumni will be given opportunities to give back in the form of return service to the University.

His plans also include: a decent housing policy for faculty, REPS and administrative staff;  promoting consistency of curricula, including the migration of five-year courses to four; and, commissioned research on supply and demand of each degree offering to reflect the gaps where UP should focus on. To promote the arts, exhibits on an international level would be held twice a year to internationalize UP Diliman’s artists and their works; likewise, international conferences would be hosted by the other academic clusters twice a year, with funding made available for such projects. Each unit would also house a museum and information center; and, the campus would be sectorized according to clusters:the Arts Paradise, Technology Haven, Innovation Mecca, Technopreneurship Center and the like. Manegdeg also mentioned elevating the UP Archaeological Studies Program to the level of school—the UP School of Archaeology.

“Activism is alive and vigilance will continue to thrive in our University. UP Diliman shall be open to all ideologies without excluding another,” he stated. With regard to national security the UP Department of Military Science and Tactics will be transformed into the National Security Leadership Institute, as “it is about time to have a UP brand on the interest of National Security.” The UP Extension Program in Pampanga and Olongapo will likewise be readied for their elevation into a UP constituent university. UP Diliman will also form a quick response group to aid and assist communities affected by natural disasters.

“It is imperative that the incoming UP Diliman chancellor should be firmly committed to help UP President Danilo Concepcion build an iconic University. Furthermore, this has to be complemented with efficient and sustainable administrative processes and effective curricular changes that are universally acceptable and primarily benefit our nation. Therefore,” he concluded, “there must be a rightful change in the UP Diliman leadership, not a continuation of the past six-year administration.”

An inclusive, diverse and public service-oriented UP Diliman

Vice-Chancellor Fidel Nemenzo followed with his presentation, “Re-Imagining UP Diliman as an Academic Center of Excellence; Inclusive, Diverse and Public Service-Oriented”. Beginning with his personal history growing up in UP Diliman, he said of his activist roots: “Noon pa man, malinaw na sa akin na ang UP ay naninindigan at lumalaban. Ang UP ay nakikilahok, nakiiisa at lumalaban para sa bayan. Sabihin mang pula ang kulay ng protesta, hindi ko kinahihiya ang marka ng tradisyon ng pakikibaka na aking pinagmulatan at kinalakihan.”

His vision is of a UP Diliman that would play a critical role in helping the country attain parity with developed countries, and for our society to navigate the rapid global and economic transformations brought on by advancements in digital technology. Thus, he envisioned UP Diliman as a modern research university with a public mission, building upon the gains of previous administrations and learning from the successes and shortcomings of the past, and harnessing UP Diliman’s unique diversity to create fertile ground for critical and innovative thinking. He will likewise promote UP Diliman as an inter-disciplinary hub working with various sectors and communities in society to draw up responses to policy questions and development challenges.

In terms of promoting academic excellence, Nemenzo plans to continue to cultivate the spirit of critical inquiry and challenge the community to seek new ways of solving problems, bringing together the best minds across disciplines to address these problems through research. He also plans to enhance the digital infrastructure, tools and applications that would facilitate world class research.

The General Education program would be strengthened, alongside the specializations. Support for the varsity teams and sports programs would continue, while music, theater, literature and art programs would be bolstered. Internationalization would be pursued, but grounded on the recognition of our duty to our own nation, which entails improving academic programs to enhance our capability to serve our country. If selected chancellor, he plans to propose a multi-disciplinary discussion on the metrics of academic performance.

Nemenzo stated in his vision that “academic excellence can only thrive under conditions of openness and respect for diversity.” Hence, he is committed to defend UP as a safe space where free thought and free speech are practiced responsibly, and where collegiality and respect prevail.

In terms of democratic governance, according to Nemenzo, a chancellor’s role is not only to support the University’s free-thinking scholars and artists, but to imbue them with a sense of purpose and inspire them toward higher goals. To do this, transparency and accountability in decisions and actions would be promoted by enhancing public information systems, and instituting functional grievance and feedback mechanisms. “As chancellor, I will strengthen efforts to uphold democratic rights by conducting regular consultations on academic personnel and community concerns, with a view to empowering our students, faculty, REPS and staff” he added.

In terms of promoting the well-being and dignity of the academic community through the creation of a nurturing and enabling environment, Nemenzo plans: to expand the services of the Diliman Learning Resource Center and further support initiatives such as the Kapihan sa Diliman, a 24/7 study space for students; to provide more adequate housing, healthcare and other services by continuing to upgrade the UP health services and its primary care program; to advance gender equality by strengthening support for forefront offices such as the Diliman Gender Office, the Office of Anti-Sexual  Harassment, and the Center for Women’s and Gender Studies; and, to  promote mental health awareness and well-being by pushing for the institutionalization of the PsycServ program. As for UP Diliman’s communities of informal settlers, Nemenzo plans to work with the city government and other relevant agencies to provide satisfactory relocation sites.

In terms of administrative and operational efficiency, Nemenzo plans to create a comprehensive data management system to help the UP administration make timely and effective policy decisions. To ensure safety and disaster preparedness on campus, the UP Diliman Police and Special Services Brigade would be provided more support and training. He would also work with the UP Resilience Institute and the Quezon City Government to improve UP Diliman’s capacity for disaster risk reduction, preparedness and response. Nemenzo also declared his commitment to the protection and revitalization of UP Diliman’s natural environment.

UP Manila team effort celebrated – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/up-manila-team-effort-celebrated/,"


UP Manila celebrated the 39th anniversary of its autonomy as the country’s Health Sciences Center and the 36th of its name, UP Manila, on October 22, 2018, with an affirmation of the virtues “Mahusay, Makabuluhan, Pampagbabago” (roughly translated, excellent, relevant, change-oriented).

The celebrations included the blessing of new and renovated facilities, the ground-breaking for an 11-story medical sciences building, the launch of research and student-support programs, and an awards ceremony for UP Manila constituents.

UP President Danilo Concepcion attended the celebrations, signing a Memorandum of Agreement with the UP Manila Alumni Foundation Inc. (UPMAFI) for the construction of the UP College of Medicine Medical Sciences Building, in which P400 million will be raised by UPMAFI, and P70 million by the UP System Administration.

According to newly appointed College of Medicine Dean Charlotte Chiong, the new building is an impetus for more collaborative research on Philippine medical problems and a venue for medical students to obtain dual and higher, research-based degrees.

In his speech during the ground-breaking, Concepcion commended the team effort of UP Manila sectors, most especially on projects with its alumni, to benefit the people. “Bilib na bilib ang buong UP System sa pagmamalasakit ng mga alumni sa ikagagaling ng UP Manila (The whole UP System is impressed with the amount of concern the alumni have for the welfare of UP Manila),” Concepcion added. The outstanding team effort is manifested in the scale of the medical sciences building project, he said, which UP Manila expects to finish in 24 months.

Interior Design students mount expensive mock-ups for studio exhibits as an old practice for application courses. (Photo by ID 179 students)

 

In an era of soul-searching in UP in the early 1990s, the Interior Design (ID) program saw an opportunity to turn ID’s elitist image around.

It started with an insight. To Interior Design Professor Adelaida Mayo, ID should be seen in the context of basic needs. “There’s food, clothing, and shelter. Architecture deals with shelter, but where is its soul? It’s in the space people use. It’s inside. The shelter will just be the shell of it,” Mayo concluded.

Without proper interior design, that space is bound to get unwieldy. Worse, it could lead to health problems and accidents. That living space may not be livable.

Sadly, interior designers are left out in planning most low-cost and mass housing projects. Financially strapped institutions understandably omit interior designers from their roster of contractors, given their limited budgets.

Together with another professor, Raquel Florendo, Mayo ushered the new millennium in the ID program with a concept to address this gap. How about their Special Projects classes doing it?

It would be a more difficult task, a radical change from mounting exhibits of the students’ designs. But UP gladly prepared the students for such a challenge.

The move to democratize Interior Design started with student volunteers. ID 179 or the Interior Design Special Projects Class called on students to apply “the knowledge, skills and competencies acquired and developed during the first three years of extensive training in interior design (to) a special project of their choice.”

 

The lobby of the Ephpheta Foundation Institute for the Blind as improved by ID 179 students (Photo by ID 179 students)

 

For a long time, ID students worked only in the studio. This was understandable as designing actual interiors and implementing them required a license, which students could not possibly have before graduation. They were compelled to simulate interior space, staging mock-ups of walls and ceilings and floors, furnishing, decorating and then exhibiting them inside halls, all of which was expensive. But all that went to waste once their works were dismantled. The students had no idea how their designs would have held up in actual use.

In their new special project, the students would be under the close supervision of the professors, whose licenses would take care of the legal requirements for the projects.

Grouped into teams, they helped look for project sites. They consulted with and proposed designs for screening by their professors. They coordinated among themselves to unify their concepts. Making cost estimates, they then set out to raise funds and get sponsorships."
IT vs. TB – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/it-vs-tb/,"IT vs. TB
March 1, 2018 | Written by Fred Dabu



Tuberculosis has been an age-old scourge for Filipinos, killing 14,000 in 2015 (according to data from the Department of Health, while the World Health Organization’s estimate is 22,000 in 2016) and putting the Philippines fourth on the WHO list of countries with high TB incidence. Fighting it hasn’t been easy. “Superbugs” or bacteria that have become resistant to existing first-line drugs have emerged due to inappropriate use of medicines, incorrect prescription, or failure to complete the treatment program. Some anti-TB medicines also cause serious side effects.

Filipino scientists have thus been looking for newer and more effective compounds against multi-drug resistant tuberculosis or MDR-TB and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis or XDR-TB, among other superbugs.

Drug development is a long and expensive process. But in UP, computer-aided drug discovery and development (CADDD) is now helping to reduce the time and cost of drug discovery.

In 2012, a UP research team embarked on a project pioneering the use of computers in discovering new compounds for the treatment of TB. The project was supported until August 2017 by the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs (OVPAA) of the UP System under the Emerging Inter-Disciplinary Research (EIDR) program.

Out of around 5 million compounds screened virtually in the computer laboratory set up in UP Manila, the researchers were able to test around a hundred compounds, and then filter down the number of top hits to around ten active compounds, from which three were considered very promising.

 

How drug leads are discovered (from “Drug Discovery Today: Fighting TB with Technology” on SlideShare https://www.slideshare.net/rendevilla/drug-discovery-today-fighting-tb-with-technology)

 

The project has officially ended, but according to project leader Junie B. Billones, PhD, a professor in Chemistry at the Department of Physical Sciences and Mathematics of the College of Arts and Sciences (DPSM-CAS), the work goes on. The computational lab for drug discovery, including the software and computers they used, are still there for UP students and researchers to use.

This breakthrough project proved that Filipinos can perform cutting-edge drug discovery and that UP researchers can match what those in universities abroad, with more advanced facilities and equipment, are doing."

The offices of the UP Vice President for Administration and the Staff Regent led the holding of the UP System-wide Administrative Management and Staff Conference with the theme: “Serving with honor, dignity, and compassion: Reaffirming the role of administrative personnel as partners in governance” on July 11 to 14, 2018 in UP Visayas.

“Why not include honesty?” Rep. Satur Ocampo said in a keynote address. “It is the key attribute for anyone to be regarded as having honor and dignity in public service,” he pointed out.

Ocampo affirmed the value of compassion: “It may be the fundamental element that can best measure a public servant’s worth in the eyes of the people. . . and strikes the highest resonance with them.”

Hosted by UP Visayas (UPV), the conference gathered together more than 150 delegates from the management and administrative ranks of the constituent universities in the main conference venue at the College of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences of UPV’s Miagao, Iloilo campus to listen to Ocampo and other resource persons: Vice President for Administration Nestor Yunque, former Vice President for Administration Maragtas Amante, Regent Frederick Mikhail Farolan, Regent Angelo Jimenez, and Henrietta Española, MD.

With the input of the resource persons, management and staff tried to achieve a “meeting of minds” on ways to empower employees in support of University operations, strengthen the employee development program, protect employees from disasters and climate change, promote health and wellness, help employees avail of legal protection in the conduct of service; and thus, enable them to serve with honor, dignity, and compassion.

President Danilo Concepcion, UP Los Baños Chancellor Fernando Sanchez, UP Visayas Chancellor Ricardo Babaran, UP Open University Chancellor Melinda Bandalaria, UP Mindanao Chancellor Sylvia Concepcion, and UP Cebu Chancellor Liza Corro, and representatives of the rest of the chancellors were present for dialogues.

On the eve of the last day of the conference, the participants gathered in a solidarity dinner in the UPV Miagao Covered Gymnasium and presented cultural numbers by constituent university (CU). On July 14, together with the President, they were ferried from accommodations at UPV Miagao dormitories to visit the UPV Marine Biological Station in the Taklong Island National Marine Reserve off the southern coast of Guimaras for an awareness tour.

 

Ideas

Workshops and discussions between management and the staff representatives resulted in some workable ideas. Ocampo and Chancellor Concepcion spoke of the critical role of a strong labor union; and Amante, of the Collective Negotiation Agreement and the Staff Regent, of staff empowerment.

 

Conference participants await the presentations (Photo by Bong Arboleda, UP MPRO)

 

For the legal protection of employees in the performance of their duties, the creation of a claims board with tenured lawyers and alumni assistance to strengthen legal offices were two of many suggested proposals. Vulnerabilities of employees and their families could be addressed by the extension of E-HOPE to family members, the creation of Safety Officer positions and an occupational safety commission for each CU, by formulating protocol for emergencies, and by conducting regular drug checks. To reward compassion in service, an awards program was to be considered.

Yunque reported on UP’s discussions with the Civil Service Commission, the Department of Budget and Management, and the Commission on Audit on a joint circular to end contractualization among its ranks, and to be able to mitigate its impact. He cited the possibility of forming a labor cooperative, among others, to address the problem.

He also reported on the current administration being all for equal opportunities for both academic and non-academic staff in terms of staff welfare and development. The staff in turn reiterated the need to also develop personnel in preparation for the retirement of those already in office.

‘I don’t see myself at the pinnacle.’—Cristeta Comerford

Even as she occupies one of the top culinary posts in the United States, White House Executive Chef Cristeta Pasia Comerford does not consider herself at the pinnacle of her life. “I am still at a stepping stone to where life will lead me next,” she said after she was conferred a Doctor of Humane Letters, honoris causa, by the University of the Philippines on November 11."

Other units in UP Diliman have their own mascots. Name any building, and it likely has at least one feline resident. Even the Balay Tsanselor has its own non-human animal occupants. UP Diliman Chancellor Michael Tan laughingly describes inheriting ten cats who live at the Balay, whom he now takes care of along with two dogs.

UP Journalism professor Khrysta Rara, who hosts a radio show on DZUP entitled “Kwentuhang Pets, Atbp.” and who founded the animal welfare organization Friends of Campus Animals (FOCA UP), notes that the term “stray” might actually be a misnomer when it comes to UP Diliman’s non-human animal residents.

“We call them ‘stray’ cats but they’re not actually stray because they live on campus. Many are residents of each college, fed and cared for by students, staff and faculty. That’s why we call them community cats. They’re part of the community.”

Although voiceless members of the UP community, the campus animals have made a difference in people’s lives. Rara collects stories of heartwarming encounters between the animals and humans of UP Diliman—stories of students, faculty and staff feeding the animals, rescuing them, and adopting them.

Animals helping humans

In many instances, though, it is the animals who help humans. At the College of Mass Communication, students take a break from the pressures of academic life by sitting with the cats for a while. This has led Rara to dub the cats “stress-busters.” Staff at UP dormitories have shared stories of students from distant provinces whose loneliness was eased by the presence of cats. There was even a foreign student who found it hard to connect with his classmates but would spend his evenings studying with the cats for company.

The beneficial effect of pets on mental health has been widely studied, and both Rara and Tan have seen the transformative effect of having an animal companion. Rara herself shares how Kit-Kat, the famous feline matriarch at the CMC who has been featured on Howie Severino’s documentary “Pusang Gala,” comforted her during the difficult time following the passing of her mother.

Tan has also noted the effectiveness of therapy from dogs in easing the symptoms of mental illness, anxiety and stress—at least among people who like animals to begin with—which is why he is considering putting up a system of emotional support animals on campus, as is being done in universities abroad.

The campus animals also serve as companions for the staff and the security guards. Tan shares how the lady security guard assigned to the College of Science library building is particularly close to the alpha female who is the sole feline resident of the building. Sometimes, the bond between the animals and humans is so strong that the staff and security guards end up adopting the animals themselves, taking them to be vaccinated and spayed or neutered.

This is, of course, on top of the usual benefits of having animals, which is added security, pest control, and somewhat lesser known, as population control for other animals in the unit, since cats and dogs tend to be territorial and will drive away interlopers.

 

Nature abhors a vacuum

While there are benefits in having animals around, the uncontrolled population growth of animals does pose serious problems. Given that cats and dogs are territorial, putting too many of them together in one area stresses them out, which leads to fights and injuries. The humans also suffer—from poor hygiene from animal urine and feces; from the risk of the spread of diseases and parasites; and from the risk of bites and scratches. An uncontrolled population of cats and dogs also leads more people to view the animals as pests, which can lead to acts of cruelty that violate RA 8485, or The Animal Welfare Act of 1998.

Unit heads faced with an uncontrolled animal population usually resort to having the animals rounded up and taken to the pound, where at the end of a holding period, they are eventually put down.

This method, however, presents certain problems. Dr. Rey Oronan of the UP College of Veterinary Medicine Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences, who is Faculty-in-Charge of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital (VTH) in Diliman, describes it thus: “Once you remove the resident animals in an area and you transfer them to a different place, you are creating a cycle. The resident animals have been removed, so a new batch will come in. Then the place you’ve relocated the animals to will also have a problem, since the number of animals in that area has increased. The other thing is, the animals aren’t really relocated. The pound, for one, is mandated to euthanize the animals.”

“The evidence is very clear that the wrong approach is to gather the animals and exterminate them, which is still the dominant thinking,” explains Tan. “Anyone with good training in biology should know that in ecology, Nature does not like vacuums. If you want total extermination, you would have to kill all the animals and you cannot do that. Not just from a humane point of view. It’s also impossible.”

Especially not in UP Diliman, an extremely porous community with two distinct aspects. It is, first and foremost, an academic community. But where there are people, there are dogs and cats, and UP Diliman is surrounded by residential areas. The campus has around 70,000 residents by Tan’s count, and a conservative estimate of 7,000 dogs. The cats number even more than that, since dogs give birth only twice a year, while cats give birth four times a year.

There is no question that animal-lovers abound on campus. However, compassion toward our community cats and dogs must be applied with judicious knowledge of animal care.

To help control our animal population on campus and create a better environment for both humans and animals, here are some dos and don’ts of responsible pet ownership:

 

If you are a building administrator or are a student/faculty/staff member who cares for the animals in your building:

• Do not feed the cats and dogs indiscriminately. Feed them only at designated times and in a designated place a safe distance from the building. This will train the animals not to scavenge or beg for food, or otherwise make pests of themselves.

Thirty-four research projects took center stage in Saliksikhay, a two-day conference that aimed to disseminate information on UP Diliman (UPD) research as well as to inspire collaboration among UP units and partnerships between and among industry, government, and the academe. It was held from January 16 to 17 at the UPD College of Architecture Benito Sy Pow Auditorium.

Saliksikhay, the word being a combination of “saliksik” (research) and “sikhay” (zeal), clustered the projects into eight categories: education and culture; transport solutions and energy; housing and infrastructure; environmental protection; food and agriculture; disaster risk reduction and resiliency; health and wellness;, and advanced science and technology.

In his message, UPD Chancellor Michael Tan said the conference aimed to “build bridges”—to get people to talk to each other, sparking ideas and leading to new explorations.

UPD Vice Chancellor for Research and Development and now incoming Chancellor Fidel Nemenzo, whose office organized Saliksikhay, said the event expanded on Agham Bayan, a 2018 gathering that focused on scientific research. This was to show the “range of idea production” in UPD and prove that the work done in and by the University is “worthy of public support”.

Saliksikhay featured the following projects:

The sight of a wheelchair has tradition­ally evoked pity for the person sitting in it, often presumed to be powerless and incapable. But that perception is changing—as well as the reality behind it. Today, wheelchairs are seen as tools for empowerment, which could change people’s lives for the better.

United Nations statistics suggest that 10 to 15 percent of any given population may be per­sons living with disabilities (PWDs) in need of some form of assistive technology, such as a wheelchair, visual aid, hearing aid, or other devices to help them with their daily needs, activities, and mobility. Given our population of just over 100 million, there could be about 15 million Filipinos living with a disability today.

Given these figures, the supply of wheelchairs for Filipino PWDs could be far shorter than the de­mand, so the University of the Philippines has stepped in to fill the gap and raise the quality of life of PWDs.

The UP College of Allied Medical Professions (UP CAMP) in UP Manila initiated a Wheelchair Service Program for indigents in 2012 as part of its Com­munity-Based Rehabilitation Program (CBRP) and the Clinic for Therapy Services (CTS). Dr. Ferdiliza Dandah S. Garcia, a speech pathologist and a medi­cal doctor currently teaching in UP CAMP, oversees the implementation of the WSP.

Are Laguna’s hot springs losing steam? – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/are-lagunas-hot-springs-losing-steam/,"Are Laguna’s hot springs losing steam?
June 11, 2018 | Written by Fred Dabu



Researchers, mostly from the University of the Philippines, have pointed out that over-extraction of groundwater by hot spring resorts in Calamba and Los Baños in Laguna Province can cause a variety of problems, such as a drop in groundwater level and competition for water supply in the near future. Will Laguna’s hot springs also “lose steam” or cool down due to over-consumption?

 

Municipalities of Calamba and Los Baños located at the foothills of Mt. Makiling and Mt. Banahaw. (Source: Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies, Volume 11, June 2017, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2015.11.020)

 

Among the tourist attractions that Laguna is known for are its hot spring resorts and water spas sprawling in areas endowed with plenty of groundwater made warm by geothermal activities in the foothills of Mt. Makiling and Mt. Banahaw. The researchers were concerned that “the increasing number of hot spring resorts in the area and the increasing number of visitors entail greater demand for groundwater to be used in the pools,” especially during the summer months from March to May, and in December, peak periods for these business establishments.

The research team comprised Karen Ann B. Jago-on of the School of Urban and Regional Planning (SURP) in UP Diliman (UPD); Fernando P. Siringan of the Marine Science Institute (MSI) in UPD; Rosana Balangue-Tarriela of the National Institute of Geological Sciences (NIGS) in UPD; Makoto Taniguchi of the Research Institute for Humanity and Nature in Kyoto, Japan; Yvette Kirsten Reyes of SURP; Ronald Lloren of MSI; Maria Angelica Peña of NIGS; and Elenito Bagalihog of the National Water Resources Board (NWRB) of the Philippines.

In an article published in the Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies, Volume 11, June 2017, these researchers warned of over-consumption of groundwater in selected areas in Laguna for domestic, agricultural, commercial and industrial uses; and, of possible negative effects of unregulated water use on affected populations, such as conflict or competition over the use of available water.

Through their study, they are calling for improvements in the implementation of existing water use regulations and the strengthening of partnerships for the sustainable management of groundwater resources. The researchers are also asking for the crafting and implementation of specific water use regulations for hot springs. The article was one of the team’s research outputs under a bigger research project on human environmental security funded by the Research Institute for Humanity and Nature (RIHN).

Their study, “Hot spring resort development in Laguna Province, Philippines: Challenges in water use regulation,” projected the impact of the activities of hot spring resorts in Calamba, where 466 of these were registered, and in Los Baños, where 42 were registered as business establishments with their respective local government units. Only a handful of them, however, were registered with the NWRB.

In August this year, UP received amazing news. During their three-month tour in Europe, the UP Singing Ambassadors had won the Grand Prize and 17 other awards in the 66th Concorso Polifonico Internazionale “Guido d’Arrezzo,” including top prizes in four categories. The group also reaped awards in various other choir competitions in Berlin, Torrevieja, Spain, and Florence, Italy.

Not bad for a choir that started out in 1980 as a freshman dormitory choir created by its conductor Prof. Edgardo Manguiat and which evolved into one of the country’s best choirs recognized by the Consumers’ Choice Awards and the ALIW Awards Foundation. This year, the UPSA became the only Asian choir to win the Grand Prize at Arezzo twice, the first time being in 2001. With this win, UPSA is qualified to compete in the prestigious European Grand Prix for Choral Singing in 2019.

Media described UPSA’s triumph as a “grand slam.” Yet on another level, it was also par for the course for UP’s choral groups in light of how UP has influenced the growth of Philippine choral music since the mid-20th century.

 

Watch “Kilometro” (Choral Cover) by the UP Singing Ambassadors

 

Philippine choral singing is a product of three forces: colonization, Christianization, and Westernization. In churches, singing was part of the liturgy, while schools, which were run by religious orders, also included group singing in the curriculum. The American period saw the development of secular choral music, and before and after World War II, choral groups of Protestant churches dominated Philippine choral singing. In the early 20th century, nationalistic compositions also emerged in the form of hymns.

Nevertheless, most choral pieces were pieces brought here from Europe and the US, as well as Catholic church music, with arrangements by some Filipino composers including UP College of Music alumni such as Nicanor Abelardo, Rodolfo Cornejo, Lucio San Pedro, and Ramon Tapales. According to Prof. Andrea Veneracion, National Artist for Music, there were only about a dozen or so original Filipino choral works around the time she founded the Madrigal Singers.

 

From the UP Mixed Chorus to the Korus

The 1960s was a turning point for Philippine choral music. In 1962, the UP Mixed Chorus was named the UP System’s official choir by then UP President Carlos P. Romulo. The UP Mixed Chorus participated in the musical extravaganza that marked President Romulo’s inauguration in 1963. During the gala concert, Eliseo M. Pajaro conducted his Prelude and Testament with Aurelio Estanislao as baritone soloist and the UP Mixed Chorus singing in the choral fugue.

The UP Mixed Chorus was originally conducted by UP College of Music Dean Ramon Tapales. Dean Rey T. Paguio succeeded him in 1969 while Prof. Janet “Jai” Sabas-Aracama took over in 1999. It became the UP Concert Chorus or simply the “Korus”. The UPCC is famous for pioneering Choreo Capella or choreographed a capella singing in the Philippines.

The Korus has been named one of the world’s best choirs, has performed in full-length ballets, operatic works, popular films, TV specials and pop concerts. It has won international competitions in Spain, Hungary and Finland, and was given the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Aliw Awards Foundation in 2012, and the National Commission on Culture and the Arts’ Ani ng Dangal award in 2013.

The Philippine Madrigal Singers

In 1963, another choir made its debut at the Abelardo Hall Auditorium under Veneracion’s leadership. It was a small group consisting of UP College of Music faculty and students that she had organized to sing madrigals during lunch breaks. The group introduced a new concept in performance—sitting in a semi-circle, with Veneracion, their conductor, seated with them instead of standing in front.

The group, known as the UP Madrigal Singers or simply “the Madz”, soon became one of the world’s most awarded choirs, attaining near legendary status for its virtuosity, versatility and vast repertoire. In 1980, the Cultural Center of the Philippines appointed the Madz as its resident artist in choral music, prompting the UP Madz to change its name to the Philippine Madrigal Singers in light of its national recognition.

Taxicabs have long been the boon and bane of the urban commuter’s existence. And the public sector can only do so much to address the bane. Nurtured by UP’s incubation program, a start-up company is rising to the occasion.

In the UP Cebu Business Incubation for IT (UPCeBuInIT), Micab has found a home since January 2015. Even before the Grab issue, Micab had already been pioneering this kind of service in Cebu. As a start-up, it zeroed in on the much-maligned taxicab service, to give commuters an alternative to old-school taxicab fleet management and hailing.

In 2012, it pioneered SMS-based taxicab hailing; by 2013, it was a working data-based app. But only when it was taken on by UP Cebu in January 2015 was it able to have staff that would run and continually upgrade the service full-time, with active customer support for its growing number of clients.

Now Micab is known as an Internet-based taxicab hailing application, introduced into the national consciousness in the wake Grab’s takeover of the country’s TNVS (transport network vehicle service) private fleets.

“Instead of getting fleets from the private sector, we provide the taxis a system by which the fleets are managed and monitored. At the same time, the riding public can get taxis through the app,” Micab Chief Technology Officer Kenneth Baylosis summarizes the system.

 

Taxicab 2.0

Now, according to Baylosis, the Micab app has conquered 50 percent of Cebu’s taxicab fleets or around 3,000 taxicab units. It is now powering over 2,000 taxicab users in Manila, 700 in Iloilo, and 500 in Baguio. It is being introduced in Bacolod, Davao, and Cagayan de Oro. Its share of the market qualifies it as a major app provider, even as it struggles to meet demand nationally.

Labeled Taxicab 2.0, this has improved the taxicab experience, through the app that has worked out kinks in its early operations and that continuously learns from its partnerships. Baylosis said that Micab embodies the aspiration for modern and professional taxicabs.

The app chooses units to power. The Micab app runs on units that meet standards, certifications, and clearances set by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB). These include adoption of modern amenities such as GPS, and the use of units not older than four years. Micab thus partners with highly recognized operators, such as Ken and Yoo in Cebu.

“In the app, you can see the complete driver’s profile,” Baylosis adds. “And we are training the drivers, who must of course have undergone regular health and drug checks.”

“We began with a difficult situation—a taxicab industry that was very old school in terms of doing business and bad habits already formed. We’re trying to shake those habits out through technology. We’re using technology to change the culture,” he says.

“For example, we have a points system to dissuade the drivers from choosing clients. If you accept clients and reach quota, you get incentives. We’re now working to ‘gamify’ the incentives for the drivers’ side,” Baylosis continues.

There’s nothing more culturally devastating than having traditions slowly fade from practice into the dark corners of memory. Music, especially its forms deeply rooted in specific events and experiences, belongs to those traditions. This is why the UP Center for Ethnomusicology is such a high-value cultural resource.

The center started out as the UP Ethnomusicology Archives in 1997, when the University Board of Regents recognized the groundbreaking work and authorship of National Artist for Music Jose Maceda. He put together the center’s core collection: an ethnomusicological treasure of around 2,500 hours of recordings, field notes, musical instruments, transcriptions, song texts, photographs, and compositions, among many others, as well as roughly 2,000 books and journals.

In 2007, that collection was recognized as documentary heritage and inscribed in the UNESCO Memory of the World Register.

The change in name signaled the evolution of the center from archival work and digitization of its collection to conducting its own research, linking up with similar institutions, and pursuing multidisciplinary initiatives. It has ethnomusicological materials from the Philippines, Southeast Asia, and representative areas from different continents.

It currently has four facilities: a library, archives, an instrumentarium, and an audio conservation laboratory.

One of its biggest projects was Laon Laon, the brainchild of former Executive Director Ramon Santos, who was later named National Artist for Music. Laon Laon was a venue for music research centers across Asia to come together in pursuit of preserving and sustaining music amid the changes brought by modernization."

The Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra (PPO) and UP choral groups gave the public an evening of symphonic and choral music with solos from a premier tenor and mezzo soprano, presented in a free and live concert, on December 8, 2018, in the Quezon Hall Amphitheater in UP Diliman.

Performing with the historic Quezon Hall as backdrop and in a full open-air amphitheater, the ensemble delighted the crowd with a mix of carols, classical and modern selections, including symphonic arrangements for 2015 and 2016 popular hits and Beyonce music.

A set was devoted to international and local Christmas-themed songs, which the crowd was invited to join. The concert culminated in the Hallelujah Chorus of Handel’s “Messiah” and Nicanor Abelardo’s “UP Naming Mahal”.

Maestro Herminigildo Ranera conducted the ensemble composed of the PPO and 130 voices provided by the UP Cherubim and Seraphim, the UP Concert Chorus, the UP Singing Ambassadors, the UP Staff Chorale, and UP chorus classes. Solos were performed by mezzo soprano Janet Sabas-Aracama and tenor Ramon Acoymo, who also provided the concert spiels.

The intermission was highlighted by a surprise parade of UP athletes, for whom tribute songs were sung by Acoymo and the crowd. The amphitheater became a sea of waving lights as the crowd lit up their mobile phone flashlights and cheered the athletes.

Titled “Pamaskong Handog ng UP”, the concert was offered free to the public through the cooperation of the UP System and the Cultural Center of the Philippines. This was the third time in 2018 the PPO played in a free and live concert in UP. “Pamaskong Handog” was the first time, however, for the PPO to accompany UP groups.

The PPO played in the Philippine General Hospital and UP Diliman under its outreach program in which it gives free performances to the public with the help of hosting partners. Acoymo has served as coordinator in the past two UP concerts. (Jo. Lontoc, UP MPRO)

UP is a musical hub, as it is a leader in culture and the arts with its many scholar artists, national artists, and bright young talents. But not resting on its laurels, it also invites and attracts world-class musicians, exposing the public to the best, and inspiring UP’s own.

UP recently forged partnerships with the Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra (PPO), the resident orchestra of the Cultural Center of the Philippines, which is regarded as one of the top musical ensembles in the Asia-Pacific region. With the University as host, it has brought live symphonic music to the public for free.

A collaboration early this year resulted in a public performance that exceeded expectations. The concert “Simulain at Pangarap” rivaled the UP Diliman Lantern Parade and general commencement exercises in audience size. The live concert on March 23, 2018 was one of the few instances in which the UP Quezon Hall Amphitheater was filled with people for an evening of symphonic orchestral music under the moon and stars.

“Seeing people here is heartening,” UP Diliman Chancellor Michael Tan said in his welcome remarks. “The turnout tells us people will come,” he added.

“Your presence is most important,” Tan then told PPO. “It is bringing music to the communities and not keeping it within the Cultural Center.”

The concert began with PPO’s version of “Lupang Hinirang” just after sunset. It ended with Professor Ramon Acoymo, the program coordinator for UP, singing “UP Naming Mahal”. The crowd applauded the classics “Overture to Gillaume Tell” and “Waves of the Danube Waltz” just as warmly as it did selections from the modern-day musicals Les Miserables and Phantom of the Opera. Symphonic music roused all ages familiar with the Indiana Jones and Star Wars themes, and Aegis, Itchyworms, and APO Hiking Society tunes. The familiar “Three Coins in the Fountain”, “Despacito”, and “Baby Shark” were similarly played for the crowd’s entertainment.

Many hope that UP’s partnerships with PPO will lead to UP’s establishing its own symphony orchestra. UP has a number of in-house instrumental ensembles, including the UP Symphonic Band, and a UP Orchestra which played side by side the UST Symphony Orchestra in the “No Match” concert in February 2015. The concert featured Herminigildo Ranera, conductor of UST and PPO, and UP’s own Edna Marcil Martinez.

Ranera, in an interview with UP Forum during the press conference in August 2018 for the PPO’s 45th anniversary and 36th concert season, said he envisions more collaboration between UP and the PPO.

You’ll recognize it from Giuseppe Tornatore’s film, Cinema Paradiso. It’s the UP Visayas (UPV) Cinematheque in the Iloilo City campus.

It currently houses the 77-seater Cinema Exmundo, and a film museum which are open to the public.

“It’s not big like UP Diliman’s Film Center but also not as small as its Videotheque. It’s our own little intimate film theater,” said Prof. Martin Genodepa, Special Assistant to the Chancellor for Culture and the Arts and former Cinematheque faculty-in-charge (FIC). It has that old movie house feel, emphasized by refurbished seats salvaged from Allegro Theater, one of the city’s “vintage” cinemas.

Flash back: The origins

Funded by UP alumni, the Cinematheque was launched in 2008 as a UP Centennial project and inaugurated in December 2009. It later closed for repairs to the leaking roof and reopened when the work was done.

Cinema Exmundo is named after alumni donors Solomon Exmundo and Nilda Lopez-Exmundo, who, along with their son Oliver, furnished the Cinematheque’s interior. Genodepa said the Exmundos are film lovers and wanted to share that love with the UPV community. Prof. Alfredo Diaz, the present FIC, added that Cinema Paradiso is the donors’ favorite movie, which not only explains the building’s design but also the sharing of their passion for cinema.

But the Exmundos are not the only alumni responsible for the existence of the Cinematheque. Former Antique Governor Salvacion Zaldivar-Perez is also instrumental in the sourcing of funds for the P3-million building.

Now showing: a gathering place

Diaz told the UP Forum that Cinema Exmundo not only screens classic and independent feature films and documentaries, but is also a venue for lectures. It naturally beckons film enthusiasts in and out of UPV to come together, enjoy movies, and listen to film scholars and practitioners.

The engagement of the UPV community has improved, he said. “I’m happy that students have become very active in acquiring rights to movies that they want to be shown here. And if they’re screening it for free, we don’t charge them.” He explained that in the beginning, deciding on the films to be featured fell on the management’s shoulders."

Compassion, Our Common Ground

Investiture Speech of

Danilo L. Concepción

21st President, University of the Philippines

20 September 2017, 5:00 p.m., University Theater

 

I stand before you today as a student trained in two disciplines: that of science, which taught me the measure of Nature, and that of the law, which taught me the measure of Man. I cannot claim that I have learned enough because education is a lifelong process, and I expect to live a little longer. But this I have surely come to realize: that while Nature may be bewilderingly complex, Man is infinitely more so.

If I had remained an agricultural engineer, I might have been happy designing new tools for farming or more effective irrigation systems. But ultimately, I found law more challenging, that which is the calibration and codification of human and social behavior.

And as if that were not enough, and even before UP, I took on teaching and university administration—which, in a strange but logical way, draw on all these threads of thought and experience to form a coherent wholeness of purpose.

Indeed the university is probably the one institution in society—with the possible exception of Congress—where diversity and difference are its very nature and intrinsic to its success.

Today, with nearly 200 undergraduate and almost 350 graduate programs, UP can proudly claim to offer the broadest canopy under which Filipino students and scholars can learn. Nowhere else in this country can you take such diverse courses as Archeology, Geomatics Engineering, Tropical Landscape Architecture, and Women and Development.

That is what a national university is for, and that is why UP is one. We recognize that a national university exists not to profit the pocket, but to enrich the mind and to enlarge the soul of our people. We stand firm in the belief that all forms of knowledge benefit humanity, and that part of our mission is to employ that knowledge for social transformation.

At his investiture in 1911, our first President, Dr. Murray Bartlett, made it clear that the new University of the Philippines was not merely going to be a copy of its models in the West but would be a “University for Filipinos” devoted to providing “the intellectual and moral leadership essential to social salvation and progressive national development.”

It seems ironic today—given our much-vaunted nationalism and secularism—to remark that Dr. Bartlett was an American and a Protestant pastor. But that irony offers vivid proof that our founders understood that creating a great university would mean stepping out of one’s own moorings into a true community of minds.

And so, difference and diversity have been with us since the beginning—and of course, dissension and debate, especially since the University Council was first set up. But again, and notably, we have managed to harmonize our differences over more than a century of discourse to forge a way forward—whether it be in terms of crafting a curriculum for general education, or rewarding performance and productivity.

Therein lies our University’s vitality—not in the fact that we argue, because argue we must, but in the fact that we have always managed at some point to agree, because agree we also must.

Dissent has been coded into our DNA, the most familiar expression of the critical thinking we have sought to imbue every UP student with. But we also know that between academic inquiry and practical necessity lies much common ground to explore and to inhabit.

On June 8, 1933, students at the College of Education boycotted their classes in the first protest ever against a tuition fee increase, from P30 to P50 per semester. Among the leaders of the mass action was none other than Fe Palma, daughter of then UP President Rafael Palma. History does not record what President Palma said to his daughter afterwards, but I suppose he should have been proud, as she was a product of the liberal education that he himself espoused in his inaugural address.

Four years later in 1937, when President Quezon pushed for the transfer of UP from Padre Faura to Diliman, UP students led by a young editor named Armando Malay held a straw vote that resoundingly rejected the move by 84 percent.

The critics complained that Diliman was a dark and mountainous territory teeming with snakes, monkeys, and mosquitoes. Then UP President Bienvenido Gonzalez was crucified. But twelve years later, when the move had finally happened, Malay spoke again, but this time in Diliman, and acknowledged that it was time “for a closing of the ranks.”

These instances of dissent were classically and uniquely UP. We ourselves have made this possible, empowering and emboldening generations of students with reason, enabling them, as Palma put it, “to react properly to the promptings of truth and to the world.” We—and perhaps we alone—have justly and proudly held reason above all other considerations in our academic life: considerations such as creed, kinship, privilege, authority.

And it is this supremely valuable faculty to which I appeal today, as I grasp the helm of this great enterprise we call the University of the Philippines. Let reason guide us, but not reason alone; let it be reason tempered with respect, responsibility, and collegiality.

Both at the national and university levels, it is becoming difficult to push any agenda forward without being subjected to intense, sometimes malicious, but also often necessary scrutiny. In many instances, we have stopped talking to one another as a people sharing the same future.

Truth, reason, and respect have been the prime casualties in these exchanges, which I am sure you have witnessed—if not participated in—online. The phrase “social media” has almost become an oxymoron, as it has become the stalking ground of some of the most unsociable people you could come across.

Sad to say, some of that caustic and deeply divisive rhetoric has come to infect our University, not just our students but our faculty, staff, and administrators as well. This is perhaps to be expected, as a university remains, in many ways, merely a microcosm of a much larger society.

Our strength lies in our collegiality. If we allow our reason and our rhetoric to be clouded by intolerance, then we will be no more and no better than a gang, indeed than any other collection of ill-tempered individuals.

At his investiture in 1975, another of my predecessors, President Onofre D. Corpuz, openly took issue with the University’s characterization as “a battleground of ideas,” calling it a “romantic notion” that the people could ill afford to pay for with their taxes.

Rather than a battleground, I prefer to focus on finding, in this University, a common ground, a clearing—a safe, free, and congenial space within which its constituents can teach, study, and work productively to their full potential.

UP must be that special place within which it should still be possible—despite all divisions and distractions—to work together with the University’s and the nation’s strategic interests in mind.

For this we must promote consensus over conflict, civility over calumny, and collaboration over confrontation. We must foster strategic thinking over short-sightedness, honest labor over opportunism, and shared effort over self-promotion.

There should be no better place in this country than UP for the expression of ideas without fear, without fear of violent retribution from one’s colleagues or from the State itself. There should be no environment more welcoming than UP for cutting-edge research, timely policy studies, exciting new exhibits and productions, and provocative art and literature—in other words, the work we have always meant to do, and do best.

We will be guided by the overarching vision of UP as a leading regional and global university in an environment that sustains 21st century learning, knowledge creation, and public service for society and humanity.

Where our University is situated today would not have been possible without the foundations laid by my esteemed predecessors, whom I acknowledge and thank today, and to whom I make a personal pledge to do my best to live up to their example. President Edgardo Angara, who was not able to make it today, Presidents Emanuel Soriano, Emil Javier, Jose Abueva, Francisco Nemenzo, Emerlinda Roman, and Alfredo Pascual—sa inyo pong lahat, tanggapin ninyo ang aming taos pusong pasasalamat, paggalang, at pagpupugay!

Bunsod ng ating hangaring ituloy ang mga mahahalaga at makabuluhang pagbabago, at sa paniniwalang mayroon tayong maia-ambag sa hangaring ito, ini-alay po natin ang ating sarili upang maglingkod bilang Pangulo. Nagsama-sama po tayo sa ating pakay at galaw, at dahil dito, tayo po ay nanaig at nagtagumpay.

Ngayon, ang tagumpay na ito ang simula ng ating pagkilos upang patunayan sa lahat na ang mga pangarap at adhikain na sinampalatayaan at pinanghawakan ng ating mga kasama, kakampi man o katunggali, ay kaya nating maisakatuparan at makamtan. Lahat po ng ating balak at panukala ay matutupad at matatapos kung tayo po ay magsa-sama-samang muli sa pagpaplano, pagpapasya, at pagpapapatupad sa lahat ng ating gagawin para sa pagsusulong ng minimithing pagbabago.

Upang tayo ay magtagumpay, ang tatlong sangkap ng ating Unibersidad: ang mga mag-aaral, ang kaguruan, at ang mga kawani, ay dapat na magkabigkis-bigkis tungo sa isang layunin. Nasa pagkakaisa nating lahat lamang ang susi ng tagumpay. Totoo, ang pagkakaisa ay tunay na mailap at mahirap makamit sapagkat lubhang maraming pagkakaiba ang ating mga pangangailangan, paniniwala, at pamantayan. Subalit tayo ay nananalig na mayroong isang tagpuan kung saan lahat tayo ay maaring tumayong sama-sama na parang isang katawan. Bilang isang katawan, tiyak nating mapagtatanto at madarama na ang sakit ng kalingkingan ay sakit ng buong katawan. Ang sakit na iniinda ng sinuman sa atin, ay sakit na iindahin ng lahat natin. Hindi natin marahil napapansin subalit ang tagpuang ito ay nasa mga puso na natin. Kailangan lamang po nating itong mapagtanto at madama.

At upang tayo ay manatiling magkakayakap sa ating tagpuan, tayo po bilang Pangulo, ang magsisilbing isang pagkit na sa ating lahat ay hahatak at magdi-dikit upang wala ni-isa man sa atin ang mawalay o malisya.

Tayo po ay nakalaang makinig kanino man upang malaman ang inyong mga loobin, balak, at pangangailangan upang tayo po ay magabayan sa ating pag-ugit. Sa atin pong pamumuno, mas mahalaga ang kagalingan ng lahat kaysa sa ating personal na pananaw o kagustuhan.

Sa ating pagpapasya sa mga hakbang na ating tatahakin, ang ating gabay at panuntunan ay pagmamalasakit. Pagmamalasakit sa ating Unibersidad, pagmamalasakit sa ating mga propesyon, pagmamalasakit sa ating mga sarili, at pagmamalasakit sa isa’t isa. Kung tayo po ay nagmamalasakit, tayo ay lubos na nag-iingat; nag-iingat na ang ating bawat kilos at galaw ay hindi makasasakit o makasasama sa bawat isa sa atin.

Kung pagkakaisa ang susi sa tagumpay ng ating mga mithiin, pagmamalasakit naman ang susi tungo sa isang samahang wagas at pangmatagalan.

Sa susunod na anim na taon na ating hahawakan ang timon, ito po ay ating hahawakan nang mahigpit at maingat sapagkat maraming hamon at balakid ang ating haharapin, bubunuin, at gagapiin. Sa simula pa lamang ng ating pag-ugit, isang malaking hamon ang agad ay sumalubong sa atin: ang libreng matrikula sa kolehiyo.

Tunay po na ito ay isang malaking hamon sapagkat animnapung porsyento ng ating koleksyon mula sa matrikula ay nakalaan para sa ating mga faculty development programs. Kung hindi po ibibigay sa atin ng national government ang katumbas ng dapat ay ating koleksyon, wala po tayong malilikom na pondo na sadyang ilalaan sa mga programang magpapaunlad sa katayuan ng ating kaguruan.

Bukod dito, bagama’t totoong libre na nga ang tuition sa UP, makapasa naman kaya sa UPCAT ang mga kapus-palad na kabataan na sa UP ay nais makapag-aral?

Wala pong saysay at kabuluhan ang programang libreng matrikula kung sa UPCAT ang estudyante ay di naman papasa. Sa mga nakalipas na pagsasaliksik at pag-aaral, napag-alaman na maliit na bahagi lamang ng mga nagtatapos sa maraming public high schools sa labas ng Metro Manila ang pumapasa sa UPCAT. Ang sinisisi pong dahilan ay ang mababang kalidad ng pagtuturo sa mga public high schools na ito.

Dahil dito, panukala po natin na gawing kondisyon sa pagtanggap sa isang estudyante ang pagbibigay ng balik-serbisyo sa ating bayan; balik-serbisyong isang taon pagkaraang makatapos ang estudyante sa kanyang kurso. Sa loob nang isang taon, siya po ay ating pagtuturuin sa senior high school sa mga public schools na ito upang kahit-manawari ay tumaas ang kalidad ng kanilang edukasyon.

Ang kondisyong balik-serbisyo ay hindi naman po sapilitan. Malaya po ang estudyante na hindi magbalik-serbisyo, dangan siya po sa halip ay magbabayad ng matrikula kung siya po ay tatanggi bago makatapos, o ang buong halaga ng kanyang edukasyon kung siya ay tatanggi kapag siya ay nakapagtapos na. Hindi rin po libre ang pag-babalik-serbisyo. May bayad po sila habang sila ay nagtuturo.

Ganoon pa man, tayo po ay lubos na umaasa na magbabalik-serbisyo ang ating mga iskolar ng bayan. Ito na po ang kanilang pagkakataon na isabuhay ang kanilang isinisigaw na pagmamahal sa bayan. Ito na po ang pagkakataon na patunayan nila sa kanilang mga sarili ang panawagan nilang maglingkod sa kapus-palad nating mga kababayan.

Madalas pong magmartsa ang ating mga estudyante, sumisigaw ng pagbabago. Kung ating pong wawariin, parang wala nang katapusan ang kanilang mga reklamo at kahilingan; parang ibig nilang sila na ang magpalakad sa ating Unibersidad, at sila ay mag-aral nang sang-ayon tangi sa kanilang pasya at kagustuhan.

Subalit sinasabi natin ngayon sa kanila, na hinding-hindi natin sila pipigilan sa kanilang pagpapahayag ng kanilang mga kaisipan at paniniwala; hinding hindi natin sila bubusalan sa kanilang mga hinaing. Bagkus, sila ay ating pakikinggan, uunawain, at gagabayan. Hindi po natin hinuhubog ang ating mga estudyante sa isang hulmahan. Hinuhubog po natin sila upang magkaroon ng isang malaya, mapanuri, mapagtanong, at malikhaing pag-iisip; upang sila ay magtaglay ng diwang walang takot, ng tinig na hindi pasusupil; at upang sila ay manindigan para sa katwiran at katarungan.

Sa ating kaguruan, ang lakas natin ay nasa ating kakayahang mag-talo at magpasya bilang isang kalipunan. Ang kakayahang ito ay ating itataguyod at pag-iibayuhin nang marubdob.

Pagsisikapan nating malikom ang pondong kailangan ng ating faculty development programs upang hindi maputol ang mga programang nasimulan na, at upang madagdagan pa.

At upang manatili sa Unibersidad ang ating mahuhusay na kaguruan, pag-aaralan po natin na luwagan ang mga regulasyon sa tenure at promotion upang ang mga ito ay maging mas patas at mas makatarungan. Marapat din na sila ay bigyan natin ng magandang working condition, at masaya at masiglang buhay-akademiko sa ating mga campus.

Titiyakin po natin na maitayo muli ang nasunog na Facuty Center sa loob ng 3 taon. Ang bagong Faculty Center po na ito ay magiging mas malaki, mas moderno, at mas faculty-friendly.

Ang ating pong kaguruan ay binibigyan ng lipunan ng pinakamataas na pagkilala at paggalang habang sila ay nagtuturo sa ating Unibersidad. Hindi po natin papayagan na sila ay mawalan ng dignidad matapos na sila ay magretiro sa pagtuturo. Marahil, dapat tayong magtayo ng isang opisina na walang gagawin kung hindi ihanda ang ating kaguruan para sa kanilang pag-reretiro, at upang sila ay gabayan at tulungan sa kanilang mga pangangailangan, lalong-lalo na sa usapin ng pabahay.

Nakalista po sa ating priority projects ang pagpapaganda sa ating mga campuses. Nangangailangan na po ng rehabilitasyon ang ating mga gusali at mga dormitoryo. Dapat na po nating wakasan ang masakit na biro na walang malinis at mabangong CR dito sa UP.

Tayo po ay nananawagan sa ating mga alumni na sana tayo ay tulungan at damayan sa krusadang ito. Sa mga matagumpay nating alumni na tumira at nakinabang sa murang bayad sa ating mga dormitoryo, sana’y masumpungan nila sa kanilang mga puso ang magsukli at tumulong sa ating pagbabangong-anyo.

Pagsisikapan din po nating magtayo ng pangalawang Philippine General Hospital dito sa UP Diliman. Kasama po sa itatayo ang kakambal nitong College of Medicine at Genomic Cancer Research Institute. Ang medical complex po na ito ay magbibigay-serbisyo sa komunidad ng UP Diliman at ng hilagang Metro-Manila. Ang College of Medicine ay magdaragdag ng mga duktor sa ating bansa at ang Institute po naman ay tutuklas ng lunas sa cancer gamit ang makabagong siyensya ng genomics.

Pangarap po natin na ang PGH na ito ay maging pinaka moderno at pinaka magandang ospital sa buong bansa. Naniniwala po tayo na kaya nating isakatuparan ang pangarap na ito sa tulong ninyong lahat at ng lokal at pambansang pamahalaan.

Para naman po sa ating mga kawani, sinimulan na po natin ang proseso upang gawing regular ang mga kawaning matatagal na sa serbisyo. Sapagkat mangangailangan ito ng mga karagdang plantilla positions, ang proceso po ay inaasahan nating magtatagal. Subalit habang tayo po ay naghihintay,   itataas na po natin ang mga non-UP contractuals, yaong matatagal na po sa serbisyo, sa antas ng UP Contractuals upang sila ay tumanggap na ng lahat ng benepisyo ng isang regular na empleyado. Ganoon pa man, inaasahan natin na ang mga kawani ay magmamalasakit din para sa kapakanan ng ating Unibersidad. Huwag sana nilang igiit ang kanilang mga kahilingan kung ito ay hindi kayang pasanin ng ating kabang-yaman.

Kasabay nito, kailangan po nating suriing mabuti ang pangangailangan ng ating operasyon upang ang laki ng ating administrative workforce ay maging tugma rito, at hindi tuluyang lumobo. Ang salop na umaapaw ay di na po dapat dagdagan.

Sa ibabaw po ng lahat nang ito, i-aangkas natin ang ating mga reporma sa ating procurement system, sa automation ng ating mga operating systems, at sa paggamit ng ating mga pondo at resources.

Tayo po sa ngayon ang nag-iisang Pambansang Unibersidad. Subalit ang karangalan pong ito ay may kaakibat na tungkulin para sa mga unibersidad at kolehiyo sa buong bansa, pribado man o pambupliko. Sa ilalim po ng ating pagmamasid, itataguyod natin ang tambalan ng UP sa mga unibersidad at kolehiyo na ibig makipagtulungan sa ating mga gawaing akademiko at pananaliksik. Pag-aaralan po natin ang pagbalangkas sa isang facility-sharing scheme para sa ating mga SUCs.

Dumako naman po tayo sa usaping informal settlers. Lingid sa karamihan, ang pamilya po natin, minsan, ay naging informal settler din. Kung kaya po damang-dama rin natin ang nararamdaman ng ating mga kababayang nakikitirik sa ating mga lupain. Bibigyan po natin ng tamang pansin ang kanilang kapakanan. Ang kanilang kagalingan ay lagi po nating ilalahok sa lahat ng balak at pagpa-plano sa pagsasa-ayos ng ating mga campus. Hindi po tayo gigiba ng bahay kung ito ay gigiba ng buhay. Ang tanging dasal po natin, sana’y magmalasakit din naman sila sa ating Unibersidad at sa ating komunidad.

Hindi po natin ikinahiya kailanman na tayo ay galing din sa hirap. Dala po ng kahirapan sa buhay tayo po ay nangailangang tumulong sa ating mga magulang sa pagtataguyod sa pamilya. Tumulong po tayo na magpa-aral sa ating mga kapatid upang magbago ang kanilang mga kapalaran at ng ating mga mahal sa buhay. Sa ating pagtulong, nangailangan pong humingi tayo ng awa sa Panginoon. At upang patunayan na ang ating panalangin ay taimtim, tayo po ay nagbitaw ng isang panata. Panata na tayo po ay hindi hahanap ng kabiyak sa buhay hanggat hindi natatapos ng kolehiyo ang lahat ng ating mga kapatid. Dininig po ng Maykapal ang ating panalangin at malugod naman po nating tinupad ang ating panata. Hindi po tayo nakipag-isang dibdib kay Atty. Gaby hanggat hindi po tapos ng medisina ang bunso nating kapatid.

Ngayong hapon, saksi kayong lahat at ang Dakilang Lumikha, tayo po ay gumagawa muli ng isang panata. Panata na tayo po ay maglilingkod ng wagas, sa sukdulan ng ating kakayahan, nang patas at makatarungan, nang buong puso at pagmamahal, nang walang iwanan at laglagan, at higit sa lahat, na walang halong biro!

Maraming salamat po sa inyong lahat!

Mabuhay and Unibersidad ng Pilipinas!

 

 

(The English translation of the Filipino portion follows below.)

 

Driven by the sincerest and noblest desire to continue accomplishing meaningful and necessary changes in the University, and with the firm belief that I could contribute to achieve this dream, I humbly offered myself to serve our University as its President. And because we were brought and bound together by our common selfless intentions and pursuits, we prevailed, we succeeded.

This success signals the beginning of the more important task of proving to our colleagues—friends and detractors alike—and to those who rely on and believe in us that we will fulfill and deliver the reforms we have committed to achieve. This we will realize through a renewal of our collective and united efforts to plan, decide, and act toward the needed change we have envisioned together.

For us to triumph, the three vital components of our University—the students, the faculty, and the administrative staff—should aim as one to hit our targets. Our unity is the key to our success. True, unity is elusive because we fully acknowledge and accept the complexity and diversity of our respective needs, beliefs, and standards. However, we believe that there is a common ground where all of the three components can stand together as one body. We have to act as one body, so that pain endured by one of us will be pain felt by all of us. That common ground is right here in our hearts; we simply have to feel it to realize it.

To ensure that all of us will stay in that common ground together as one, I, as your President, shall act as the adhesive that will keep us fastened and bound together, so that no one will fall out, or be left out.

I am committed to listen to anyone who needs my attention, so I would know what he or she feels, plans, and needs in order to guide me in my work. Under my leadership, the common good is far more important than my personal views or desire.

The road to change is treacherous to say the least. But to guide us in every step of the way, compassion is what shall set our bearings. It is compassion when we feel genuine care for our University, genuine care for our professions, genuine care for ourselves, and genuine care for each other. When we genuinely feel compassion, we are truly careful with our words and deeds; very careful of our every move so as not to hurt or harm the things we value and care for.

If our unity is the key to our success, compassion is the key to our solidarity and lasting camaraderie.

In the next six years that I will steer the helm of this administration, rest assured that I will hold it firmly and with vigilance, for there will be great obstacles ahead to confront and overcome. Just at the start of my term as President, we already met a major challenge: tuition-free college education.

It is a major concern because we have been allocating sixty percent of our collection from tuition fees for faculty development programs. If the national government will not replace the tuition collection we will forego, there will be no funds to finance the programs that develop and uplift the conditions of our faculty.

Apart from this, we have to address another concern. While studying in UP may be free, can the students belonging to the less-privileged and marginalized families pass the UPCAT if they intend or wish to study in UP?

The free-tuition program will clearly be pointless, senseless, and useless if the students from poor families will not pass the UPCAT. Based on previous studies, only a small percentage of graduates from public high schools outside Metro Manila pass the UPCAT. This low turnout is being blamed on the low quality of instruction in those public high schools.

This reality has given rise to our proposal to impose return service as a condition for the admission of students to UP. This return service will be for one year after graduation. Our graduates will be required to teach senior high school students in public high schools that we will identify as UP feeder schools. This scheme, we hope, will uplift the quality of the graduates from these feeder schools.

The return-service condition, however, will be voluntary. Any student may opt out from this condition before graduation by paying his tuition, or the cost of his education if he will opt out after graduation. The return service to be rendered by our graduates will not be for free. Our students who will decide to teach will be compensated properly.

While it is voluntary, we are very optimistic that our students, the scholars of the nation, will choose to render return service. That is because it will be a perfect opportunity for them to live out their professed love for our country, and their advocacy to serve our poor countrymen.

Our students often march on the streets to demand change. Sometimes it seems that their clamors and complaints will never end; that they want to run the University themselves; and that they wish to study as they please or solely what they desire.

Nevertheless, we shall guarantee their right and freedom to express their ideas, beliefs, and principles. We will never even attempt to suppress what they want to say, or oppress them for what they fight for. Instead, we shall listen to them, understand them, and guide them. We do not mold them to think one way or another. On the contrary, we mold them to think freely; to develop inquisitive, discerning, and creative minds; to be fearless and assertive; and to uphold what is right and just.

For our faculty, our strength lies in our ability to discourse and resolve our differences collegially. We will value and nurture this ability intensely. We will vigorously pursue and secure the funding needed to continue and improve our faculty development programs.

In order to retain our valued faculty in our University, we will study how to ease the rules on tenure and promotion to make them fair and just. We will also upgrade their working conditions and provide them with a happy and vibrant academic life in our campuses. After it burned down last year, a bigger, more modern, and faculty-friendly Faculty Center will rise up again in three years."

UP President Danilo Concepcion visited UP Visayas (UPV) on July 13 and 14, 2018, consulting with administrative personnel representatives of the UP System, inaugurating new UPV structures, and checking on the remote UPV Marine Biological Station on Taklong Island, Guimaras.

Concepcion attended the second day of the triennial UP System-wide Administrative Management and Staff Conference held in the UPV College of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences Auditorium in the UPV Miag-ao campus, where he listened and reacted to the reporting of workshop output on administrative staff concerns.

He spoke of his favoring administrative staff directorship of administrative offices. He endorsed equal opportunity for research and free studies for the administrative staff, but urged them to initiate the proposals. He also expressed support for automatic promotion for those qualified, and for raising University revenues to be able to buy land for faculty and staff housing.

He said he would find more money to regularize employees. “I will not back down on this promise,” he pointed out, referring to his UP presidential nomination platform. Concepcion also assured the administrative personnel of the University’s legal protection in cases filed against them for performing their official duties.

“We should trust each other. I am one with you,” the President told more than 150 administrative personnel delegates, assuring them he would look after their welfare in his decisions."

During the 40th National Milo Marathon Finals, December 2016.

 

The current Chair of the UPV Healthy Lifestyle and Wellness Committee, Mary Lyncen M. Fernandez, is a staunch advocate of health, fitness and wellness.

“Six years ago, my blood chemistry was going through the roof. A doctor told me that I needed to take maintenance to control my blood sugar, uric acid, high cholesterol levels, and high blood pressure. I was a short, fat, middle-aged woman who weighed more than 80 kilos. I called myself ang babaeng walang leeg (the woman with no neck).”

Mary Lyncen says that was her wake-up call. She bargained with the doctor to give her three months to change her diet and vowed to undergo a regular exercise routine.

“My Lola died of a stroke in the shower. It was more than an hour before we found her body. My own mother had a stroke in her middle age. The fifth one left her paralyzed for nine years before she died. These two things flashed in my mind in the doctor’s office while listening to her talk about Lipitor, and Losartan.”

She says that she was fortunate to live inside the UP Visayas Miag-ao campus with its undulating roads that feature many uphill and downhill slopes. She started walking around and about the campus, which is also thickly populated by trees.

 

Trail Run, July 2017.

 

“Starting was the toughest part, maintaining it even more so. I remember the first time I tried to run up the road which I dubbed the Diwata Road because that is where the Diwata ng Dagat sculpture by National Artist Napoleon Abueva sits. It was the steepest hill inside the campus and I thought I would die after just a few meters. But the feeling of exhilaration stayed with me. It was awesome to have wings on your feet even for just a few seconds.”

Being the researcher that she is, she started to read extensively on how to become a runner. If she was going to be one, she said she might as well do it right.

“I remember my first fun-run, a 3K event in July 2010. I kept my head down for fear of seeing the snickers of people in seeing this fat, middle-aged woman hobble towards the finish line. What was running in my mind was that I would probably be the last to cross the finish line.”

Since then, she has signed up for other fun runs and the 3K progressed to 5K and 10K with some trail running thrown in. On December 2013, she crossed the finish line of her first half-marathon, a 21K run. After some setbacks, one of which was an operation to remove her gallbladder, she did her first full marathon this year in February at the age of 50.

“After I crossed the finish line and somebody put that 42K finisher’s medal on my neck, I wept on my husband’s shoulders. He was waiting for me at the finish line. All those years of running and self-training, waking up at 3:00 a.m. to run for three to four hours, running alone, doubting myself, lacing up my running shoes even when I didn’t feel like it, sidelined by sickness and injuries—these flashed through my mind. Never in my wildest dreams did I think that I would be a marathoner. I had never been athletic. Women were not encouraged to go into sports during my time. What is even more astounding is that only 1% of the world’s population has run marathons.”

For those looking to get fit and to sweat it out in Quezon City, there are few destinations more scenic or iconic than the UP Diliman campus.

Every day, thousands of people visit the 493-hectare campus, many with physical fitness in mind. Campus landmarks such as the Academic Oval, the National Science Complex and the Sunken Garden, among many others, have become go-to destinations for everyone from hardened athletes to beginners carrying out their very first exercise routines.

Truly, very few other places in the Metro offer fitness opportunities that are quite as scenic, safe and open as the UP System’s flagship campus.

This fact, when combined with the respectable annual showings of UP’s varsity athletes, might lead one to think that fitness is no serious concern for UP’s students in general. This, however, is not necessarily the case, as Dr. Shirley Villosillo-Guevarra, officer-in-charge of the UP Office of Student Housing (OSH) indicates—especially for the University’s beloved dormers.

A faculty member from the UP College of Home Economics (CHE) and a proponent of “holistic human development,” Guevarra notes that even the healthful atmosphere in UP has not prevented some dormers from dropping out or falling prey to various lifestyle and mental illnesses. While these cases have many causes, experts like Guevarra have been increasingly concerned by the stresses students face when meeting high-pressure academic requirements, as well as the attendant sedentary habits and isolation that can afflict dormers in particular."

September 4, 2017 | Written by Andre DP Encarnacion



In both sports and politics the goal of the “clean sweep” is one that competitors continually aspire to. Victory by an overwhelming margin, or a series of triumphs without a loss reflects excellence and superiority.

Since 2009, UP Mindanao’s BS Architecture program has been performing clean sweeps of its own. Through a combination of rigor, scholarship, and a sensitivity to regional needs, the program has maintained a record 100 percent passing rate among its graduates in the Architecture licensure exams up to the present year.

This achievement has also seen seven topnotchers from the ranks of its alumni. This is highly impressive for the College and the Humanities and Social Sciences-based unit that rose past a troubled start to embody the saying that success does indeed speak for itself.

What makes this young program the emerging powerhouse that it is today? We sat down with faculty members of the BS Architecture program to talk about who they are, what makes them unique, and their plans to strengthen the discipline in the future.

Silencing doubts

For a program that has brought such pride to the region, it is somewhat surprising that it barely made it through its first few years intact. The BS Architecture program was implemented in 1999, with a pioneer batch of only 12 students. From the beginning, says Dr. Isidoro Malaque III, who handled the first thesis batch in 2003, the program was beset with “birth pains,” resulting from early calls for its abolition.

One reason, he indicated, was the unique circumstances of UP Mindanao’s creation. This CU was mostly the brainchild of Congress, rather than the UP Board of Regents. Beyond politics, however, the constant question that was being leveled at the program members, given that UP Diliman already had an Architecture program, was “Why are you here?”

This annual call to justify their existence lit a fire under the members of the young program, which also saw the entry of long-time chairperson and now College Dean Jean Marie Juanga into the ranks at around that time. “Our faculty wanted to prove that Mindanao needed the program because Mindanao has its own built environment and planning issues,” Malaque says. “Eventually the faculty also inspired the students to do well.”

It was in 2007 that the program’s first licensure exam takers tested themselves and attained their first 100% exam results. These successes in both the exams and in research and extension would continue until, by 2012, not a single question about the program remained.

A research culture

The current faculty members, which now includes architects Ryan Songcayauon, Kristin Faye Olalo, Alexis Ken Cartajenas, Dan Jezreel Orendain, Mark Ndsy Puso, Angelo Felix Regalado and the current chairperson, Myrafe Sebastian-Ylagan, do agree that one major aspect of the program sets it and its graduates apart—a strong research culture.

They say that one of the biggest life-savers in human history was discovered by accident. In 1928, Alexander Fleming’s laboratory assistant accidentally left a window open overnight, allowing blue-green mold to contaminate a dish of Staphylococcus bacteria.

Initially incensed by this act of negligence, Fleming would, however, notice something unusual under the microscope—the bacteria surrounding the mold were either dying or dead. Somehow the mold was preventing the bacteria from forming new cell walls and reproducing.

As it turns out, the fungus in question was Penicillium chrysogenum. And the drug family that was developed from this natural substance, which we now know as penicillin, would change the course of medicine, allowing for the successful treatment of such historical killers as meningitis, pneumococcal pneumonia and syphilis.

Not content to wait for good luck to fly in through the window, many scientists would also be motivated by this development to set out in search of natural products to treat human ailments. Thus, so-called “mega-diverse” countries like the Philippines received significant scientific interest for the promise of novel compounds to be found in their terrestrial and marine environments.

Fresh from earning degrees in the United States and Japan, both Dr. Joel Hassan Tolentino and Dr. Aleyla de Cadiz of UP Mindanao’s College of Science and Mathematics (CSM) openly admit that such a quest was not initially on their minds. Experts in leukemia and amoeba transcriptomics, respectively, the pair decided to take on the challenge back home anyway, as researchers under the DOST PCHRD’s “Drug Discovery and Development of Health Products” program.

This commitment meant that Joel and Aleyla would be applying their hard-won skills for a new purpose. Their current goal is to find natural bioactive compounds against lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer deaths in the world. Their source? The endemic and abundant plants of Mindanao.

Plant persons

The DOST PCHRD’s program taps laboratories from around the country, including four UP constituent universities (CUs)—Diliman, Manila, Baguio, and Mindanao—in the search for drugs and therapies derived from natural products. In UP Mindanao’s case, the search for bioactive compounds involves sampling the area’s terrestrial plants and organisms.

This fact has necessarily turned both Drs. Tolentino and de Cadiz into “plant persons,” as they combed the region for samples to bring back to the laboratory. “In Phase One of the project,” Aleyla says, “we had to collect 300 plant extracts,” which were composed mostly of the bark, leaves and stems of around 110 plants that are either endemic, native to the country and Asia, or abundant onsite.

Together with their research assistants (RAs), both researchers saw their search for samples as an adventure. After their initial plan to do a collection in Mount Apo failed to materialize, Aleyla says they braved an almost three-hour walk through the fields to get to UP Mindanao’s land reserve, which in turn was cut short due to security issues. Finally, a chance discovery by one of their RAs led them to a semi-wild forest in Tagum’s Banana Beach Resort. With the owner’s support and a permit from the DENR, the team finally began their work in earnest.

Isolation and purification

After an extensive sample collection and identification stage, the project is now in its second phase, the one where the skill set of both microbiologists is brought to the fore. Joel calls this the “isolation and purification” phase.

At the end of the previous phase, the extracts for bioactivity against certain cancers and diseases were screened. In addition, he says, “we also test them on normal cells, like liver cells or kidney cells, to see if we can use them ‘as-is’ for treatments. Our ethnic groups, for example, use herbal plants as-is to treat their illness.” Some plants with cancer-killing activity, however, are toxic to humans."

The University’s long and rich tradition of celebrating while studying the arts has allowed its sons and daughters to carve out their niche in many industries and art forms. UP has made its mark in mainstream and popular art, but is also in those spaces where counterculture has thrived, through,among others, one of UP’s top cultural performing groups Kontra GaPi (Kontemporaryong Gamelang Pilipino), and Kidlat Tahimik’s films that earned him the well-deserved title of National Artist for Cinema.

 

An emerging form

In music, the growing counterculture phenomenon known as FlipTop (which refers to anything related to the actual genre or form “battle rap” or local hiphop) has amassed a significant online following, with its YouTube channel presence of three million subscribers and its Facebook page with more than 2.6 million likes. FlipTop is actually the Filipino hiphop multimedia production company behind the famous rap battles. To the unfamiliar and bewildered, hiphop refers to the culture and lifestyle that has rap as one of its art forms."

UP Diliman College of Music Professor and UP Artist II Jonas Baes had a famous kuya. Aloysius “Ochie” Baes, a Bantayog ng mga Bayani martyr, was a student leader who founded the Samahang Demokratiko ng Kabataan (SDK) chapter in UP Los Baños.

Arrested upon the declaration of martial law, Ochie endured prison through music, sometimes written on the child Jonas’ music sheets, which the latter always carried with him on family visits to the stockade. One song that he managed to smuggle out of prison was a kundiman adapted from an original by Bonifacio Abdon, a musician of the Philippine Revolution and one of the early music teachers at the UP Conservatory of Music. It was one of the first underground protest songs against martial law, “Mutya.”

Not long after, in the second half of the ‘70s, musically-inclined campus activists in UP Los Baños formed Tulisanes, a group that collected, created, and performed protest music from those who, like Ochie, had committed their lives to the service of the masses. It was through them that college student Jonas lived his own youthful activism.

 

 

Art and conscience

Prof. Jonas recalls being active in Tulisanes in the late 1970s while he was taking up music in UP Diliman. He regularly commuted between Diliman and Los Baños where he composed and played music for his collective and the so-called parliament of the streets.

But in the College of Music in Diliman, he immersed himself in the state-sponsored project of ethnomusicology, which was being led by future National Artists Jose Maceda and Ramon Santos. Instead of co-opting the student to pursue the state narrative, ethnomusicology would be responsible for bringing maturity to Jonas’ activism, as it entailed deeper immersion among indigenous peoples and creating music for and with the communities. It was in the college where Jonas’ art and his social conscience seamlessly merged.

Now a professor of composition, Jonas is vocal in his support for the cultural collective, for music’s need to be true to its source. For him, protest music by Filipinos should not just vocalize poetry while assuming borrowed forms. Jonas aspires for music whose form is also a protest statement by being more originally Filipino.

His musical projects, like his most widely-performed composition “Patangis Buwaya” based on the narratives of the Iraya Mangyans of Mindoro, echo the cries of indigenous peoples as they suffer from displacement and the exploitation of their living spaces by aggressive development.

Jonas’ musical history is a reflection of the history of modern Philippine protest music itself, covering its rise from the kundiman toward more indigenously-grounded forms.

When Typhoon Glenda tore through Southern Luzon in July 2014, some of UP Los Baños’ treasured trees—old and huge acacia and mahogany—didn’t escape the tropical cyclone’s wrath. But they’ve been given new life, so to speak, as furniture in all ten UPLB dormitories.

This was initiated by the UPLB Housing Office (UHO), which takes care of student and staff housing on campus. And UHO Director Zoilo Belano Jr. says they’re not even done. Four years after the disaster, there are still slabs of wood waiting to be repurposed and pieces in the makeshift workshop to be finished.

 

Saving trees, saving on cost

Belano explains that when he proposed the project to campus officials, he told them that he didn’t want the trees to simply go to waste and that he had seen wood furniture in Australia they could use as inspiration. In addition, the University wouldn’t have to spend on plastic furniture for the residence halls.

It wasn’t hard to get the UPLB administration on board. “Chancellor Fernando Sanchez and Vice Chancellor for Community Affairs Serlie Jamias loved the idea and even showed me some examples of repurposing they had seen in Japan,” Belano continues.

The UHO carpenters got to work. Their main duties were focused on repairs and other minor construction jobs for housing units under the UHO jurisdiction. Furniture-making wasn’t really part of their tasks and it was something many had to learn.

July 30, 2018 | Written by Celeste Ann Castillo Llaneta



In the alchemy of social change, technology is only one part of the formula. The other, arguably more complex part, is people. This can be seen in the journey to bring the technology dubbed CLINN-GEM, or the Community-Led Integrated Non-Cyanide Non-Mercury Gold Extraction Method, out of project leader Dr. Herman D. Mendoza’s laboratory at the UP Department of Mining, Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, and into the communities and day-to-day lives of the country’s artisanal and small-scale miners (ASMs).

For this part of CLINN-GEM’s journey, the other half of the CLINN-GEM team and Dr. Mendoza’s good friend takes the helm: Dr. Oscar P. Ferrer of the Department of Community Development, UP College of Social Work and Community Development, who came in with his own teams sometime from 2013 to 2014 to handle the social prep work.

“I said to Doc Oskee, we need to work together, because we’re not just talking about the technology, but the community that will use it,” Dr. Mendoza recalls. “We’re trying to marry the community and the technology, and that’s the challenge.”

Dr. Ferrer explains further: “For large-scale mines, mining is about profit. But for ASMs, this is economic subsistence, livelihoods. If they mine today, they must come home at night with something to put on the table to feed their families. That’s the most challenging part of organizing.” Large scale mines, of course, operate far above the level of day-to-day survival that ASMs do, and can afford the delays that come with transitioning between technologies. But ASMs? “All their lives, what they know to do is amalgamation and cyanidation. Then you come in with a new, environment-friendly technology. What exactly will they do during the transition?”

This is not about resistance to change. Neither is this a lack of awareness of the dangers of amalgamation and cyanidation. The grassroots miners are open to innovations that are beneficial to their communities and families, because of course they are. “They know that mercury tainting the river means death. They know what is environment-friendly or not. This is their milieu, and we have to value that,” says Dr. Ferrer. “It’s in how you handle the balance between the economic needs of the people and the environment. How you treat mining in small communities is different. This is not an issue of anti-mining. This is an issue of human lives.”

 

Transmutation and change

So they began with the easiest among the four localities: Benguet, where the ASMs were already organized under the Benguet Federation of Small-Scale Miners, Inc.; therefore, they had a voice and power of their own. Even then, the UP team had to convince the miners of the advantages of CLINN-GEM. They did so by way of a side-by-side competition or parallel testing with the old ways, which Dr. Ferrer laughingly compares to a track-and-field race that Dr. Mendoza’s CLINN-GEM inevitably won. Moreover, the parallel testing did not even take in the environmental damage and the cost that would be incurred when using the old and dangerous techniques of amalgamation and cyanidation.

There’s something alchemical about extracting precious gold using deadly mercury and cyanide. But for the many who work in artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM), this bit of alchemy is a grim reality that often results in mercury or cyanide poisoning, death, and environmental degradation.

Worldwide, some 15 million artisanal or small miners mine for gold using mercury or cyanide. In the Philippines, which is one of the most mineral-rich countries especially in gold, nickel, copper and chromite, some 300,000 gold miners rely on ASM as their main source of income, producing around 80% of the country’s gold supply. They earn somewhere between P300 to P1500 a day, but they pay for this with their lives, mining under unsafe conditions and using mercury via mercury amalgamation and cyanide via gold cyanidation to extract and purify gold from the ore.

 

Worth its weight in gold

This problem called for an engineering, not alchemical, solution. Enter CLINN-GEM, which is short for the Community-Led Integrated Non-Mercury Non-Cyanide Gold Extraction Method. CLINN-GEM is the brainchild of its project leader, Dr. Herman D. Mendoza of the UP College of Engineering’s Department of Mining, Metallurgical and Materials Engineering (DMMME), who worked on it from 2008 to 2012. At the time, the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), under its Engineering Research and Development for Technology (ERDT) program, had been spurring research under its environment and infrastructure R&D track, which included the Better Mine program.

“Better Mine is meant to make the mining and mineral industry better, but we were interested in small-scale mining. We knew there were serious problems in ASM,” Dr. Mendoza recalls.

Their top priority was taking mercury and cyanide out of the entire extraction process. So Dr. Mendoza and his teams began developing technological alternatives to amalgamation and cyanidation for extracting gold as well as copper. They hit on the idea of using gravity to separate the gold from the ore by taking advantage of gold’s specific gravity and the way it behaves when placed in water.

But for gold that has become as fine as dust and exponentially harder for small-scale miners to recover, Dr. Mendoza and his teams added a spin, so to speak. They used centrifugal force to enhance the separation of very fine gold particles and recover gold form the non-gold particles. This process is called enhanced gravity concentration, and work well in collecting both free coarse gold and very fine gold particles.

 

Engineering over alchemy

But collecting the free gold is relatively easy, and many small-scale miners have had to settle for collecting only the gold nuggets and dust and discarding the rest as irrecoverable. However, gold comes in another form—as associated gold, or gold mixed in with or embedded into other minerals. To extract this gold without resorting to amalgamation and cyanidation, Dr. Mendoza and his team collected ore samples from various parts of the country, studied their characteristics, and came up with a practical extraction process: flotation and leaching.

The first step is flotation, which produces a concentrate consisting of gold associated with extraneous material and waste. The concentrate then goes through a leaching stage, which transforms the waste matrix into a leachable form in order to dissolve the gold easily, resulting in a loaded solution with gold ions, commonly called a pregnant solution.

The solution with the dissolved gold then undergoes precipitation, with Dr. Mendoza and his team adding a “precipitant” to fully separate or leach the gold from the copper and remaining minerals. The precipitated gold sinks to the bottom of the solution, ready to be collected and refined. The recovery of gold from the ore is maximized, resulting in more profit for the small-miners.

 

Better, safer, more earth-friendly gold

Extracting more gold more efficiently is only one half of what CLINN-GEM can do. The other half is dealing with one of the worst issues regarding the mining industry: tailings and waste. Dr. Mendoza points out that of every batch of ore dug out, only 0.1% of it is actually extracted and collected as valuable while the remaining 99.9% is discarded as waste. These waste materials are usually composed of fine particles, and when combined with the marine environment, they can wreak havoc upon the entire ecology. This is true for all kinds of mining, whether ASMs or large-scale.

But CLINN-GEM has a way of treating the waste materials produced by mineral processing in a way that does minimal impact upon the environment. The waste produced by the enhanced gravitation concentration process consists of associated gold, and is put through the flotation and leaching processes to further squeeze the gold out of it.

The University of the Philippines community takes pride in its official bands and orchestra: the UP Symphonic Band, a Student Performing Arts Group; the UP ROTC Band, its marching band; and, the UP Symphony Orchestra, its newest system-wide orchestra.

 

UP Symphonic Band

The UP Symphonic Band has proven itself worthy of the Honorific Award for Student Performing Arts Group (HASPAG) for all its accomplishments in local and international concerts and events throughout the years.

Initially named in 1986 as the UP-Philippine Youth Symphonic Band (PYSB), the group formally changed its name to “UP Symphonic Band” in 1998 under the leadership of its Music Director and Conductor, Asst. Prof. Rodney Ambat of the UP College of Music.

Last October 2018, the band held its “Symphonicity” concert at the Abelardo Hall, its latest in its long list of remarkable concerts held at venues such as the Abelardo Hall Auditorium, the Cultural Center of the Philippines, the Philamlife Theater, Concert at the Park in Luneta, and many others. Also recently, the band performed at the closing concert of the UP College of Music centennial in September 2017, the CCP Tanghalang Aurelio Tolentino in April 2017, and the CCP International Winds and Jazz Festival in July 2016.

Many of its members are winners of the National Music Competition for Young Artists (NAMCYA) and Philippine Representatives to the Asian Youth Orchestra and Southeast Asian Youth Orchestra and Wind Ensemble (SAYOWE)."

January 5, 2018 | Written by Arlyn VCD Palisoc Romualdo



Step aside, soybean meal, and get ready for competition. Protein-enriched copra meal (PECM) is here to challenge your position as a main ingredient in animal feed.

Developed over the last ten years by Dr. Laura J. Pham and her team at the UP Los Baños (UPLB) National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (BIOTECH), PECM was created by treating copra meal with microorganisms to enhance its protein content.

Copra meal or copra cake is a byproduct of coconut oil extraction and has around 20 percent protein content. Through UPLB BIOTECH’s patented process, the protein content was raised to as much as 44 percent—quite close to soy meal’s 46 percent.

So why is this significant?

The Philippines is one of the world’s top coconut producers. According to 2015 data released by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) in January of this year, coconut products were the country’s number one agricultural export commodity, with copra meal earnings of US$70.42 million.

Copra meal is already being used in animal feed mixes, but its composition—not enough protein and too much fiber—doesn’t make it an ideal main ingredient, which is what soybean meal is.

The problem with soybean meal? It’s not locally abundant, so local feed producers and farmers need to have this protein source imported. This need is so great that the same PSA data shows soybean meal as the country’s second top agricultural import commodity, costing US$888.4 million. “This product was sourced from the USA, accounting for 77.3 percent of the total value of imports,” the agency says. The Philippines was, in fact, identified as “the largest market for US soybean meal” by a 2016 Global Agricultural Information Network report of the US Department of Agriculture.

There’s some kind of food revolution going on at UP Los Baños (UPLB) and it’s begun to take root in student dormitories.

Edible gardening is gaining ground as a way of providing students not only more nutritious options in their diet but also food in dorms when students can’t go out to eat. It seems only right, since UPLB is the country’s leading institution in agriculture. The effort also ties in neatly with the University’s initiative on edible landscapes.

“Sometimes we have students who are short on cash, so they scrimp and skip meals. Or there are those who study late into the night only to realize it’s far too late to go out and buy a proper meal,” says UPLB Housing Office (UHO) Director Zoilo Belano Jr. on how the idea of edible gardening in dorms came about. He added that some of the more healthy choices are also cheaper, so fruits and vegetables freely harvested from the gardens make better sense.

October 3, 2017 | Written by Arlyn VCD Palisoc Romualdo



Attention, fruit farmers and exporters: there’s a new way to extend the shelf life of your produce! That’s right. UP Los Baños scientists have discovered a way to help the fruit industry cut back its post-harvest losses by making produce last longer.

Dr. Veronica C. Sabularse, Dr. Hidelisa P. Hernandez, and Rhea DC Mallari from the Institute of Chemistry have created Fruitect Mango, a liquid coating formulation that delays the ripening of Carabao mango. Other formulations are suited for White Sunrise papaya, PPY-14 papaya, Smooth Cayenne pineapple, and Lacatan banana.

It’s easy to apply. It can be brushed on harvested fruits or it can be used as a dipping solution. It rinses off with just water because it’s not like the usual wax-based coating which needs to be removed with soap and water. In addition, it’s green technology. It comes from agricultural waste, which makes it a byproduct that prevents main agricultural products from going to waste.

According to the team, initial data showed that Fruitect can also minimize moisture loss, shriveling, and abrasion during transport. But the measure of success lies in one very important factor: taste. One would think that delaying the natural ripening process would affect the freshness and taste of the produce, but it doesn’t.

“Our research assistants ate the fruits in our experiments and they all said, ‘Masarap!’ [Delicious!] Rhea can attest to that,” Hernandez says with a laugh. “So, no. There were no observed changes in taste. The fruits tasted the way they were supposed to, comparable to freshly picked ripened fruits from the farm,” adds Sabularse.

The backstory

Sabularse actually started working on coating formulations back in 1996. “The idea of coatings has been around for a long time,” she says. “That’s what I worked on when I was on fellowship in Australia and when I came back, I had the idea of making use of agricultural processing waste.”

In 2010, Sabularse’s proposed research on nanobiocomposite coatings was one of four exploratory projects on nanotechnology funded by the Philippine Council for Advanced Science and Technology Research and Development, now the Philippine Council for Industry, Energy and Emerging Technology Research and Development (PCIEERD), of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST). Three years later, the council’s nanotech exploration had become a program and Sabularse and Hernandez had already joined together and were granted funding for additional research."
From Grief to Gratitude – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/from-grief-to-gratitude/,"


Emely Amoloza lost her daughter to cancer seven years ago. But it was gratitude, not grief, that pushed the then administrative officer at the UP Open University (UPOU) to launch a public service initiative that has become an anticipated annual event: the UPOU Blood Donation Drive.

Her daughter was a quiet young woman who was enjoying university life as a second-year Applied Physics major at UP Los Baños (UPLB). She spent her free time reaching out to children who lived near the train tracks outside campus. She shared her knowledge with them, showed them kindness the best way she knew how. She didn’t even tell her mother about it; she didn’t think herself or what she did exceptional. It was only at Haydelle’s wake, when those children came to visit, that Emely realized the extent of her daughter’s generosity and compassion for others.

Haydelle was diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2010. Things looked good after her operation, but life took a heartbreaking turn just a few months later. It was December when they learned that the cancer had returned. In January 2011, it had metastasized and was classified as stage IV. She succumbed to her illness on April 18, 2011—twelve days after she had turned 19.

 

Paying it forward

“When you go through something like this, you don’t really expect an outpouring of support. But there it was and it was really overwhelming,” Emely recalls, teary-eyed.

Relatives, friends, former classmates at the UP Rural High School and UPLB—hers and Haydelle’s, and UPOU colleagues—rallied around the Amoloza family during those difficult times. And it was something that stayed with Emely. “I was so grateful at the amount of help that was extended to us. I still am. We were really blessed to have received so much love.”

It was that feeling of gratitude and her daughter’s kindness that inspired Emely to find a way of helping others, to provide what they need. While it wasn’t very challenging for their family to find blood supplies for Haydelle, she knew that other patients weren’t as fortunate as her daughter. “I thought a blood drive would be a good way of paying it forward.”"

Two Yokohama women — both daughters of former samurai — may have become footnotes in Philippine history, but not in the lives of two important 19th-century Filipino reformists now considered heroes.

Usui Seiko, more popularly known as O Sei San, and Udagawa Okiyo intersected the lives of national hero Jose Rizal (1861-1896) and Mariano Ponce (1863-1918), respectively, during the two reformists’ stay in Yokohama, a port city some 40 km south of Tokyo.

Rizal was on a six-week stay in Yokohama enroute to Europe via the United States in the spring of 1888 when he met Usui. Ponce was detailed there as diplomatic representative of the Emilio Aguinaldo-led First Republic from June 1898 to September 1899, during which time he courted Udagawa.

Usui has gone down in Philippine history as Rizal’s Japanese romantic interest who introduced him to Japanese culture as they went on afternoon strolls talking in French.  Udagawa became Ponce’s wife, left Japan with him, converted into Christianty, bore him children, and never returned to her homeland. Both women lived long enough to witness their Filipino beaus enshrined in the pantheon of Philippine national heroes and experience World War II from opposite sides.

UPCIS students, some of whom visited Ferris University in November last year as part of the Ferris University Short Stay Visit/Exchange Program, discussed unsatisfactory Philippine government rehabilitation efforts in Eastern Visayas in the wake of Typhoon Yolanda in 2013, where official data showed only 33% of housing targets had been completed as of 2017.

During the small group discussions, the Japanese students expressed trust on their government, while the Filipinos wondered where the rehabilitation funds had gone."

12 tips for UPCAT examinees – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/12-tips-for-upcat-examinees/,"


 

Read the instructions that were provided to you by the UP Office of Admissions. Check your test permit for complete entries, the dry seal on part of your photo, and your signature. This will save you the trouble of doing it on the test day itself.

 

Visit your testing hall in advance so you get there easier when UPCAT day comes. Avoid the frantic search. You don’t want to waste time and end up being late for the test even if you arrived early. For those who will take the test in UP Diliman, you were given maps and you can check out http://diskover.up.edu.ph to get more info.

 

Condition yourself to be calm and focused. Make sure you get a good night’s rest and a proper, but not heavy, meal before the exam. Avoid wearing clothes that are too tight or may cause discomfort. Be ready with a jacket or sweater in case it gets cold. If you feel anxious, take slow, deep breaths to relax.

 

Be early. Arrive at your testing hall before 6:30 AM for the morning session and before 12:30 PM for the afternoon session.

Compassion, Our Common Ground

Investiture Speech of

Danilo L. Concepción

21st President, University of the Philippines

20 September 2017, 5:00 p.m., University Theater

 

I stand before you today as a student trained in two disciplines: that of science, which taught me the measure of Nature, and that of the law, which taught me the measure of Man. I cannot claim that I have learned enough because education is a lifelong process, and I expect to live a little longer. But this I have surely come to realize: that while Nature may be bewilderingly complex, Man is infinitely more so.

If I had remained an agricultural engineer, I might have been happy designing new tools for farming or more effective irrigation systems. But ultimately, I found law more challenging, that which is the calibration and codification of human and social behavior.

And as if that were not enough, and even before UP, I took on teaching and university administration—which, in a strange but logical way, draw on all these threads of thought and experience to form a coherent wholeness of purpose.

Indeed the university is probably the one institution in society—with the possible exception of Congress—where diversity and difference are its very nature and intrinsic to its success.

Today, with nearly 200 undergraduate and almost 350 graduate programs, UP can proudly claim to offer the broadest canopy under which Filipino students and scholars can learn. Nowhere else in this country can you take such diverse courses as Archeology, Geomatics Engineering, Tropical Landscape Architecture, and Women and Development.

That is what a national university is for, and that is why UP is one. We recognize that a national university exists not to profit the pocket, but to enrich the mind and to enlarge the soul of our people. We stand firm in the belief that all forms of knowledge benefit humanity, and that part of our mission is to employ that knowledge for social transformation.

At his investiture in 1911, our first President, Dr. Murray Bartlett, made it clear that the new University of the Philippines was not merely going to be a copy of its models in the West but would be a “University for Filipinos” devoted to providing “the intellectual and moral leadership essential to social salvation and progressive national development.”

It seems ironic today—given our much-vaunted nationalism and secularism—to remark that Dr. Bartlett was an American and a Protestant pastor. But that irony offers vivid proof that our founders understood that creating a great university would mean stepping out of one’s own moorings into a true community of minds.

And so, difference and diversity have been with us since the beginning—and of course, dissension and debate, especially since the University Council was first set up. But again, and notably, we have managed to harmonize our differences over more than a century of discourse to forge a way forward—whether it be in terms of crafting a curriculum for general education, or rewarding performance and productivity.

Therein lies our University’s vitality—not in the fact that we argue, because argue we must, but in the fact that we have always managed at some point to agree, because agree we also must.

Dissent has been coded into our DNA, the most familiar expression of the critical thinking we have sought to imbue every UP student with. But we also know that between academic inquiry and practical necessity lies much common ground to explore and to inhabit.

On June 8, 1933, students at the College of Education boycotted their classes in the first protest ever against a tuition fee increase, from P30 to P50 per semester. Among the leaders of the mass action was none other than Fe Palma, daughter of then UP President Rafael Palma. History does not record what President Palma said to his daughter afterwards, but I suppose he should have been proud, as she was a product of the liberal education that he himself espoused in his inaugural address.

Four years later in 1937, when President Quezon pushed for the transfer of UP from Padre Faura to Diliman, UP students led by a young editor named Armando Malay held a straw vote that resoundingly rejected the move by 84 percent.

The critics complained that Diliman was a dark and mountainous territory teeming with snakes, monkeys, and mosquitoes. Then UP President Bienvenido Gonzalez was crucified. But twelve years later, when the move had finally happened, Malay spoke again, but this time in Diliman, and acknowledged that it was time “for a closing of the ranks.”

These instances of dissent were classically and uniquely UP. We ourselves have made this possible, empowering and emboldening generations of students with reason, enabling them, as Palma put it, “to react properly to the promptings of truth and to the world.” We—and perhaps we alone—have justly and proudly held reason above all other considerations in our academic life: considerations such as creed, kinship, privilege, authority.

And it is this supremely valuable faculty to which I appeal today, as I grasp the helm of this great enterprise we call the University of the Philippines. Let reason guide us, but not reason alone; let it be reason tempered with respect, responsibility, and collegiality.

Both at the national and university levels, it is becoming difficult to push any agenda forward without being subjected to intense, sometimes malicious, but also often necessary scrutiny. In many instances, we have stopped talking to one another as a people sharing the same future.

Truth, reason, and respect have been the prime casualties in these exchanges, which I am sure you have witnessed—if not participated in—online. The phrase “social media” has almost become an oxymoron, as it has become the stalking ground of some of the most unsociable people you could come across.

Sad to say, some of that caustic and deeply divisive rhetoric has come to infect our University, not just our students but our faculty, staff, and administrators as well. This is perhaps to be expected, as a university remains, in many ways, merely a microcosm of a much larger society.

Our strength lies in our collegiality. If we allow our reason and our rhetoric to be clouded by intolerance, then we will be no more and no better than a gang, indeed than any other collection of ill-tempered individuals.

At his investiture in 1975, another of my predecessors, President Onofre D. Corpuz, openly took issue with the University’s characterization as “a battleground of ideas,” calling it a “romantic notion” that the people could ill afford to pay for with their taxes.

Rather than a battleground, I prefer to focus on finding, in this University, a common ground, a clearing—a safe, free, and congenial space within which its constituents can teach, study, and work productively to their full potential.

UP must be that special place within which it should still be possible—despite all divisions and distractions—to work together with the University’s and the nation’s strategic interests in mind.

For this we must promote consensus over conflict, civility over calumny, and collaboration over confrontation. We must foster strategic thinking over short-sightedness, honest labor over opportunism, and shared effort over self-promotion.

There should be no better place in this country than UP for the expression of ideas without fear, without fear of violent retribution from one’s colleagues or from the State itself. There should be no environment more welcoming than UP for cutting-edge research, timely policy studies, exciting new exhibits and productions, and provocative art and literature—in other words, the work we have always meant to do, and do best.

We will be guided by the overarching vision of UP as a leading regional and global university in an environment that sustains 21st century learning, knowledge creation, and public service for society and humanity.

Where our University is situated today would not have been possible without the foundations laid by my esteemed predecessors, whom I acknowledge and thank today, and to whom I make a personal pledge to do my best to live up to their example. President Edgardo Angara, who was not able to make it today, Presidents Emanuel Soriano, Emil Javier, Jose Abueva, Francisco Nemenzo, Emerlinda Roman, and Alfredo Pascual—sa inyo pong lahat, tanggapin ninyo ang aming taos pusong pasasalamat, paggalang, at pagpupugay!

Bunsod ng ating hangaring ituloy ang mga mahahalaga at makabuluhang pagbabago, at sa paniniwalang mayroon tayong maia-ambag sa hangaring ito, ini-alay po natin ang ating sarili upang maglingkod bilang Pangulo. Nagsama-sama po tayo sa ating pakay at galaw, at dahil dito, tayo po ay nanaig at nagtagumpay.

Ngayon, ang tagumpay na ito ang simula ng ating pagkilos upang patunayan sa lahat na ang mga pangarap at adhikain na sinampalatayaan at pinanghawakan ng ating mga kasama, kakampi man o katunggali, ay kaya nating maisakatuparan at makamtan. Lahat po ng ating balak at panukala ay matutupad at matatapos kung tayo po ay magsa-sama-samang muli sa pagpaplano, pagpapasya, at pagpapapatupad sa lahat ng ating gagawin para sa pagsusulong ng minimithing pagbabago.

Upang tayo ay magtagumpay, ang tatlong sangkap ng ating Unibersidad: ang mga mag-aaral, ang kaguruan, at ang mga kawani, ay dapat na magkabigkis-bigkis tungo sa isang layunin. Nasa pagkakaisa nating lahat lamang ang susi ng tagumpay. Totoo, ang pagkakaisa ay tunay na mailap at mahirap makamit sapagkat lubhang maraming pagkakaiba ang ating mga pangangailangan, paniniwala, at pamantayan. Subalit tayo ay nananalig na mayroong isang tagpuan kung saan lahat tayo ay maaring tumayong sama-sama na parang isang katawan. Bilang isang katawan, tiyak nating mapagtatanto at madarama na ang sakit ng kalingkingan ay sakit ng buong katawan. Ang sakit na iniinda ng sinuman sa atin, ay sakit na iindahin ng lahat natin. Hindi natin marahil napapansin subalit ang tagpuang ito ay nasa mga puso na natin. Kailangan lamang po nating itong mapagtanto at madama.

At upang tayo ay manatiling magkakayakap sa ating tagpuan, tayo po bilang Pangulo, ang magsisilbing isang pagkit na sa ating lahat ay hahatak at magdi-dikit upang wala ni-isa man sa atin ang mawalay o malisya.

Tayo po ay nakalaang makinig kanino man upang malaman ang inyong mga loobin, balak, at pangangailangan upang tayo po ay magabayan sa ating pag-ugit. Sa atin pong pamumuno, mas mahalaga ang kagalingan ng lahat kaysa sa ating personal na pananaw o kagustuhan.

Sa ating pagpapasya sa mga hakbang na ating tatahakin, ang ating gabay at panuntunan ay pagmamalasakit. Pagmamalasakit sa ating Unibersidad, pagmamalasakit sa ating mga propesyon, pagmamalasakit sa ating mga sarili, at pagmamalasakit sa isa’t isa. Kung tayo po ay nagmamalasakit, tayo ay lubos na nag-iingat; nag-iingat na ang ating bawat kilos at galaw ay hindi makasasakit o makasasama sa bawat isa sa atin.

Kung pagkakaisa ang susi sa tagumpay ng ating mga mithiin, pagmamalasakit naman ang susi tungo sa isang samahang wagas at pangmatagalan.

Sa susunod na anim na taon na ating hahawakan ang timon, ito po ay ating hahawakan nang mahigpit at maingat sapagkat maraming hamon at balakid ang ating haharapin, bubunuin, at gagapiin. Sa simula pa lamang ng ating pag-ugit, isang malaking hamon ang agad ay sumalubong sa atin: ang libreng matrikula sa kolehiyo.

Tunay po na ito ay isang malaking hamon sapagkat animnapung porsyento ng ating koleksyon mula sa matrikula ay nakalaan para sa ating mga faculty development programs. Kung hindi po ibibigay sa atin ng national government ang katumbas ng dapat ay ating koleksyon, wala po tayong malilikom na pondo na sadyang ilalaan sa mga programang magpapaunlad sa katayuan ng ating kaguruan.

Bukod dito, bagama’t totoong libre na nga ang tuition sa UP, makapasa naman kaya sa UPCAT ang mga kapus-palad na kabataan na sa UP ay nais makapag-aral?

Wala pong saysay at kabuluhan ang programang libreng matrikula kung sa UPCAT ang estudyante ay di naman papasa. Sa mga nakalipas na pagsasaliksik at pag-aaral, napag-alaman na maliit na bahagi lamang ng mga nagtatapos sa maraming public high schools sa labas ng Metro Manila ang pumapasa sa UPCAT. Ang sinisisi pong dahilan ay ang mababang kalidad ng pagtuturo sa mga public high schools na ito.

Dahil dito, panukala po natin na gawing kondisyon sa pagtanggap sa isang estudyante ang pagbibigay ng balik-serbisyo sa ating bayan; balik-serbisyong isang taon pagkaraang makatapos ang estudyante sa kanyang kurso. Sa loob nang isang taon, siya po ay ating pagtuturuin sa senior high school sa mga public schools na ito upang kahit-manawari ay tumaas ang kalidad ng kanilang edukasyon.

Ang kondisyong balik-serbisyo ay hindi naman po sapilitan. Malaya po ang estudyante na hindi magbalik-serbisyo, dangan siya po sa halip ay magbabayad ng matrikula kung siya po ay tatanggi bago makatapos, o ang buong halaga ng kanyang edukasyon kung siya ay tatanggi kapag siya ay nakapagtapos na. Hindi rin po libre ang pag-babalik-serbisyo. May bayad po sila habang sila ay nagtuturo.

Ganoon pa man, tayo po ay lubos na umaasa na magbabalik-serbisyo ang ating mga iskolar ng bayan. Ito na po ang kanilang pagkakataon na isabuhay ang kanilang isinisigaw na pagmamahal sa bayan. Ito na po ang pagkakataon na patunayan nila sa kanilang mga sarili ang panawagan nilang maglingkod sa kapus-palad nating mga kababayan.

Madalas pong magmartsa ang ating mga estudyante, sumisigaw ng pagbabago. Kung ating pong wawariin, parang wala nang katapusan ang kanilang mga reklamo at kahilingan; parang ibig nilang sila na ang magpalakad sa ating Unibersidad, at sila ay mag-aral nang sang-ayon tangi sa kanilang pasya at kagustuhan.

Subalit sinasabi natin ngayon sa kanila, na hinding-hindi natin sila pipigilan sa kanilang pagpapahayag ng kanilang mga kaisipan at paniniwala; hinding hindi natin sila bubusalan sa kanilang mga hinaing. Bagkus, sila ay ating pakikinggan, uunawain, at gagabayan. Hindi po natin hinuhubog ang ating mga estudyante sa isang hulmahan. Hinuhubog po natin sila upang magkaroon ng isang malaya, mapanuri, mapagtanong, at malikhaing pag-iisip; upang sila ay magtaglay ng diwang walang takot, ng tinig na hindi pasusupil; at upang sila ay manindigan para sa katwiran at katarungan.

Sa ating kaguruan, ang lakas natin ay nasa ating kakayahang mag-talo at magpasya bilang isang kalipunan. Ang kakayahang ito ay ating itataguyod at pag-iibayuhin nang marubdob.

Pagsisikapan nating malikom ang pondong kailangan ng ating faculty development programs upang hindi maputol ang mga programang nasimulan na, at upang madagdagan pa.

At upang manatili sa Unibersidad ang ating mahuhusay na kaguruan, pag-aaralan po natin na luwagan ang mga regulasyon sa tenure at promotion upang ang mga ito ay maging mas patas at mas makatarungan. Marapat din na sila ay bigyan natin ng magandang working condition, at masaya at masiglang buhay-akademiko sa ating mga campus.

Titiyakin po natin na maitayo muli ang nasunog na Facuty Center sa loob ng 3 taon. Ang bagong Faculty Center po na ito ay magiging mas malaki, mas moderno, at mas faculty-friendly.

Ang ating pong kaguruan ay binibigyan ng lipunan ng pinakamataas na pagkilala at paggalang habang sila ay nagtuturo sa ating Unibersidad. Hindi po natin papayagan na sila ay mawalan ng dignidad matapos na sila ay magretiro sa pagtuturo. Marahil, dapat tayong magtayo ng isang opisina na walang gagawin kung hindi ihanda ang ating kaguruan para sa kanilang pag-reretiro, at upang sila ay gabayan at tulungan sa kanilang mga pangangailangan, lalong-lalo na sa usapin ng pabahay.

Nakalista po sa ating priority projects ang pagpapaganda sa ating mga campuses. Nangangailangan na po ng rehabilitasyon ang ating mga gusali at mga dormitoryo. Dapat na po nating wakasan ang masakit na biro na walang malinis at mabangong CR dito sa UP.

Tayo po ay nananawagan sa ating mga alumni na sana tayo ay tulungan at damayan sa krusadang ito. Sa mga matagumpay nating alumni na tumira at nakinabang sa murang bayad sa ating mga dormitoryo, sana’y masumpungan nila sa kanilang mga puso ang magsukli at tumulong sa ating pagbabangong-anyo.

Pagsisikapan din po nating magtayo ng pangalawang Philippine General Hospital dito sa UP Diliman. Kasama po sa itatayo ang kakambal nitong College of Medicine at Genomic Cancer Research Institute. Ang medical complex po na ito ay magbibigay-serbisyo sa komunidad ng UP Diliman at ng hilagang Metro-Manila. Ang College of Medicine ay magdaragdag ng mga duktor sa ating bansa at ang Institute po naman ay tutuklas ng lunas sa cancer gamit ang makabagong siyensya ng genomics.

Pangarap po natin na ang PGH na ito ay maging pinaka moderno at pinaka magandang ospital sa buong bansa. Naniniwala po tayo na kaya nating isakatuparan ang pangarap na ito sa tulong ninyong lahat at ng lokal at pambansang pamahalaan.

Para naman po sa ating mga kawani, sinimulan na po natin ang proseso upang gawing regular ang mga kawaning matatagal na sa serbisyo. Sapagkat mangangailangan ito ng mga karagdang plantilla positions, ang proceso po ay inaasahan nating magtatagal. Subalit habang tayo po ay naghihintay,   itataas na po natin ang mga non-UP contractuals, yaong matatagal na po sa serbisyo, sa antas ng UP Contractuals upang sila ay tumanggap na ng lahat ng benepisyo ng isang regular na empleyado. Ganoon pa man, inaasahan natin na ang mga kawani ay magmamalasakit din para sa kapakanan ng ating Unibersidad. Huwag sana nilang igiit ang kanilang mga kahilingan kung ito ay hindi kayang pasanin ng ating kabang-yaman.

Kasabay nito, kailangan po nating suriing mabuti ang pangangailangan ng ating operasyon upang ang laki ng ating administrative workforce ay maging tugma rito, at hindi tuluyang lumobo. Ang salop na umaapaw ay di na po dapat dagdagan.

Sa ibabaw po ng lahat nang ito, i-aangkas natin ang ating mga reporma sa ating procurement system, sa automation ng ating mga operating systems, at sa paggamit ng ating mga pondo at resources.

Tayo po sa ngayon ang nag-iisang Pambansang Unibersidad. Subalit ang karangalan pong ito ay may kaakibat na tungkulin para sa mga unibersidad at kolehiyo sa buong bansa, pribado man o pambupliko. Sa ilalim po ng ating pagmamasid, itataguyod natin ang tambalan ng UP sa mga unibersidad at kolehiyo na ibig makipagtulungan sa ating mga gawaing akademiko at pananaliksik. Pag-aaralan po natin ang pagbalangkas sa isang facility-sharing scheme para sa ating mga SUCs.

Dumako naman po tayo sa usaping informal settlers. Lingid sa karamihan, ang pamilya po natin, minsan, ay naging informal settler din. Kung kaya po damang-dama rin natin ang nararamdaman ng ating mga kababayang nakikitirik sa ating mga lupain. Bibigyan po natin ng tamang pansin ang kanilang kapakanan. Ang kanilang kagalingan ay lagi po nating ilalahok sa lahat ng balak at pagpa-plano sa pagsasa-ayos ng ating mga campus. Hindi po tayo gigiba ng bahay kung ito ay gigiba ng buhay. Ang tanging dasal po natin, sana’y magmalasakit din naman sila sa ating Unibersidad at sa ating komunidad.

Hindi po natin ikinahiya kailanman na tayo ay galing din sa hirap. Dala po ng kahirapan sa buhay tayo po ay nangailangang tumulong sa ating mga magulang sa pagtataguyod sa pamilya. Tumulong po tayo na magpa-aral sa ating mga kapatid upang magbago ang kanilang mga kapalaran at ng ating mga mahal sa buhay. Sa ating pagtulong, nangailangan pong humingi tayo ng awa sa Panginoon. At upang patunayan na ang ating panalangin ay taimtim, tayo po ay nagbitaw ng isang panata. Panata na tayo po ay hindi hahanap ng kabiyak sa buhay hanggat hindi natatapos ng kolehiyo ang lahat ng ating mga kapatid. Dininig po ng Maykapal ang ating panalangin at malugod naman po nating tinupad ang ating panata. Hindi po tayo nakipag-isang dibdib kay Atty. Gaby hanggat hindi po tapos ng medisina ang bunso nating kapatid.

Ngayong hapon, saksi kayong lahat at ang Dakilang Lumikha, tayo po ay gumagawa muli ng isang panata. Panata na tayo po ay maglilingkod ng wagas, sa sukdulan ng ating kakayahan, nang patas at makatarungan, nang buong puso at pagmamahal, nang walang iwanan at laglagan, at higit sa lahat, na walang halong biro!

Maraming salamat po sa inyong lahat!

Mabuhay and Unibersidad ng Pilipinas!

 

 

(The English translation of the Filipino portion follows below.)

 

Driven by the sincerest and noblest desire to continue accomplishing meaningful and necessary changes in the University, and with the firm belief that I could contribute to achieve this dream, I humbly offered myself to serve our University as its President. And because we were brought and bound together by our common selfless intentions and pursuits, we prevailed, we succeeded.

This success signals the beginning of the more important task of proving to our colleagues—friends and detractors alike—and to those who rely on and believe in us that we will fulfill and deliver the reforms we have committed to achieve. This we will realize through a renewal of our collective and united efforts to plan, decide, and act toward the needed change we have envisioned together.

For us to triumph, the three vital components of our University—the students, the faculty, and the administrative staff—should aim as one to hit our targets. Our unity is the key to our success. True, unity is elusive because we fully acknowledge and accept the complexity and diversity of our respective needs, beliefs, and standards. However, we believe that there is a common ground where all of the three components can stand together as one body. We have to act as one body, so that pain endured by one of us will be pain felt by all of us. That common ground is right here in our hearts; we simply have to feel it to realize it.

To ensure that all of us will stay in that common ground together as one, I, as your President, shall act as the adhesive that will keep us fastened and bound together, so that no one will fall out, or be left out.

I am committed to listen to anyone who needs my attention, so I would know what he or she feels, plans, and needs in order to guide me in my work. Under my leadership, the common good is far more important than my personal views or desire.

The road to change is treacherous to say the least. But to guide us in every step of the way, compassion is what shall set our bearings. It is compassion when we feel genuine care for our University, genuine care for our professions, genuine care for ourselves, and genuine care for each other. When we genuinely feel compassion, we are truly careful with our words and deeds; very careful of our every move so as not to hurt or harm the things we value and care for.

If our unity is the key to our success, compassion is the key to our solidarity and lasting camaraderie.

In the next six years that I will steer the helm of this administration, rest assured that I will hold it firmly and with vigilance, for there will be great obstacles ahead to confront and overcome. Just at the start of my term as President, we already met a major challenge: tuition-free college education.

It is a major concern because we have been allocating sixty percent of our collection from tuition fees for faculty development programs. If the national government will not replace the tuition collection we will forego, there will be no funds to finance the programs that develop and uplift the conditions of our faculty.

Apart from this, we have to address another concern. While studying in UP may be free, can the students belonging to the less-privileged and marginalized families pass the UPCAT if they intend or wish to study in UP?

The free-tuition program will clearly be pointless, senseless, and useless if the students from poor families will not pass the UPCAT. Based on previous studies, only a small percentage of graduates from public high schools outside Metro Manila pass the UPCAT. This low turnout is being blamed on the low quality of instruction in those public high schools.

This reality has given rise to our proposal to impose return service as a condition for the admission of students to UP. This return service will be for one year after graduation. Our graduates will be required to teach senior high school students in public high schools that we will identify as UP feeder schools. This scheme, we hope, will uplift the quality of the graduates from these feeder schools.

The return-service condition, however, will be voluntary. Any student may opt out from this condition before graduation by paying his tuition, or the cost of his education if he will opt out after graduation. The return service to be rendered by our graduates will not be for free. Our students who will decide to teach will be compensated properly.

While it is voluntary, we are very optimistic that our students, the scholars of the nation, will choose to render return service. That is because it will be a perfect opportunity for them to live out their professed love for our country, and their advocacy to serve our poor countrymen.

Our students often march on the streets to demand change. Sometimes it seems that their clamors and complaints will never end; that they want to run the University themselves; and that they wish to study as they please or solely what they desire.

Nevertheless, we shall guarantee their right and freedom to express their ideas, beliefs, and principles. We will never even attempt to suppress what they want to say, or oppress them for what they fight for. Instead, we shall listen to them, understand them, and guide them. We do not mold them to think one way or another. On the contrary, we mold them to think freely; to develop inquisitive, discerning, and creative minds; to be fearless and assertive; and to uphold what is right and just.

For our faculty, our strength lies in our ability to discourse and resolve our differences collegially. We will value and nurture this ability intensely. We will vigorously pursue and secure the funding needed to continue and improve our faculty development programs.

In order to retain our valued faculty in our University, we will study how to ease the rules on tenure and promotion to make them fair and just. We will also upgrade their working conditions and provide them with a happy and vibrant academic life in our campuses. After it burned down last year, a bigger, more modern, and faculty-friendly Faculty Center will rise up again in three years."
Danilo L. Concepción installed as 21st UP president – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/danilo-l-concepcion-installed-as-21st-up-president/,"


Atty. Danilo Lardizabal Concepción was formally installed as the 21st president of the University of the Philippines on September 20 at the University Theater, UP Diliman. He has been in office for seven months.

Commission on Higher Education Chairperson Patricia Licuanan, who heads the UP Board of Regents, presided over the investiture rites. As part of the ceremony, she handed over the symbols of the presidency such as the mace and medallion to Concepción.

Philippine Vice President Maria Leonor Robredo graced the event along with other government officials. President Rodrigo Roa Duterte had been invited but sent his regrets along with his “felicitations to the University and its new leadership.” Members of the diplomatic corps, National Artists, National Scientists, academic leaders, former UP presidents, and University officials from across the UP System were among those who attended the ceremony.

When Concepción was still a nominee, his vision sought to redefine UP’s culture, enhancing its time-honored traditions of honor and excellence to include “malasakit” or compassion—a virtue he considers as “UP’s moral core as the national university.”

In his investiture speech titled “Compassion, Our Common Ground,” he defined compassion as genuine care for UP, for the professions, and for each member of the University. “When we genuinely feel compassion, we are truly careful with our words and deeds; very careful of our every move so as not to hurt or harm the things we value and care for,” he said.

Speaking both in English and Filipino, the new UP President began by looking back at UP’s 109-year-long history and noting that while “dissent has been coded into the University’s DNA,” the current atmosphere of political polarization in the country and even the university had taken its toll on “truth, reason, and respect.” He called for the promotion of “consensus over conflict, civility over calumny, and collaboration over confrontation. We must foster strategic thinking over short-sightedness, honest labor over opportunism, and shared effort over self-promotion.”"

The University of the Philippines hosted on November 24, 2018, the first general assembly and forum of Akademyang Filipino, a gathering of the country’s thought leaders who aim to elevate the discourse on national issues. UP President Danilo Concepcion welcomed the Akademya’s trustees and members to the main auditorium of the UP Professional Schools in Bonifacio Global City, Taguig.

According to Concepcion, the promotion of service to the people and to the nation was an objective shared by the University and the Akademya. “We must foster strategic thinking over short-sightedness, honest labor over opportunism, and shared effort over self-promotion,” he said.

 

 

“Being among you I realize that I stand at the summit of Filipino intellectual, cultural, and moral achievement,” he said. Concepcion greeted the Akademya: beginning with trustee Justice Antonio Carpio; and followed by chairman emeritus and National Artist for Literature F. Sionil Jose; trustee and National Scientist Angel Alcala; chairman, former Ombudsman and Justice Conchita Carpio Morales; Trustee Felipe Gozon; and members, former Chief Justice Hilario Davide Jr., former Prime Minister Cesar Virata, and former UP President Emerlinda Roman.

Jose made an appeal for “self-transcendent leadership” in his tribute to Akademyang Filipino co-founder, former UP President and Senate President, Edgardo Angara. Morales addressed the assembly for the first time, calling for “curated information and curative information” for the people.

The public forum focused on defending Philippine sovereign rights in the West Philippine Sea. The Keynote speaker was Carpio who, in his speech, criticized Chinese sovereignty claims to areas of the South China Sea and the West Philippine Sea as false or fabricated. He explained how some of these areas are consistently part of historical maps of the Philippines and its zones of entitlements.

Carpio encouraged Filipinos to strongly and explicitly protest against the false claims, and to make politicians accountable, especially during elections, for their stand on the issue.

When he was younger, UP Integrated School (UPIS) 12th grader Adrian Jeremiah C. Bornilla would make it a point to go over the natural and earth science sections of the almanacs his family had at home. The boy found the topic endlessly fascinating, and it was no surprise that his parents, both engineers, would fill his and his siblings’ younger years with even more books on science and engineering.

Little did Adrian realize years later that his childhood interest would give honor to the country in his final year of secondary school. Together with fellow students Maria Janine Juachon (Philippine Science High School Central Luzon), Eugene Toribio (PSHS Bicol Region) and Mikhail Angel Torio (PSHS Main Campus), he represented the country as the lone UP representative in the 2017 International Earth Science Olympiad (IESO) in Cote d’Azur, France.

When the smoke cleared, the team had won two gold medals, three silvers and two bronzes at the IESO, a competition for secondary students that tests their skills in all areas of the Earth Sciences: geology, geophysics, meteorology, oceanography, terrestrial astronomy and environmental sciences. The competition is both practical and theoretical: participants are tested not only on their Earth Science knowledge, but also on their ability to conduct scientific investigations in the field.

Adrian first got wind of the competition when a letter from Bicol University arrived at the UPIS with the news that after a six-year absence, the Philippines intended to join the IESO once again. “Because France was this year’s host,” he explained, “they were able to waive the entrance fee for the Philippines.” Budgetary constraints had prevented the country from previously sending a team to the competition.

Adrian was chosen, together with another batchmate from the same track, to take part in the selection process, which took place in both Metro Manila and Bicol. As fate would have it, he would end up as the sole UP representative in the historic team of four.

Earth Science boot camp

After being selected, Adrian and his teammates were told to brush up on all pertinent areas of the Earth Sciences. This was the first step in a highly rigorous training process that saw them being taken under the wing of some of the world’s foremost experts in these fields.

“The first legitimate training sessions were held in Bicol,” Adrian noted. Here, the world-renowned former volcanologist and Pinatubo expert Dr. Chris Newhall, formerly of the US Geological Survey, trained the team in field methods. They spent a total of five days in Legaspi City, mastering various Earth Science topics. In addition, the team also received astronomy pointers from famous physicist Dr. Reinabelle Reyes, the Filipina who helped confirm Einstein’s Theory of Relativity on a cosmic scale back in 2010."
The Giant Artworks that Define Us – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/the-giant-artworks-that-define-us/,"


A wreath of flame. An awe-inspiring conch shell. If you have been a religious attendee of UP Diliman’s year-end celebrations over the past few years, you might have noticed a distinct change in the artistic installations people are used to seeing in the University’s Oblation Plaza.

Everyone from nostalgic alumni to casual visitors have most likely marveled at the keen attention to detail and the rich symbolism that characterize the massive themed structures in front of Quezon Hall over the past few Decembers. At the heart of these displays are the giant lanterns enfolding the Oblation—UP’s most iconic figure—that give a meaningful and otherworldly beauty to events like the Pag-iilaw and the Lantern Parade.

Famously designed by UP artist Toym Imao, these figures serve as concrete representations of the overall Celebration themes—themes that define UP Diliman’s identity and purpose in contemporary Philippine society. But what do they mean, exactly, and what is the process that goes into making the themes that inspire them?

“The year-end celebration is a reminder and a celebration of the good things that UP Diliman contributed to the community—to the nation, and even to the world,” says Dr. Sir Anril Pineda Tiatco, the celebrated dramaturg, scholar, and director of the UP Diliman Information Office (DIO), one of a select core of artists who convene yearly to develop the year-end theme celebrating UPD’s important national role.

Tiatco and colleagues DIO Deputy Director Jem Javier, UP Theater Complex (UPTC) Director Jose Estrella, and UPTC Technical Director Barbie Tan-Tiongco come together as early as August to exchange ideas on both the theme and the central image for the installation. By the time the UPD Committee on Year-End is constituted a month later, the group is more than ready to present their initial ideas.

“As soon as the committee approves the theme and the image, we immediately discuss them with the artist,” Tiatco says. “Imao provides a series of studies. We talk about his studies until we come up with something – a compromised version, in a way.” Some important constraints on the final output, he notes, are: (a) a tight budget, (b) comprehensibility (can the community relate to the piece?), and (c) aesthetics. The last can be a tricky variable to navigate, especially when different artists can have different visions and creative backgrounds to inform them.

“I remember in 2016, it took three weeks before we finally used Himig ng Diliman as our central theme. Originally, we wanted to use Tipunin ang mga Tinig, but we thought it was uninteresting and not indicative of how UP Diliman should present itself to the public”.

The end-results of these long discussions, however, are now storied parts of UP Diliman’s history.

The debut year for Tiatco and his colleagues was 2015. It featured the year-end theme Dingas (spark), which celebrated, according to Chancellor Michael Tan, UP Diliman’s role as a spark and facilitator of national discourse. Capturing this ideal was the installation Sulo (torch), which saw the Oblation surrounded by sparks of molded steel and plastic. In-between the space between the sparks were three bamboo triangles representing the islands of Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.

“In a way the dingas or spark is a testament to UPD’s character as a trailblazer,” Tiatco says, “but subtly it is also a reminder to be careful because others are there to follow. It is a reminder of our social, political, cultural and even moral duties. I believe that ‘spark’ is both exciting and daunting.”"

Biologist and informatics expert Joeriggo Reyes. (Photo by El Bacani, UP MPRO)

 

Sitting alone in an office built for two, Joeriggo Reyes may not appear at first to be part of a multidisciplinary team tackling one of the world’s deadliest diseases. The lab gowns or sequencing machines that one typically associates with biological scholarship are nowhere in sight. From his room at UP Diliman’s Institute of Mathematics, however, this biologist and informatics expert finds himself at the crossroads of contemporary cancer research.

As the lead builder of the scientific database for a CHED-Philippine California Advanced Research Institute (PCARI)-funded project, Reyes’ office is the convergence point for data produced by four groups from the Philippines and the US. Once done, it will house information from laboratories in UP Los Baños, the University of California Davis, UP Diliman, and the Lung Center of the Philippines.

These researchers—united more by a common vision and fiber optic cables than physical proximity—are using their expertise in systems biology, medicine and chemistry to unlock the secrets of lung cancer, a disease that claims ten Filipinos per hour, according to the World Health Organization.

While building a freely accessible storehouse for researchers sounds like the least glamorous part of the job, Reyes finds his role perhaps the most reflective of how 21st-century science can be done.

Scientists today are increasingly relying on large data sets to bring together previously isolated subjects, and to model the interacting components that make up complex phenomena like cancer.
At the heart of these efforts is the database—where researchers can access massive amounts of data uploaded by their peers and predecessors to solve previously intractable problems. Reyes hopes the repository he is building will not only benefit his fellow project proponents, but other scientists working towards the next generation of breakthroughs in Philippine biomedical research.

 

What is a database?

While a project that marries biology and information technology can sound daunting, describing a database in itself is fairly straightforward. “A simple example of a database is a Microsoft Excel file,” says Reyes. “In an Excel file, you have rows and you have columns. And in these you have attributes like people’s names and birthdays. That’s a simple database, and we just work to make more complex ones.”

These more complex databases have now become staples of increasingly multi-part and sophisticated biological research. One example is the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) of the US National Institutes of Health, with its BLAST algorithm.

“BLAST connects to the repository of all the genetic data of the NCBI,” Reyes explains. “Different institutions from the US, Japan and Europe formed a consortium to ensure that whatever data they have is available to the outside world.  So, everyone’s seeing the same thing.”

In principle, whenever an experimenter from anywhere in the world sequences a gene (or a genome), one can always use BLAST to look up similar ones within the database. “That way,” Reyes says, “you can identify your gene or your protein, or make an intelligent guess as to its structure or function.” The process applies even to other types of molecular data, such as mass spectrometry fingerprints for proteins and metabolites.

 

A many-part machine

The need for an in-house database that is comprehensive and easy to use becomes obvious, given the scale and complexity of Reyes’s project. Communicating mostly over Skype, each of his fellow researchers in the Glycoproteomics of Filipino Lung Cancer Cell Lines for Biomarker Discovery and Anti-Cancer Screening of Natural Products team makes unique data contributions, working autonomously on components that, in sum, contributes to the achievement of broader aims.

In total, the project lays the foundation for future research that will allow clinicians to profile a patient and tell, in the shortest time possible, whether he or she has lung cancer, and what therapeutic regimen might be most effective. It will also help us develop drugs that target multiple genes, tailored specifically to the local population.

One component of the project, headed by Dr. Francisco Heralde of the Lung Center of the Philippines, will collect tumor tissue and blood samples from Filipino lung cancer patients, and establish cell lines for them.

Why is this important? Reyes says the majority of work done on lung cancer so far has used European and American samples. “We have our own sets of mutations, our own genetic profile.” And these samples will both help establish if Filipinos do indeed have unique cancer biomarkers, and help clarify how we might respond differently to therapies, given these profiles.

In another component, researchers will be using techniques offered by the UC Davis laboratory of Dr.  Carlito Lebrilla, an expert in glycosylation—the attachment of carbohydrates to molecules like proteins. Some of these “glycoproteins” in turn perform functions vital to the cell, such as sending and receiving signals."

Dubbed as the “Tau Alpha Infinity Walk”, this legacy project coincides with the fraternity’s 90th anniversary celebrations and will benefit the UP Diliman community as well as the visitors of the campus. The project features a promenade or walkway across the lagoon, a plaza for showcasing artworks and cultural activities, tunnels with vaulted ceilings, and rockscape and waterworks that complement the biodiversity and enhance the natural beauty of the lagoon. The completed project will be turned over to UP in 2022.

President Norberto P. Mendoza of the Tau Alpha Foundation said this legacy project would benefit the entire UP community. Chairperson Antonio A. Turalba, Sr. of the Tau Alpha Legacy Project Committee said they presented their conceptual plan and Memorandum of Agreement to UP officials in May and these were approved by the UP Board of Regents in June 2019. He said their design took into consideration the biodiversity in the lagoon to enhance the area, preserve trees and plants, and continue to attract migratory birds. He added that everyone could be proud of the project, as it was also the fraternity’s way of giving back to UP, the institution that had molded them into who they are today.

January 4, 2019 | Written by J. Mikhail Solitario



Did you know that next to rice, the second biggest industry in agriculture is pig or swine farming? And that in this industry, the latest data show that at least seven out of ten pig farmers are involved in backyard pig farming?

Backyard pig farmers are not as well-equipped as their industry-grade counterparts who operate in large tracts of land with tools, equipment, and techniques backed by up-to-date research. Instead, backyard pig farmers rely on their own strategies in raising their own pig farms. Most of these strategies have been passed down one generation to the next in a family.

This potential piqued the interest of Dr. Lyre Espada Murao, Associate Professor at the College of Science and Mathematics in UP Mindanao, who is also part of the University’s Balik PhD program. “There’s a gap that we can fill in as a scientist. What can we do to help them [pig farmers]? Being in the field of infectious diseases, we thought this was something we could bring to the table for them,” Dr. Lyre recalls.

According to her TEDx profile, Dr. Murao “teaches anything micro from molecules to microbes and cells but once outside the classroom, she goes hunting for nasty viruses.” This hunt led her to ask the local city veterinarian for data on backyard pig farmers. Her team found out that the local vet had a list of less than 10 backyard pig farmers which did not seem to add up, given Davao City’s expansive area. After reaching out to farmers’ organizations, veterinarians, and technical experts, they were able to zero in on four major districts: Tugbok, Calinan, Bunawan, and Toril. Dr. Lyre and her team went around to survey all the barangays and were able to obtain a comprehensive list of more than 800 farmers.

 

Crafting the study design

The next step was to obtain formal permission from the local government to conduct research on pig farms with the backyard pig farmers. The particular research is done in collaboration with Dr. Pete Alviola and his students from UP Mindanao’s School of Management. They crunch the numbers and data, while Lyre takes care of the biological aspect of the study. The main focus is to identify existing management practices and integrate new strategies in terms of managing diseases to help improve the overall economics of the farms.

Education as liberation of the poor

“For me, I associate education as liberation of the poor,” an animated John Gaisano recalls as he tells the story of how a UP in Mindanao was established. Gaisano, of the famed chain of shopping malls owned by his family, sees the ripple or multiplier effect of how a University of the Philippines campus right in the heartland can alleviate poverty. He illustrates this by citing actual stories from graduates of UP Mindanao. “We have about a thousand graduates, and when they go home to their hometowns, what do you think is in their mind? Of course they want to help their younger siblings. From 800 graduates, you now have about 1,600. And when they get married and have kids, where do they send their kids to? UP.” According to Gaisano, the typical UP Mindanao student is one with parents who may be laborers, farmworkers, or (street) vendors. Gaisano proposes that a UP education may help break the cycle of poverty. Mindanao, after all, has the country’s highest poverty rates. “UP is supposed to be helping the country, but why is it not here in the poorest regions?” Gaisano posed the question.

Gaisano said that in the campaign to have a UP campus in Mindanao, he and his colleagues had to reach out to members of Congress, from senators to representatives. They found out that the Senate that time had a lot of UP alumni. “Actually, you know, it’s like you start a ripple in the water. You keep doing it until it creates a small wave, then a big wave. Now, will it ever happen? We don’t know that but we cannot think it cannot be done. The moment you think it cannot be done, you will stop doing and it will never happen,” he declares.

After relentless campaigning, the establishment of UP Mindanao was realized during the term of Philippine president Ramos, seeing the light of day during the term of UP President Emil Javier. However, many other hurdles still had to be overcome. During the term of President Macapagal-Arroyo, then House Speaker Nograles told Gaisano that the amount requested for the UP Mindanao budget was too large to be given under one General Appropriations Act. It could only be through appropriation distributed across three to five fiscal years.

Working from the ground up

A university must have at least three colleges before it can be called one. To do this, some capital had to be injected to UP Mindanao. Gaisano along with alumni Angie Angliongto led a series of successful fundraising activities and solicitation of donations. He envisioned UP Mindanao to be a center of expertise when it comes to managing natural resources, such as land, mining, agriculture, and the seas. Gaisano initiated the establishment of the UP Mindanao Foundation, separate from the UPAA Davao, with the goal of encouraging UP faculty from other UP universities to come to UP Mindanao. Later on, the UPMF also extended their financial assistance to the poorest students.

During one fund raising event, he remembers sharing a very small table with then Senate President Angara and then UP President Javier to meet with donors who were mostly UP alumni. Gaisano suggested the roles: he would talk about the relevance of having UP in Mindanao, Javier talked in detail how this would benefit businesses in Mindanao, and finally Angara would deliver the punchline. The board of UPMF also decided not to touch the principals of the donations, and instead just use the interest as operating funds to grant financial aid.

With features at par with world-class standards, they are expected to boost sports not only in the University but in the entire country as well where there is a lack of sports venues available to the public.

First to be constructed for the UP Diliman Sports Complex is the football stadium. Several tons of dirt were hauled to the site to raise, level, and compact the grounds. An intricate drainage system was then constructed for the facility. The artificial turf for the football field has passed rigorous certification by FIFA. Soon to rise are outdoor lighting and the grandstand.

"UPEEEI Tech Fair Celebrates Engineering Innovation, Education and Collaboration – University of the Philippines",https://up.edu.ph/upeeei-tech-fair-celebrates-engineering-innovation-education-and-collaboration/,"


For one day on May 24, faculty, researchers, students and staff of the UP Diliman Electrical and Electronics Engineering Institute (UP EEEI) left their laboratories and classrooms to hold the institution’s first Technology Fair at the UP Professional Schools, Bonifacio Global City.

The Technology Fair brought together representatives from private IT companies, government agencies and organizations, and other universities as part of its objective to engage state universities and colleges, government agencies, and industry partners in advancing the Electrical, Electronics, and Computer Engineering fields in the Philippines by setting the platform for collaboration; hence its theme, “Towards a New Century of Innovative and Visionary Engineering Research and Education.”

The Technology Fair also held a poster-session and an exhibit of the latest projects and research outputs of the different research laboratories under the UPEEEI. As Dr. John Richard Hizon, director of the UPEEEI, said during his welcoming remarks: “To end our centennial celebration by acknowledging the work of our faculty, researchers, students and staff is a good starting point in defining our institute’s new direction.”

In the first part of the program, two representatives from government—Dr. Maridon Sahagun, Director of the Department of Science and Technology Planning and Evaluation Services and Dr. William Padolina, Executive Director of the Philippine-California Advanced Research Institutes (PCARI) under the Commission on Higher Education—delivered messages on behalf of the DOST and the CHED, respectively.

Sahagun congratulated the UPEEEI for continuing to be one of the DOST’s most active and productive collaborators in the implementation of its projects as well as the recipients of grants for DOST research and human development programs, such as: the Engineering Research and Development for Technology (ERDT) Program; the establishment of the Philippine Institute for Integrated Circuits (PIIC); and, the “Development of Philippine Scientific Earth Observation Microsatellite” or PHL-Microsat Program, known as Diwata 1 and Diwata 2. The PHL-Microsat Program, a collaborative research program of UP Diliman through the UPEEEI and the DOST-Advanced Science and Technology Institute, aims to build, launch and effectively utilize the Philippines’ first micro-satellite for multi-spectral, high precision earth observation.

Sahagun also noted that the DOST and the UPEEEI are both working toward highlighting the importance of partnerships in nurturing the innovative capacities of the various sectors in a science, technology and innovation ecosystem, a strategy contained in the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) for 2017-2020. Chapter 14 of the PDP, she said, was dedicated to advancing science, technology and innovation by increasing R&D expenditure from only 0.14 percent in 2013 to 0.5 percent by the end of 2022, and by increasing the number of scientists, researchers and engineers produced per million population from 270 currently to 300 by 2020. The DOST is also aggressively pursuing programs to accelerate technology production and stimulate innovation in the next six years by: improving S&T infrastructure; enhancing the R&D capacities of our institutions, especially those in the regions; increasing technology transfer; and, strengthening partnerships with industry and other stakeholders, among others.

Padolina informed the audience of the available programs under CHED that it was hoped would enhance interaction between industry and academe. He presented an overview of the Philippine higher education landscape, and presented CHED’s efforts to upgrade the capacity for directed R&D extension programs to serve socio-economic goals, particularly in the five high-priority areas of food security, environment and disaster risk reduction, marine resources, smart analytics and engineering innovations, health systems, and education for STEAM (science, technology, engineering, agriculture, math). As part of its promotion of academe-industry linkages in terms of translating industry needs into HEI curricula, the CHED is also exerting efforts to develop or reinstate courses such as: BS Meteorology, BS Business Analytics, BS Business Entertainment and Multimedia Computing, BS Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering, and so on. On the other hand, the current industry-academe partnerships that the CHED has been monitoring in the HEIs are on-the-job training, graduate placement, and an early stage of collaboration in R&D by looking at joint R&D programs and commissioned research, technology licensing and spin-off companies.

For faculty members who no longer have a teaching load due to the K-12 transition, they are given grants for them to pursue higher degrees and engage with industry partners through research and hired technical services. Padolina also mentioned the PCARI project, which aims to enhance the capacity of Philippine HEIs for R&D that translates to technological innovations that would address societal projects. Finally, Padolina cited several critical concerns for higher education, including: talent development and the job-skills mismatch; the lack of industry relevant knowledge in terms of curricular issues; the lack of skilled labor; the generally low quality of instruction in HEIs; and, the need to strengthen our technology delivery and extension system so that the research output of our scientists and researchers would benefit small and medium enterprises, especially those in the regions.

Later in the day, Mr. Lowell Tortona, head of Nokia’s 5g R&D arm in the Philippines, gave a talk on the Internet of Things (IOT) and 5G. 5G stands for fifth generation wireless connection standard, which is based on the IEEE 802.11ac standard of broadband technology, and is built to keep up with the proliferation of devices that need a mobile internet connection. These range from communication and computing devices, to household appliances, medical equipment, vehicles, public safety and transport systems, and factory equipment—the so-called “Internet of Things”. The development of 5G connectivity is the hot topic abroad. It will, however, take time to reach the Philippines, but will enable greater connectivity, responsiveness, reliability, efficiency and even greater environmental protection in areas such as smart industry, smart healthcare, smart home and utilities, smart cities, public safety, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV).

Later in the afternoon, three parallel sessions were held to discuss in greater depth the research being conducted by the UPEEEI’s laboratories and research collaborations with private industries. These parallel sessions were classified according to topic: “Technologies to Harness Renewable Energy” chaired by Assistant Professor Lew Andrew Tria; “Technologies to Enable Internet of Things” chaired by Dr. Rhandley Cajote; and “Enabling Communication Networks” chaired by Assistant Professor Paul Jason Co.

The Stories of the Old Trees of UPD – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/the-stories-of-the-old-trees-of-upd/,"


Trees are silent, and many, like hermits, are dying lonely and unseen. But their silence is deceptive, for they have stories to tell. Much of UP is trees. And trees remain UP’s most widespread physical legacy to Diliman, a vast denuded estate overlooking Marikina valley.

Acacias, the traditional choice for public spaces since they were brought in during the early days of Spanish rule, were the first trees planted after the transfer of UP to Diliman in the late 1940s. The hard adobe grounds had to be blasted to allow them to take root. Since then, they have spoken eloquently of UP Diliman’s fast and robust growth. Now larger-than-life, acacias hold sway at the academic center, providing shade where there was once only grassland.

But they are also like UP and the country’s colonial past; dominant and lingering, roots long and winding, beautiful and scary at the same time; and as an exotic species, forever imposed, a stranger to the land.

But theirs was not the beginning story.

A few had come before them, and continue to live. A sampaloc and two mango trees at the site of the Arboretum came without design, survived the aridness of the landscape, and the Japanese-American War.

There is no account of their histories, except that they, like acacias, are exotic. But together with the native agoho in front of Quezon Hall, which an old hand in the transfer of UP to Diliman recalled being planted before Christmas 1949, they have seen more of campus life than all the acacias surviving to this day.

They are forgotten trees. Despite being at the campus portal, the agoho has had no alumnus taking selfies beside it as it stands beside a creek, quietly enduring the thin topsoil, the constructions, many fires, the barricading of Diliman’s iconic building. The tallest tree in the area, it is hidden by bulkier trees, broken, and wasting away.

 

The agoho tree said to be the oldest tree on main campus. (Photo by Jo. Lontoc, UP MPRO)

 

At the Arboretum, the stories of War and growth of an urban forest are replaced by the story of encroaching urban blight. The roots of one mango tree are now covered by growing mounds of garbage. It nearly died from a treasure hunt digging. The other tree broke in the middle from a typhoon and has become a dump for old bottles. The mighty roots of the sampaloc are laid bare by eroding forces of water, wind, wheels, and feet.

The acacias have contemporaries within and outside the Oval. Many now tell the story of holding on for dear life.

The camachile, for example, another exotic species, insists on a foothold at several sites on campus. Most would be familiar with the four ones lining Velasquez Street. One had been cut close to the base, but from the large gnarly stump, a new crown has sprouted. Two had fallen from typhoons but from the fallen trunk, several more trunks arose. Same is true for the camachiles at the parking lot of the Alumni Center, and behind the Gymnasium and DMST complexes.

The native ones, like the bitaog, are proving to be hardier. Most visible to freshman applicants would be the dark imposing silhouette up Kalaw street. Its fan-like breadth tells a story. It is one of being cut at the top early in life and being forced to grow laterally, well over to the other side of the street, where the Registrar’s stands.

The bitaog on the eastern side of the campus does not enjoy the same space to spread its branches. It is pruned regularly to stay clear of the facade of Malcolm Hall, the mirror building of Benitez Hall, the two pre-war buildings on campus. In old pictures, the bitaog is a distinct growth by the driveway, growing alongside the acacia saplings at the Oval. It sheltered the first nurses from UP until the college had to move to UP Manila. The lawyers from UP would surely remember it, as it has gazed over the entrance since all the living of them could remember.

At Gonzalez Hall, three towering dungon trees in a row, facing the Sunken Garden, remain steadfast sentinels, guarding over the knowledge seekers on the floors and, once, when the Beach House was in business, food-hunters at their feet.

Right at a corner of the Sunken Garden, boughs wistfully bending over toward the grass, the grand calumpit tree has been witness to countless pageants and parades of the past and the youthful revelry of games and UP Fairs of the present.

The University of the Philippines in Mindanao saw its biggest batch of graduates so far at its 21st Commencement Exercises, held on June 26, 2018 at the Atrium of the Administration Building in Mintal, Davao City.

UP Mindanao Class of 2018 numbered 250, and produced eight magna cum laudes, including valedictory speaker and BS Computer Science graduate Cherrie Me Andrea E. Sun, and 59 cum laude graduates. This brings UP Mindanao’s total number of graduates to date to 3,072, according to Chancellor Sylvia B. Concepcion. In her message, the chancellor reminded this year’s crop of iskolar ng bayan: “It is your turn to pay forward through service to the Filipino people.” She added that the graduates, through their own example and exemplary practice, should “strengthen the belief among fellow Mindanawons that it is in quality education in UP Mindanao that the true path to a state of empowerment can be discerned.”

Joining the graduates was Department of Science and Technology (DOST) Secretary Fortunato T. de la Peña, who was conferred a Doctor of Laws degree, honoris causa, by UP President Danilo Concepcion at the event. Secretary de la Peña was UP System vice-president for Planning and Development when the original committee was constituted in August 1994 to study the feasibility of establishing a UP campus in Mindanao. Dela Peña was a member of that committee. In his commencement address, he regaled the audience with his recollections of UP Mindanao’s history. He recalled how then UP President Emil Q. Javier and Davao Congressman Elias Lopez pushed for the bill to establish UP Mindanao, leading to the signing of Republic Act 7889, formally creating UP Mindanao on February 20, 1995.

Sec. de la Peña also reminisced about having his picture taken with the first student dormers in UP Mindanao, UP Mindanao’s first commencement exercise in 1997 held for its first batch of Master of Management and Master of Urban and Regional Planning graduates, and the Bago Oshiro campus which had been part of the Bureau of Plant Industry, and the present campus in Tugbok, previously occupied by the 52nd Engineering Brigade of the AFP. He gave credit to the UP alumni of Davao who were instrumental in the establishment of UP’s sixth campus and who also established the UP Mindanao Foundation, Inc.; as well as to UP Mindanao’s pioneering faculty, including its first Chancellor Rogelio Cuyno, Prof. Marcy Dans Lee, Dr. Dulce Flores who established UP Mindanao’s Food Technology program, and Vice-Chancellor for Academic Affairs Nilo Oponda. Finally, Sec. de la Peña also cited several prominent products of UP Mindanao, including Palanca awardee Errol A. Merquita, Davao City Counselor Antoinette Principe, doctorate degree-holder in Mathematics and UP Mindanao faculty member, Dr. Ritchie May Gamot, DOST Region XI Director Anthony Sales, and DOST Director in Compostela Valley Kenneth Barroga.

Aside from recalling UP Mindanao’s history, Sec. de la Peña also shared his own experiences as a fresh UP Chemical Engineering graduate starting out in the world to work. He passed on some lessons he learned from his experiences. First, if you’ve found the job you want to do or need to shift careers, it is best to do it before the age of 30. Second, be clear about your definition of success. And third, if the opportunity to do what you love presents itself—no matter how challenging it may seem at first—always say yes.

Finally, Sec. de la Peña also briefly described the current national administration’s thrusts toward promoting science and technology and the DOST’s programs, all of which aim to reduce inequality at every level, and to create new opportunities, whether in technopreneurship, capacity-building, or through DOST scholarships.

Cherrie Me Andrea E. Sun, who received the Chancellor’s Medal for Academic Excellence, urged her fellow graduates to continue to uphold what it means to be an iskolar ng bayan. “As iskolar ng bayan, we should go the extra mile. No matter where you are in life by that time—be it the manager of a big company, a village doctor, a volunteer or a government officer—remember our calling. Remember our mission. More than collecting memories that will put a smile on your face, use your abilities, serve the people, in order to collect the memories of the smiling faces of your countrymen. And we can do it together.”   (Celeste Llaneta, UP MPRO)

West Visayas is designated Region 6. Its lingua franca is Hiligaynon, but unknown to many, there are more speakers of Kinaray-a than of Hiligaynon. Kinaray-a in its many variants is spoken in all of Antique, all the southern coastal towns and central towns of Iloilo, and all the towns and hinterlands of Capiz. Aklanon, likewise in its various versions, is spoken in all the provinces of Aklan.

Sadly, people usually lump these languages together as Hiligaynon. Worse, Kinaray-a and Aklanon are labeled as dialects, as if they were not capable of expressing the best in the minds and hearts of their users.

The Mother Language

The mother language of West Visayas is Kinaray-a. It must have been the language of the ten Bornean datus believed to be the ancestors of the West Visayans as recorded in the Maragtas and Panay epics. The ten noblemen allegedly got the island of Aninipay (the ancient name of Panay) from the Ati chief Marikudo in exchange for a headgear of gold and a necklace that touched the ground.

Hiligaynon developed through the Chinese of Molo, Iloilo’s Chinatown. It is an early example of how colonial mentality works and how economic and cultural power can shape the language of power. The natives spoke Kinaray-a but instead of forcing the Chinese who controlled commerce to master the language of the place, it was the natives who accommodated the linguistic deficiencies of the foreigners. Thus the r in wara (none or zero), daraga (young woman), harigi (post), uring (charcoal), parigos (to take a bath), etc. became wala, dalaga, haligi, uling, paligos, etc.

As Hiligaynon developed into a language of the elite, Kinaray-a lost its position and dignity as the mother language. It became associated with the soiled workingman of the farms and the highlands, of the vulgar and uneducated, of the muchacha and the sakada.

Meanwhile, Aklanon also developed from Kinaray-a without Chinese acculturation. The most peculiar aspect of the language is its exotic /l/ sound. The so-called normal in Aklan, ulo (head), balay (house), dalaga (young woman), etc. is sounded with the tip of the tongue touching the upper teeth—Akean, ueo, baeay, daeaga, etc. There are words that have the normal /l/, but only Aklanons know them. The Hiligaynon bala (the Tagalog and Cebuano ba) is baea, but bullet is bala, not baea. The provincial capital is Kalibo, not Kaeibo, and there are towns like Balete, not Baeete, and Malinao, not Maeinao.

The folk explanation for this is that Datu Bangkaya, the Bornean who appropriated for his territory the present province of Aklan, had a speech defect. He had a short tongue, and he lisped. So that their chief would not feel abnormal in his speech, his followers imitated his mangling of the /l/ sound.

 

 

The Engineering

The 1986 EDSA revolution is a milestone in the literary history of West Visayas and the country. Three new writings emerged in the region: Kinaray-a, Aklanon and Visayan-influenced Filipino.

It started with the new management of the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP), which encouraged the establishment of local art councils; subsidized conferences, workshops and publications; and awarded writing grants and venue grants at the National Arts Center (NAC) on Mt. Makiling. The first writing workshop I directed as CCP literature coordinator for West Visayas was at UP Visayas in 1987. The following year, the Sumakwelan, the association of Hiligaynon writers, won a venue grant at the NAC, with me directing the writing workshop.

 

Poem included in the original March 29, 2000 issue.

 

In the group were two writers from Antique—Ma. Milagros C. Geremia, a research assistant at UP Visayas’ Center for West Visayan Studies, and Alex C. de los Santos, a former student of UP Visayas and then a senior English major at St. Anthony’s College. Like any other Kinaray-a speaking writer before them, the two never thought of writing in their home language. Then during one of the discussions, I asked them: Why don’t you write in Kinaray-a?

And they did. After the workshops, they swamped me with poems, all written in Antique Kinaray-a. I found them very good, some in fact extremely good. The two eventually formed Antique’s first ever writers’ group which they called Tabig."

The Cultural Center of the Philippines’ (CCP) Tanghalang Nicanor Abelardo was filled with orchestral music, then applause and cheers as the Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra (PPO) performed in a tribute concert to the late Senator Edgardo Angara on October 17.

Presented by the CCP and the PPO Society, Inc. (PPOSI) in cooperation with UP, the invitational event celebrated the life and work of the former Senate and UP president, particularly his affinity for and contributions to Philippine arts and culture.

In the opening program, CCP President Arsenio Lizaso described Angara as “a champion who believed that every Filipino deserves to experience the arts.”

Angara served four terms as senator, during which he authored and supported legislation that created the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA), and the National Living Treasures Award, as well as established the Book Publishing Industry Act, National Museum Act of 1998, National Book Development Trust Fund, and the National Cultural Heritage Act of 2009. At the end of his last senate term in 2013, Angara was awarded the Dangal ng Haraya by the NCCA in recognition of the impact and value of his work on the culture and arts of the country.

Even before his entry into the Philippine Senate, when he was still UP president, Angara formed the PPOSI to help CCP’s resident orchestra. It took care of the procurement and upkeep of instruments, and provided new uniforms annually for the members.

According to PPOSI President Zenaida Tantoco, Angara set up gratuity funds for retiring orchestra members. Just six months before his untimely passing, he gave study grants to two PPO members. One was to attend a master class in the United States and the other, to pursue a PhD in Music at UP Diliman.

Two glass sculptures were presented to the Angara family during the opening program. The first was “Eternal Flame” by Ramon Orlina, who was inspired by Angara’s unstinting support for the arts. Impy Pilapil created the other sculpture, an interpretation of the natural world’s dynamism and mystery.

UPCIS marks 10 years of short-visit program with Japanese universities – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/upcis-marks-10-years-of-short-visit-program-with-japanese-universities/,"


The University of the Philippines Diliman, through the UP Center for International Studies (UPCIS), marked this February ten years of a student-and-faculty short-visit program with Japanese universities by welcoming some 13 students and faculty from Ferris University and Yokohama National University (YNU), both located in the port city of Yokohama, south of Tokyo, and the Wayo Women’s University, located southeast of Tokyo.

Two groups of students in UPCIS — the Asian Emporium (Southeast Asia 30) and the Japanese Culture and Society 1 (Japanese Studies 101) classes — welcomed the Japanese visitors on February 26, 2019 in a combined class session during which students from both countries made oral presentations on a contemporary issue of global importance.

The visiting students were: Rika Yamamoto, Momoka Yamamoto and Hina Okubo (Ferris University); Miho Marutake, Ayumi Oguro, Zhong Liuyin, Liu Xiangfu, Cao Songwan, Pierre Kilele, Mika Kimura, Ayaka Iwasaki and Kiyoka Ebina (YNU); and Yukino Osada (Wayo Women’s University).

Three of the students were Chinese and one was Congolese.

 

Joint class discussions of SEA 30 and JS 101; together with students from Ferris University, Yokohama National University, and Wayo Women’s University at the U.P. Center for International Studies held on February 26, 2019.

 

Accompanying them were Profs. Chiho Ogaya and Masako Suginohara of Ferris University; Profs. Hiromi Kabashima and Takaaki Kobayashi of YNU, and Prof. Yuji Kanamaru of Wayo Women’s University.

The Japanese students talked about environmental awareness issues and student life in Japan, while their Filipino hosts discussed life as a UP student and Solid Waste Management practices in the Philippines. They later conducted small focus group discussions on specific topics earlier prepared in consultation with the two professors-in-charge and initiators of the short-visit program, Profs. Amparo Adelina Umali, III of UPCIS and Ogaya.

In November 19-29, 2018, five students from the Global Studies 197 (GS 197) Special Topics Course on Japanese Traditional Performance Practice (JTPP), a class offered at the UPCIS, visited Yokohama and Tokyo to participate in the 3rd Ferris University Short Stay Visit/Exchange Program.

The students were: Timothy Earl Castillon (BS Public Administration), Nikki Rae Rallos (BS Food Technology), Leo Niel Jasper Sese (BA European Languages), Crizel Ruth Ghelmae Ricaro, (BS Food Technology), and Alanis Zeta (B Fine Arts).

Accompanying them were UPCIS staff Maria Fe Lafuente and UPCIS lecturer and Noh Theater Ensemble founding member Danielle Naomi Uy.

Uy, an MS Human Movement Science student and currently a PE teacher in the university, studied Noh intensively for three months and performed at the Nagoya Noh Theatre for her recital as a recipient of the East Asia Network of Exchange for Students and Youths (JENESYS) Programme: Invitation Programme for Creators (2007/2008) through the Government of Japan and the Japan Foundation.

She also received a one-year grant from the student exchange program (2008/2009) of the UP System, which allowed her to study Nihongo and Japanese culture at Kyushu University while pursuing Noh training with Noh Grand Master Shigeji Omura.

The visiting students from UPCIS were recipients of the Japan’s Ministry of Education Culture and Science’s Japan Student Services (JASSO) Short Stay Scholarship for International Students, which allows student-participants to join discussions, attend lectures by professors, and visit remarkable Japanese sites. Ogaya and Umali served as faculty advisers of the program.

Umali is a Japanese literature and traditional theater performance scholar who obtained her PhD from Doshisha University in Kyoto, Japan.  She is also the UPCIS Coordinator for East and Southeast Asian Studies and the founder and artistic director of two UP-based Japanese theater performance groups, the UPCIS Noh Ensemble and the UPCIS Bunraku Ensemble.

Noh is an ancient elite theater tradition in Japan that developed in the 14th century and Bunraku is the traditional puppet theater that began in the 17th century.

Ogaya is a Ferris University-based sociologist who does research work on Japanese-Filipino families and Filipino OFWs in Japan.  She was a faculty of the YNU when she and Umali started the short-visit program in 2009.

The two started the program in 2009, during the terms of Prof. Cynthia Neri Zayas as UPCIS officer-in-charge, Dr. Sergio Cao as UP Diliman Chancellor under whose office the UPCIS is attached, and now professor emerita Emerlinda Roman as UP President. Two years later, UPCIS students received funding from JASSO to travel to Japan and visit YNU.

The short-visit program has been implemented with assistance from JASSO and, occasionally, of the UP Mobility for Vigor and Excellence (MOVE-UP) Short Stay Scholarship for International Students.

The funding has enabled members of the UPCIS Noh Ensemble and the UPCIS Bunraku Ensemble — mostly students from the UPCIS-offered Japanese Traditional Performance Practice class — to come to Japan every November and have hands-on training sessions with grand masters of Noh in Tokyo and women Bunraku culture bearers in Naoshima."

The science is in. Getting high on sports is a good thing, especially if you’re a teenager.

Studies have shown the many benefits of engaging in sports for young people. Adolescents who participate in sports are more physically fit, have better mental health, tend to do better in school, and are less likely to engage in risky behavior.

Research has also shown that people who play high school sports tend to get better jobs with higher salaries later in life. More importantly, sports instills qualities that will enable them to become productive citizens—hard work, self-discipline, commitment, leadership and time management skills, and the so-called “3 Ps”: persistence, patience and practice.

UP is mandated to develop these qualities among its students by undertaking comprehensive sports programs—not just for its college athletes, but for its high school students as well. The UP Integrated School (UPIS) in UP Diliman, the UP Rural High School (UPRHS) in UP Los Baños, the UP High School Iloilo (UPHSI) in the UP Visayas Iloilo City campus, and UP High School Cebu in UP Cebu are the four UP-administered high schools. Each of them developed and maintains various varsity and sports teams, and these teams go on to compete in regional and national competitions. Each knows the value there is in instilling a love of sports, both for its athletes and the institutions.

Smells like team spirit

The UPIS, the laboratory school of the UP College of Education, has five official varsity teams—basketball, volleyball for boys and girls, swimming, track and field, and table tennis—as well as a Junior Pep Squad. These teams, dubbed the Junior Maroons, compete in the juniors division of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP) and often bring home the gold, especially in swimming. Other as yet unofficial sports teams include taekwondo, fencing, and a swimming team at the elementary school level, whose members compete in the Palarong Pambansa. UPIS varsity alumni, such as swimmer Priscilla Aquino, Diego Dario and the Gomez-De Liano brothers Javi and Juan of the UP Maroons, basketball players Paolo Mendoza, Samuel Marata, Marvin Cruz, and Joel Tolentino, to name just a few, have gone on to compete in wider fields such as the UAAP, the PBA, and national and international competitions.

The UPRHS has six varsity teams—swimming, football, basketball, volleyball, chess and badminton—plus the table tennis team and the UPRHS Filipina Dance Troupe. According to Prof. Perla Bejerano of the UPRHS, all the varsity teams of UPRHS compete in sports competitions, from the district meet to the unit meet to the provincial meet under the Department of Education. The teams also compete against other high schools within Los Baños in friendly games and sports competitions organized by the UPLB and the local government of Los Baños. In fact, for SY 2017-2018, two players from the UPRHS football varsity team, Grade 11 student Angelo del Rosario and Grade 10 student Aaron Ramos, advanced to the One Laguna meet, which comes after the provincial meet.

The UPHSI fields several sports teams to compete in city and integrated meets, in the Western Visayas Regional Schools Athletic Association (WVRAA) meet, and the Palarong Pambansa: chess, basketball, arnis, badminton, lawn tennis, table tennis, taekwondo poomsae, dance sport, volleyball for both boys and girls, soccer for boys and softball for girls. In 2017, two Grade 10 students, Heather Angelique Parangan and Marc Leo Layson, won the championship during the Western Visayas Regional Athletic Association (WVRAA) Meet in the Junior Category of the Latin American Dance Sport Competition under the guidance of their coaches, Prof. Imelda Catequista and Prof. Jessie Labiste, Jr. UPHSI Dance Sport athletes competed again and won in the 2018 Palarong Pambansa DanceSport Competition in Vigan, Ilocos Sur, representing Region 6—Heather Parangan and Carlos Gabriel Sola in Grades C and D Modern Standard, and John Louie Animas and Jasmine Venice Parangan in the Grade E Latin Dance category.

Making Ripples in Mauban – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/making-ripples-in-mauban/,"


Sometimes it doesn’t matter how small the stone is. What’s amazing is how the small ripples it creates become bigger and wider as they move farther away from where the stone was dropped in the water.

That’s exactly what the Teacher Development Program (TDP) of the UP Open University (UPOU) has been doing in Mauban, Quezon since 2005.

What started as a capacity-building program to help public elementary and high school teachers through training programs and scholarship grants has grown to include other sectors integral to the development of the municipality.

Because of its impact, the United Nations Educa­tional, Scientific and Cultural Organization has cited the TDP in a 2017 report as one of the good lifelong learning practices in Southeast Asia.

 

Perfect timing

It seemed like the stars had aligned for the creation of TDP. UPOU Chancellor Melinda Bandalaria, then the University Registrar, was actively seeking funding for scholarship programs for teachers when Quezon Power called for a proposal on a sustainable training program for teachers. Both institutions had what each other needed and with the added sup­port of the local government, the Department of Education-Quezon, and UPOU Foundation Inc., the program was born.

Bandalaria says it was a great opportunity “to test the private sector-government-academe partnership model” and to design a continuing professional development program that combined formal and non-formal courses to upgrade knowledge on subject areas, strengthen teaching skills, and allow the pursuit of advanced degrees.

While things seemed to be in order for TDP’s roll-out, the program faced an enormous challenge outside its purview: its target participants were intimidated by the prospect of studying in UP.

Building confidence

Mauban human resources head Conchita Mirabue­no reveals that during the first phase of TDP, “There was a lot of apprehension because of the implement­ing school. They were so afraid they couldn’t meet the standards and requirements of UP.” This was also noted by Luisa Gelisan in a reflection paper she wrote on the TDP, which she has been a part of since its inception.

This hurdle was overcome through the TDP’s en­couragement, which built the scholars’ confidence and guidance on what a UPOU student’s life entails. As TDP continued, the number of eager applicants increased. They witnessed how it has helped not only in the professional development and promo­tion of their fellow teachers, but also in enhancing their capabilities to become more effective educa­tors. Quezon Power even reports that the perfor­mance of Mauban schools with TDP scholar teach­ers improved in the national aptitude tests because of the program.

Building the confidence of those pioneer scholars has, in turn, empowered those around them to also pursue self-improvement—whether as teachers, administrators, or students.

 

Resources, adaptability, and evolution

As with any program, funding is a consistent concern in implementation. For TDP, there have been highs, like national political support that expanded the program to the whole first district of Quezon, and lows, such as the withdrawal of local political support that left the TDP operating on half its needed budget."

In the UP Diliman infirmary, an annual physical exam means you go for the required tests from one department to another, falling in line for each test. Then you wait hours or days, going back to the same venues, for the results, before being finally ready for a doctor’s assessment of your general state of health.

The process is stressful and drawn out, but you’re more or less assured that all bases are covered. In a rural health facility, the situation is worse. All the equipment it will most likely have will be thermometers, stethoscopes, sphygmomanometers, weighing scales, and for expectant mothers, speculums.

The staff can tell you if you have fever, the state of your heartbeat, your blood pressure, your weight. If you’re expecting, they’ll tell you if the baby’s heartbeat is OK, and if you’re close to giving birth.

But don’t expect to get exact figures about a whole lot of other important things. They can only estimate the level of oxygen in your blood, which helps detect lung and cardiovascular problems. The staff will have difficulty measuring the fetus’s heart rate at critical times of the pregnancy and delivery, and the strength of a mother’s uterine contractions during labor and delivery, which indicates distress of the mother and the baby.

For such exact measurements, you would have to go to a better-equipped polyclinic in town, which is probably half a day’s travel away for most Filipinos.

That’s why the RxBox is a game-changer. It’s a life-saving invention of UP, in a box which combines several diagnostic devices for common medical problems, computerizing results, and electronically transmitting data.

Doctors, health workers, physicists, computer scientists, and electrical and electronics engineers helped put this box together. This handheld machine has a blood pressure monitor, a pulse oximeter, an electrocardiogram (ECG), a fetal heart monitor and a maternal tocometer with fetal movement marker, and a temperature sensor—all built around a touch-screen tablet. Because it’s modular, it can be integrated with more devices in the future."

It was a blatant 103-48 win for the UST Growling Tigresses over the UP Lady Fighting Maroons on September 7, 2019 at Smart Araneta, in their first round match in UAAP Season 82 Women’s Basketball.

The Tigresses controlled each quarter, scoring 26, 22, 28, and 27, over UP’s 17, 13, 8, and 10, the former padding their lead to 55 in the final quarter.

But the Lady Maroons gave a fight.

UP made the first point, courtesy of rookie Ash Taulava. But it was rookie Rei Sanchez who clocked in the longest along with Mika de Leon, scoring 11 and 10 points, and making 11 and 6 boards, respectively. Sanchez made two successful shots from six attempts outside the perimeter, while De Leon was successful in one of two. Jona Lebico chipped in another 10 points, making 100 percent of her four free throws.

Most people hold health and wellness as an ideal, but in order to truly achieve a state of optimal wellness or well-being, one must first be clear about its meaning. Although there is no universally accepted definition of wellness, below are a few definitions:

“Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” (World Health Organization)"

Health and wellness are fundamental concerns in a university setting. There is a need to proactively promote good health and optimum wellness among university constituents—students, faculty, staff, and alumni. Health and wellness programs are important in ensuring the productivity of university employees. They should address health concerns and provide healthy options that could reduce health care costs and increase vitality among university constituents to function productively in the university.

How Do You Make a Carillon Sing? – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/how-do-you-make-a-carillon-sing/,"


There is a structure in the University of the Philippines whose music has survived some of the most tumultuous years of the 20th century. No symbol other than the Oblation captures the timelessness of the UP alumni’s loyalty to both country and alma mater. Moreover, it is the only structure in the University with an unofficial Twitter account that religiously echoes its real time activities online.

Iskos and iskas are likely to have realized at this point that the structure in question is none other than the Andres Bonifacio Central Carillon Tower or, simply, the UP Carillon. The 130-foot tall brainchild of National Artist Juan Nakpil has been the Diliman campus’ official time-keeper and music player since 1952. It served as the eyes of student activists during the First Quarter Storm of the 1970s and witnessed UP’s transformation into the country’s only national university in 2008.

Despite its iconic sound, very few people have any understanding of how the Carillon actually plays its music. While the notes of L’Internationale proudly rang out during Karl Marx’s 200th birth anniversary and a somber rendition of “Bayan Ko” marked the May 2018 ouster of former Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno, the mechanisms and individuals behind the music have remained obscure. Are humans or machines to thank for the gift of music that punctuated these events?

According to Henriette Baes and David Israel of the University Theater Complex, the process involves a little bit of both. Ever since the UP Alumni Association (UPAA) turned over the Carillon to UP Diliman in 2010, the task of operating, recording for, and maintaining the Carillon has been taken over by technical assistants like them. Through their work, human musicality and improvisation are married with computers to compose and time the tunes that we now know so well.

A quick internet search of carillon-playing reveals clips of skilled carillonneurs striking the long, baton-like keys of a clavier with closed fists in order to play the solemn carillon music in old European cities. And, indeed, Baes says that this was initially how UP’s own Carillon was played. Masters like Adrian Antonisse, Jr., Eva Gonzales and Wesley Tubuyoyong once graced the landings of the Carillon to make its bells sing."

November 12, 2018 | Written by Andre DP Encarnacion

What does it mean to be able to live a “decent life”? Is it getting paid a certain salary? Does money even sufficiently capture its meaning?

These are just some of the questions that have continually run through the mind of Jose Antonio “Ton” Clemente recently. Since his PhD training at the University of Macau, Clemente has become a firm believer that psychologists like him could play a role in solving issues like social inequality in the country. And as a freshly minted PhD in 2017, he decided that he would focus his energies on seeing if he could work towards realizing that possibility.

But can Social Psychology, as he believes, really offer something positive to the social justice conversation beyond what tried-and-tested factors like wages and prices provide?

This 2018, with help from his friends, Clemente seems to be zeroing in on his answer. As the only UP-based author in a soon-to-be-released study, he and his colleagues have found that the freedom people have to pursue goals that they value, given a certain income level, can have significant effects on their overall well-being. Experts like Clemente call these beliefs “perceived capabilities,” and they could soon redefine how we understand concepts like ‘fair pay’ in our country in the years to come.

 

A dismal topic

With its ungarnished view of the human factors underlying social inequality, even Clemente admits that the Social Psychology of Social Class was one topic even he hesitated to tackle.

“I was very much a showbiz person,” admits Clemente, who was better known for his work on values and interpersonal relationships. “Early on, I was not very comfortable with topics that were sad or bleak, because these topics make you have to face reality.”

Apprenticing abroad under Prof. Allan Bernardo for his PhD, however, Clemente felt he could hide no longer. Being part of a laboratory that dealt with the psychology of social inequality eventually opened him up to new ideas and new goals. After exposure to critical texts in the field as well as to the plight of Filipino migrants in Macau, Clemente ultimately decided to bring this relevant approach back home. “I just got older, and it was time to face more difficult conversations.”

And it was back home where Clemente got introduced to his current approach and his present co-authors. At the 2017 summer school of the Asian Association for Social Psychology, Clemente joined Ateneo’s Mendiola Teng-Calleja and Ma. Ligaya Menguito to study under the humanitarian work psychologist, Stuart Carr, and find how “capabilities” could be used to understand social phenomena like wages. But what exactly are capabilities?

Clemente describes capabilities as the freedom of individuals to pursue goals that they value. These goals can be tangible or intangible (e.g. a nice house, good social relationships). Thus, pursuing them involves a balance of personal agency and freedom from social constraints.

As psychologists, the trio naturally studied a person’s subjective perception of his/her capabilities and how these might predict performance, depending on monthly income. “We argue that this emphasizes the value of interpretations,” Clemente says. “The government can define the poverty line or the middle class at a certain income level. But as an individual, you still have your own perspective on it—maybe I don’t personally feel that poor or wealthy despite my category. And that’s the subjective element we want to put forward, that the way a person sees these material things is crucial in predicting outcomes.”

 

Magandang Buhay

To determine what Filipinos actually value in life, Clemente and his group utilized dimensions from a study in 2000 by UP psychologist Lynna Marie SyCip and her colleagues that directly asked people that question. Using a combination of focus groups and a nationwide survey, SyCip identified 11 indicators of magandang buhay or “the good life” according to Filipinos. These ranged from physical health to being able to practice one’s religion and spiritual life.

A sizeable group of high school students from across the nation visited the University of the Philippines Los Baños (UPLB) when experts representing both academe and industry pitched the advantages of pursuing a career in Chemistry at the week-long fair, Kapnayan 2019. Kapnayan is a triennial event organized by the UPLB Chemical Society (ChemSoc), that aims to spread awareness about chemistry and its allied sciences through activities based on the year’s theme, and to inspire future scientists to be catalysts for change through the study of Chemistry.

This year’s Kapnayan had the theme, “Sustainable Development Through Advancement in Green Chemistry and Renewable Energy Technology”.  Opening ceremonies were held on January 14, 2019 at UPLB’s NCAS Auditorium. In line with this year’s theme and the global call for more sustainable approaches to national development, the UPLB ChemSoc invited three speakers from government and the private sector to talk about current opportunities in pursuing the areas stated in the theme, as well as their importance to the country’s national development.

First to speak was National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Calabarzon Regional Director Luis Banua. In his message to the students, Banua grounded the importance of studying green chemistry and renewable energy in “Ambisyon Natin 2040”, the long-term economic and social vision of the Philippines, which was signed into existence by President Rodrigo Duterte in 2016. In this vision, Banua said that the government envisions the development of a resilient society and a competitive economy, both of which will be made possible by advancing science and technology and innovation.

Banua mentioned what he thought were the two key strategies to bring this vision about: 1) putting the proper infrastructure–minds, institutions and certifications–in place for green chemistry and sustainable energy to be productive; and, 2) being informed of the need to pursue sustainable energy solutions in a country reliant on cheaper energy sources like coal for development.

In addition to implementing policy mechanisms in laws like the Renewable Energy Act of 2008, Banua said that these plans will hinge on the development of quality scientists and research, which he hoped the secondary school students who attended the fair would consider pursuing. Highlighting these in Kapnayan, he added, “is a way to make known the vast opportunities we have towards researches and studies that are supported by local and international development forecasts.”Moreover, he said that with more than 60% of Luzon’s energy coming from Calabarzon, students in the region can play a major role in securing the country’s future through the pursuit of sustainable energy solutions.

UP alumna Gloryrose Dy-Metilla and her friends are on a mission to give indigenous Mindanao architecture its rightful place in the public eye.

“It’s dying,” said Gloryrose Dy-Metilla. A deep sense of urgency ran through the voice of the professional architect and UP alumna, as if she were referring to a friend about to be taken before his time.

Her subject, however, was no single person but a time-honored way of being and doing. Dy-Metilla observed how traditional Mindanao architecture and design were beginning to disappear, even within tribal communities themselves. That fact was not lost on her co-founders at the Swito Corporation (swito: a Bisaya term that means “wise guy”—a Davao-based social innovation hub where Dy-Metilla joins her sister Glorypearl Dy and fellow alumni Marben Jan Picar and Angely Chi as Chief of Design and Innovation.

It all began when Gloryrose and her colleagues began holding digital storytelling workshops among Midnanao’s different ethnolinguistic groups. The group had been collecting interesting, personal narratives from members of their far-flung villages for a few years when the architect in Gloryrose could not help but ask: “Where are all the traditional houses?”

As it turned out, in spite of the otherwise strong pride of place among residents that they observed, many of the island’s indigenous peoples were slowly moving away from their own traditional architecture. This, as Gloryrose saw it, was part of a much bigger problem—the lack of a general consciousness of even the existence of diverse indigenous designs all over the country.

“We mostly just know about our bahay na bato and our bahay kubo,” said Gloryrose, who only gained a full-fledged appreciation for that diversity herself as an Architecture student in UP Mindanao. “I think the reason why it’s dying is that it was never really promoted anywhere. People never really got to know about it”.

Pooling together their brains and resources in 2013, Gloryrose Dy-Metilla and her colleagues decided to do something to change that.

Empowering communities

That decision led to the establishment of Switodesigns, Inc., a multidisciplinary design studio based in Davao City that seeks to promote traditional architecture, Mindanaoan cultural identity, and participatory practices in design. To its founders, the roots of the company in the act of storytelling is self-evident. What they hope to do is to provide the “tangible structures” that house the lived experiences that the people of Mindanao seek to share.

One major aspect of the work is helping indigenous communities to remember and restore their own communities. The process begins with the team visiting and holding workshops in a specific location. To take a recent example, the Switodesigns team led by Gloryrose and principal architect Henna Dazo gathered community members of the Ata-Manobo tribe in Davao to engage in a process of “remembering” and a joint re-creation in miniature of the tribe’s designs.

This process is essential, Gloryrose said, because many of the peoples they visit have no tribal community to speak of at all due to armed conflict or natural disasters. The process, they say, guides both community members and Switodesigns to construct tribal villages in the communities’ ancestral domains. Through the process of remembering, Dy-Metilla considers both process and product to be of indigenous ownership. “We are just here to facilitate the remembrance of what they had almost forgotten.”

In the case of the Ata, the centerpiece project of the cooperation is the building of their Panuluanan, or “school of living traditions.” The school is where members of the Ata community engage in “cultural remembering”. It is where an indigenous craft expert in disciplines, like weaving or dance, can impart their knowledge to younger generations. The construction of this and other structures in the cultural village are completely IP-led, with labor and building materials provided by community members themselves.

The second aspect of Switodesigns’ mission involves spreading awareness of Mindanao’s traditional architecture through their clients and projects. “We suggest indigenous designs to our local clients, because we don’t just want to help communities without educating the clients themselves,” Gloryrose said. “We want them to appreciate that this is from Mindanao, and that we are promoters and advocates of Mindanao.”

Swito Designs, Inc. is dedicated to bring the virtues of peace, unity and interaction among cultures through their projects and workshops. (Photo by Swito Designs, Inc., http://switodesigns.com)

The greenest ever

Recently, the use of indigenous designs and elements has been catching on among the company’s non-IP clientele—a fact that pleasantly surprises Dy-Metilla herself. “We found that people really want to know about and want to have these kinds of structures.”

“When we talk to people, they ask us: why is it that when we go to Thailand, we get to see Thailand [architecture] immediately? When we go to Cambodia, we see Cambodia. Why can’t we have this in Mindanao?”

One practical reason for the rising popularity of Switodesigns’ structures is the innate suitability of indigenous designs to Philippine climate and geography. “It’s the greenest we can ever have,” Dy-Metilla remarked proudly. The ridged bamboo and rattan roofs of the Maranao torogan, for instance, offers the kind of cool air flow closely associated with “tropical designs” currently in vogue.

Indigenous designs also offer not only comfort but the potential to save lives. The exceptionally long eaves generally found in indigenous roofs and the awning windows protect residents from the ravages of the winds and rains. Moreover, structures like the torogan are very earthquake- and flood-resistant. “We all know they said the Japanese introduced the [earthquake-resistance] concept to us,” she said. “But it was already being used by the Maranaos.”

Gloryrose and her colleagues believe that more than any single element, the innate empathy that pervades and inspires indigenous designs makes them a true source of Philippine pride on the world stage. “Empathy for self, empathy for nature, and empathy for the people around you. If you can make a framework for what Mindanao architecture is, it includes all of these.”

3D puzzles

Even with a string of recent successes, Gloryrose and her friends from Switocorp are not resting on their laurels. Just last year, the group launched Balay Balay 3D Architecture, their newest initiative to promote Mindanao design. Inspired by Dy-Metilla’s passion to spread the appreciation of Mindanao’s indigenous structures among adults, the group is hoping to do the same with children by crafting 3D puzzles modeled after native houses and other traditional spaces.

“What can represent our country as a structure?” asked Marben Jan Picar, one of Switocorp’s co-founders. Shaken by the fact that they could find no other structure besides the nipa hut that most fit the bill for most people, the group launched the project with the aim to make Mindanao architecture as ingrained in the consciousness of Filipino children as Legos and yoyos.

Each of Balay Balay’s puzzles goes through a long process of validation before being made. Consultations are done with indigenous peoples, academics, and NGOs before the month-long process of carving and painting begins.

Their work has caught the eye not only of children and their families who view their works, but also of indigenous peoples who are struck with nostalgia when they see the pieces. Gloryrose recalls a number of Maranao visitors from Lanao who saw their torogan model and said that they would work to rehabilitate their own, which had become dilapidated over the years.

“People who visit our exhibits would say, ‘That’s where we used to play, in-between the torogan posts. And that was like 20 or so years ago’.”

Whether it involves reigniting the spark of nationalism in their fellow Mindanaoans or helping young Filipinos gain insight into their rich and complex heritage, Gloryrose Dy-Metilla hopes that their efforts open the door for more people to appreciate Mindanao and the rest of the country better. “I think for us Filipinos,” she explained, “we are instilled early on with the idea that everything foreign is good. We yearn for that green card, for our family members to finally get to the US, and things like that.

They just don’t know enough about our culture. And if there aren’t enough people who will show them, how will they find out?”"

For 34 years, it was a highly anticipated UP event, promoted and covered by national newspapers and magazines. It was the Cadena de Amor festival, a grand parade that met the sunset with its three festival queens and university seniors in their white gowns who carried and passed on a vine of cadena de amor—the floral signature of Diliman—to juniors in pink.

According to historical notes at the UP Diliman (UPD) Archives, it was a rite of passage in which women seniors handed over the “responsibility of upholding the virtues, ideals, and traditions of the University” to their younger counterparts.

 

A clipping from the Philippines Free Press in 1954

 

Ideals and ideas

It began in 1934, when UP President Jorge Bocobo had just taken over the university leadership. Dean of Women Ursula Clemente initiated the event “upon instructions” from him.

An unattributed 1955 article in the archives titled “Cadena De Amor: Pink and White” reports that Bocobo “broached to Mrs. Clemente the idea of a ritual befitting the classic architectural background of the old UP buildings in Padre Faura.” Clemente and Prof. Melquiades Gamboa then came up with Cadena de Amor, and the UP Woman’s Club (UPWC) took charge of the festival.

According to The University Experience, the festival was inspired by the annual Daisy Chain of Vassar College, New York, USA, in which a group of sophomore women chosen by a committee of seniors “carry a 150-foot chain of daisies and laurel” during commencement day. They wore white dresses and served “as a flower-lined corridor to guide the graduates to the ceremony.” Vassar history says daisies traditionally decorated the college’s old chapel for Class Day, the day before graduation where seniors meet as Vassar students for the last time.

In the 1958 Cadena de Amor souvenir program, Clemente’s message states that “The three principal characters of the Festival as well as the Chain of the Cadena de Amor are symbolic of what the University of the Philippines stands for in respect to the Filipino woman.” The chain of pink flowers stands for the “continuous flow of ideas and ideals of [UP] through the students, all designed for the service of country, mankind, and God.”

“The first festival was held with the stately columns of the old Padre Faura halls for background. On the old campus the Seniors in white left the university compound at Isaac Peral, breaking into two lines. One line went down Taft Avenue, and the other passed through Nebraska Street. The lines would finally meet at the University Quadrangle… [and] the Juniors would then join them from Padre Faura,” wrote the noted fictionist and essayist SV Epistola, then a graduating student, in the Philippine Collegian in 1953.

Tradition and evolution

Though incomplete, the Cadena de Amor files at the UPD Archives still manage to tell the story of this once-celebrated UP event and its development through the years.

In 1936, the Philippine Collegian reported that “for the first time in the history of the University of the Philippines,” the Cadena de Amor would be held as part of commencement week. Since then, the festival was held as an event that closed the academic year.

When UP transferred from its Manila campus to Diliman in 1949, the first Cadena de Amor in the new campus was held at the Sunken Garden, according to the UPD Catalogue. Later on, it was held around the Quezon Hall complex—the Amphitheater and the quadrangle or Oblation Plaza.

Based on available copies of the souvenir programs, earlier ceremonies had six parts in the main program: “The Tendrils,” the concert of the UP ROTC Band; “The Verdant Leaves,” the processional; “The Petals,” where “UP Beloved” was sung, the meaning of the festival was narrated, Annie Ramos’ poem “Cadena de Amor” was recited, “The Song of Maria Clara” was sung, a message to the elder sisters was delivered, and the elder sisters then responded; “The Loops and Links,” the passing of the cadena de amor chain; “The Vine,” the closing remarks by the UP Woman’s Club president and singing of the club hymn; and “The Clusters,” the recessional. The festival also had a “Rigodon de Honor” and a ball.

Over the years, festival elements changed. “Auld Lang Syne” was specified as the song during the passing of the chain. “The Tendrils” was no longer used. “UP Beloved” and “The Song of Maria Clara” disappeared. Festival muses had bigger roles in the ceremony. “Rigodon de Honor” became “Grand March,” then was no longer in the program. Ramos’ poem was replaced with “Cadena de Amor Festival” by Trinidad Tarrosa (later, Tarrosa-Subido). The “Ball” became the “Graduation Ball,” later the “Pink and White Ball” was no longer mentioned in the souvenir program.

 

 

The Cadena de Amor featured three festival queens: Filipinas, Alma Mater, and Maria Clara (later, Lakambini). They were academic achievers, members of various student organizations, recipients of scholarships, and participants in social and civic activities.

Clemente described them in 1958 as follows: Filipinas symbolizes the “noble role that the Filipino woman plays in national and international affairs;” Alma Mater, “learning and wisdom, for the continuous quest for truth, beauty, and goodness;” and Maria Clara, “the continued preservation of the pristine moral values of Filipino womanhood.”

Filipinas and Alma Mater were seniors or members of the graduating class while Maria Clara or Lakambini came from a lower batch. A list of festival queens in the archived files show that the last Maria Clara title was given in 1960 and the title changed to Lakambini the following year."

The University of the Philippines, the country’s national university, is known globally as a university system that fosters the ideals of academic excellence, freedom and human rights, nationalism and development, and progressive thinking, hence its campuses, especially the UP Diliman and Manila campuses, are also famous for being centers of student activism and dissent.

The culture of activism in UP that we recognize today has largely been shaped by the student and people’s movements that challenged the prevailing social order and culminated in historical events from the 1960s to the present. Younger generations of scholars have taken the helm and are carrying on with the “fight for a better world,” bringing with them the valuable lessons of the past and learning from existing social realities and the people’s ongoing struggles.

 

 

How it began

The earliest protests in UP happened between 1915-1920, when students petitioned university officials and held demonstrations during the term of UP’s first Filipino President Ignacio Villamor. They involved the wrongful arrest of an instructor during the celebration of the first University Day, extended scholarships, and most loudly then, the “unwarranted press attack” on Villamor. From the UP campus along Padre Faura, students and faculty marched toward the Manila Times office in Sta. Cruz, Manila to condemn the newspaper’s editorial and to defend UP’s Villamor. The issue of tuition hikes first surfaced during the term of President Rafael Palma (1923-1933).

The first UP administrations up to the 1970s are credited for institutionalizing academic freedom and excellence, student leadership, service, and patriotism, core principles of present-day activism. Palma “encouraged discussions on social and political issues confronting the country.” Jorge Bocobo “promoted patriotism and love of culture in the university. He also promoted values such as discipline, duty and sacrifice, values which he believed were essential for nation-building.”

A bastion of nationalism

Social contradictions transformed UP “into a bastion of intense nationalism” in the 1950s to 1970s.

According to Jose Maria Sison (AB English, 1959), “student activists originating from the UP stirred up the masses of youth and working people to conduct concerted protest actions, shaking the entire country in the entire 1960s, from the demonstration of 5,000 UP student demonstrators… to the First Quarter Storm of 1970 which rocked the national capital region with almost weekly marches and rallies of 50,000 to 100,000 people against the Marcos regime.” Sison should know; he founded a new Communist Party in 1968.

Crises and the radicalization of youth in the 1960s to 1970s gave birth to organizations such as the Kabataang Makabayan. Rising prices of basic commodities, worsening poverty of peasants and exploitation of workers, and corruption and abuses reported during those years fueled militancy and social upheavals.

The most dramatic examples of student militancy engaged in by UP students during this period were the massive protests of the First Quarter Storm, including the barricading of the UP Diliman campus against police assaults during the Diliman Commune of February 1971.

From radical organizations came the thousands of youth who would become progressive leaders of aboveground organizations, on one hand, and revolutionaries of underground organizations on the other, both aiming to defeat fascism and, soon after, with President Ferdinand Marcos’ declaration of martial law in September 1972, the overthrow of the dictatorship.

According to Dr. Carol Pagaduan-Araullo, former vice chairperson of the UP Student Council, “Activists took very seriously the revolutionary imperative of bringing about the downfall of the oppressive status quo… student activists were at the forefront of breaking the “tyranny of silence” by scribbling defiant slogans on blackboards and walls, smuggling manifestoes, holding secret discussions and conducting lightning rallies.”

During martial law, “subversive” organizations were banned, along with the student councils, publications, and organizations that were closed down or tightly watched by the State. Despite the repression, students persevered in fighting for what they believed in, linking up with workers and farmers for social change.

The opening of the art exhibit, “August Rush: The Stunning Life in Agriculture,” on August 13 at the DL Umali Hall, University of the Philippines Los Baños (UPLB) in Laguna signaled the start of the centennial celebration of the Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics (DAAE) of the UPLB College of Economics and Management (CEM). The exhibit, cosponsored by the UPLB Office for Initiatives in Culture and the Arts (OICA), featured diverse artworks portraying farm life and provided the audience “a glimpse of how spectacular the agriculture sector is.”

“We’ve been feeding the minds of agricultural economists for over a hundred years. Now, we want to feed not only the minds but also the heart and soul; that’s why we are starting our centennial celebration with this art exhibit,” said Dr. Antonio Jesus Quilloy, chair of DAAE.

“August Rush” showcased exemplary artworks by Quilloy and fellow artists, Jowee Aguinaldo, Karla Sajona-Sta. Cruz, Aaron Sta. Cruz, Bing Famoso Tac-an, Glenn Blanco, Gem Blanco, Deo Blanco, and Sarah Cuenco, depicting life in agriculture through various mediums, styles, and techniques.

“Despite the downward trajectory of its economic performance in the Philippines and the Asian Region, the sector maintains its economic and social significance—being the main livelihood in the countryside; a major supplier of food and raw materials in both rural and urban societies; and an important ally in natural resource conservation,” Prof. Jaymee Cabangbang said at the opening ceremony. “The sector, despite the changing times, remains a wellspring of inspiration for Filipino artists,” she added."

Estudillo first praised her batchmates. “Hindi mo hinayaang diktahan ka ng iyong kalagayan. Bagkus, nagawa mong lampasan ang hamon na ipinukol sa ‘yo. [You did not allow circumstances to dictate upon you. Instead, you were able to surmount the challenge thrown at you.]”

“Kaya ka narito, [That’s why you’re here]” she said.

She paid homage to “lakas at diskarte ng babae,” having been raised by what she described as a “nagsasariling ina.” Growing up asthmatic, she learned to value each day. “There’s something miraculous each day if you’re willing to see.”

Estudillo thanked UP for having taught students to measure success in terms of helping others, and God for unconditional and boundless love. “Ang paglilingkod sa Kaniya ay paglilingkod sa bayan [Serving God is serving others],” she stressed.

“Kaisa tayo sa mithiing-bayan, magkakaiba man ang pamamaraan [We are one in serving the country, although in different ways],”  she said. “Some of us here may be silent, but we are not blind. . . . There’s an Oble in each of us,” Estudillo added before engaging the class to individually declare themselves as the beginning of change starting that day.

Digal then spoke of his dream of UP Mindanao contributing to the development of Mindanao, “with the University bringing the best of the world to Mindanao and the best of Mindanao to the rest of the world.”

Candidates for graduation from the Iloilo City and Miagao town campuses of UP Visayas had a  glimpse of their possible future in the person of fishing industry leader, Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr., who spoke before them during the constituent university’s 40th commencement exercises on June 27, 2019 in the UP Visayas Miagao campus.

Laurel is the president of Frabelle Fishing Corporation, a 100-percent Filipino-owned company which, according to him, has emerged as one of the top three fishing companies in the world from the last 20 years, and which has grown to a fleet of 150 fishing vessels from just two old ones purchased with borrowed money in the sixties.

UP Visayas is a center of fisheries and marine sciences education, research, and extension in the country. Laurel presented his corporation as an example of how these disciplines combined with knowledge in management and technology, which all happen to be pursued and delivered in the four colleges and one school of UP Visayas, could make an international success story out of a Philippine corporation that started humbly enough.

“I hope to make you realize that there is a future in fisheries and mariculture industry,” Laurel stressed.

“[With] the colleges [and school] that compose UP Visayas, [and] the seafood industry, I believe we can do much more if we all work together as one,” Laurel said, speaking before around 825 candidates for graduation from the Iloilo Province campuses of UP Visayas.

“Our country’s fisheries is a resilient, renewable resource but which is currently in an alarming situation, but if managed properly and sustainably, with a strong political will, can benefit many Filipinos for many generations to come,” he added.

Tahanan. Home. That was the theme of the UP Diliman (UPD) Commencement Exercises held on June 30 at the University Amphitheater.

Home is where you feel love and care, where you rest and get nourishment, where you are listened to, and where you dream and create. In times of turmoil, home is a place of refuge and renewal. This was how National Artist for Theater and University Professor Emeritus Amelia Lapeña-Bonifacio described it in her commencement address. And she considered UP her “second home.” Her affinity with the University began when she entered as an English major in 1948.

Lapeña-Bonifacio gave the UPD Class of 2019 three pieces of advice: ambition is important but it needs to be balanced by reality; failing is not the end of the world; it just means there was something lacking in what we did so we should persist until we succeed; and, serve with honor and excellence without asking for anything in return.

As with the commencement speaker, BA Philosophy summa cum laude graduate Joshua Emmanuel Ramos, who spoke on behalf of the graduating class, said that the capacity to love is rooted in the home. In UP, this capacity is strengthened when academic life is coupled with empathy and unity with the masses. As an example, he cited the many UP graduates who have turned their backs on lucrative careers to serve as teachers of Lumad children.

Ramos, who graduated with a weighted average grade of 1.096, added that home is where inquiring minds are first developed; and, in the University, the inquiring mind is further encouraged and nurtured. When he is asked why people from UP always question the government that funds their education as though they are attacking their own parents, Ramos said he remembers how his father was at home. “He never told me to not answer. What he would always say is to not answer rudely. Which means as long as there is respect, there is nothing wrong with answering, reasoning out, or asking.”

At the end of his speech, Ramos told his fellow graduates, “Just as UP became our home and refuge, may we also be the refuge for those who long for freedom from their oppressive realities.”

In his message, Te urged the graduates to stand up for truth, justice, and human rights amidst “a war that is being waged on many fronts and in many forms.” He explained that every Iskolar ng Bayan must “remember always who we are” as scholars who “come from the people” and who are expected to “always put the people first.”

“Be good people. . . as Iskolar ng Bayan, Iskolar para sa Bayan,” Te advised. He also gave several examples on how UP graduates can help others, as innovators and leaders. “Find ways to help. . . . Be a counterculture,” added Te.

Everybody loves Pep Squad ng Bayan. Year after year, the performance of the University of the Philippines Varsity Pep Squad (UP Pep Squad) easily becomes the highlight of the Cheerdance Competition (CDC) by the eight-school University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP), whether it’s because of the team’s consistent podium finish for twenty straight years, or its standout theme and unique costumes.

According to UP Pep Squad Head Coach and Assistant Professor Lalaine Pereña of the UP College of Human Kinetics, she usually comes up with the Squad theme after brainstorming with the coaching staff and creative head Juan Carlos Soriano. The initial idea comes from Pereña and is developed by the creative head who then presents the same to the rest of the coaching staff. The inspiration for it varies, sometimes “with just the snap of a finger” and sometimes months after the most recent competition.

The 2015 routine of “Utak Puso” holds a special place in Pereña’s heart. “The whole concept was put together using all our hearts and minds. It was dedicated to all UP athletes who train with all their might for UP Nating Mahal,” the head coach recalled.

The UP Pep Squad was founded in 1994. It was preceded by an all-male UP Cheering Squad and the UP Rah-Rah Girls. Here is a quick stroll down memory lane with the most recent performances of the UP Pep Squad.

In 2007, UP dethroned the reigning champion, the UST Salinggawi Dance Troupe, with a “rock” theme that then team captain Andrea Gonzales described as unique and gloomy, but in a fun, exciting way as accentuated by the team’s matching maroon and black leather outfits. The next year, the Squad donned tribal costumes for the tribo theme, while 2009’s theme featured the life of an Iskolar ng Bayan with familiar images such as bluebooks and the Ikot jeep.

2010 saw the UP Pep Squad as cheerdance champions again, with its fiesta-inspired theme complete with sunflowers, banderitas, and upbeat Filipino music such as “Kapayapaan” by Tropical Depression.

A well-loved cartoonist

A native of Daraga, Albay, the well-loved cartoonist, publisher, and UP Fine Arts professor was known for his comics Siopawman, A Slice of Life, Mang Ambo, and Kalabog en Bosyo. His first work appeared in the weekly magazine Liwayway and his unique Taglish style of communicating eventually found its way to commercial campaign advertisements for products ranging from milk to gasoline to t-shirts and even cans of beer. His skill in the art of illustration and cartooning paved the way for the creation of the UP College of Fine Arts’ Visual Communication Department, which he chaired in the late 1970s. He saw that cartoons played a pivotal role in education and values formation.

His 50-year career generated over “500 characters, 20 comic strips, six movies, two murals, and over 15,000 published pages,” according to his official website. His art illustrated the “snippets of the Filipino way of life” and “captured the idiosyncrasies of the Filipino psyche” which he preserved through humor for generations to come. He served as art director, editorial cartoonist, illustrator, and consultant for various publications, TV shows, and movies. He also headed art associations and received awards from UP Alumni Association, the Mayor of the City of Manila, mass media organizations, and government agencies. He died in 2002.

 

A Pinoy pop icon

After finishing his degree in Music, this icon of Pinoy pop better known as “Mr. C” taught music composition and music theory for almost twenty years at the UP College of Music. He went on to direct the San Miguel Foundation for the Performing Arts after being the only Asian to win in the Onassis International Cultural Competition in Greece in 2001.

His body of work includes modern and popular music spanning theater musicals, choral pieces, commercial recordings, film and television musical scores, short symphonic works, and full-length ballets. His most popular hits include Kay Ganda ng Ating Musika, Nais Ko, Mamang Kutsero, Iduyan Mo, Paraisong Parisukat, and Da Coconut Nut.

Ryan’s legacy started with founding the Ryan Cayabyab Singers, a group of seven singers in the 1990s. This continued with the establishment of the Philpop Music Fest Foundation, Inc. which hosts and the famous music festival recognizing amateur musical talent and songwriting. Ryan Cayabyab has garnered countless awards from the Cultural Center of the Philippines, Awit Awards, UP Alumni Association, and the Ten Outstanding Young Men of the Philippines. He runs the Music School of Ryan Cayabyab with his wife Emmy.

A Statement by the President on Recent Issues Involving Fraternities – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/a-statement-by-the-president-on-recent-issues-involving-fraternities/,"


Recent incidents within the University of the Philippines have drawn renewed attention to the roles and actuations of fraternities on our campuses—in particular, a brawl involving members of two fraternities, and even more disturbingly, a series of offensive posts on social media attributed to the Upsilon Sigma Phi.

 

Let me speak first as the President of this University.

 

Whatever the source of these reported posts may be, the language and the behavior they contain are reprehensible and totally unacceptable in our community. Such flagrant misogyny has no place in a university dedicated to the highest ideals and the practice of gender equality and human rights. That practice is best tested in our private utterances and actions, and the attitudes displayed in these published posts demonstrate how much more we need to do to reform medieval mindsets within the university at all levels.

 

Let me now speak as an Upsilonian.

 

It personally pains me for my fraternity, which is celebrating its Centennial, to have been associated with these posts. They do not represent what we have stood for all these years, as they bring us back to the darkness rather than the light.

 

But my pain cannot be compared to that of those maligned by the posts, and I assure the University community that I will do all I can, both as President and as a fellow of the fraternity, to root out this problem and to instill or reaffirm a culture of respect, tolerance, and decency within Upsilon and our entire fraternity system.

 

Let me be absolutely clear about this: I will not protect any fraternity brother who may be found culpable of these kinds of offensive acts. I call on my fellow Upsilon alumni to support me in this position, so we can bring the fraternity forward into a new and more progressive century."

The result of the National Historical Commission of the Philippines’ (NHCP) P44-million two-year restoration of the UP Visayas (UPV) Main Building in its Iloilo City campus was finally unveiled on August 16.

The undertaking was prompted by UPV’s proposal for rehabilitation and adaptive reuse of the structure that was named a National Historical Landmark by the NHCP in 2009. The restoration was not limited to the design and the materials used. It also ensured the structural integrity of the building.

 

A central feature of the Main Building is this hall that directly faces the main entrance. It was originally the courtroom when the building was still the Iloilo Municipal Building during construction, then later became the Iloilo City Hall upon inauguration. The left photo, taken on 14 August 2017, shows the space as an art gallery with a mezzanine. The right photo, taken on 15 August 2019, shows the hall as it was originally designed. Old wood that matched the original flooring were bought from old houses, according to NHCP Chairman Rene Escalante. (Photos by Misael Bacani, UP MPRO)

The cocosilk road to beauty – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/the-cocosilk-road-to-beauty/,"The cocosilk road to beauty
July 28, 2017 | Written by Celeste Ann Castillo Llaneta



Who doesn’t dream of having clear, beautiful, young-looking skin? And who better to crack the beauty code than the country’s premier national research and development institution?

At the UP Los Baños National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (UPLB-BIOTECH), where traditional and modern biotechnologies combine to make innovative products and processes, the secret to beauty comes down to three letters: VCO or 100% pure virgin coconut oil.

Beauty in oil

Virgin coconut oil, which is one of UPLB-BIOTECH’s top products, is the key ingredient in Cocosilk, a line of handmade, specialty herbal soaps and body scrubs developed at the UPLB-BIOTECH’s Enzyme Research Laboratory by Fides Z. Tambalo, a University researcher and project leader. In an article for the Philippine Star, Tambalo described the Cocosilk line as “made from 100% premium virgin coconut oil certified free from heat and chemical treatments.”

“We were doing the extraction of virgin coconut oil, and we were thinking of what other high value product we could make from the VCO that we made,” Tambalo said in an interview. “Through our studies, we got an idea—why don’t we do a 100% VCO soap?”

Many VCO-based beauty soaps and scrubs are currently hot on the market because of virgin coconut oil’s properties. According to the website Organic Facts, coconut oil is predominantly composed of saturated fatty acids. Among its chief chemical constituents are vitamin E, an anti-oxidant that promotes silky-soft hair and healthy, glowing, younger looking skin. It is well known to have medicinal properties and antimicrobial and antifungal agents, as well as antioxidant and anti-aging properties. It also has moisture-retaining capacity, which makes it ideal to use for dry, cracking skin.

The problem however with some of these commercial soaps is that they may not contain as much pure virgin coconut oil as they claim on their labels. Moreover, the extraction and processing methods used may reduce the moisturizing ability of those soaps. “If you use some of these commercial soaps, you’ll notice that they leave your skin dry, because sometimes the glycerin is taken out, which is then converted into moisturizer or shampoo or conditioner,” said Fides.

The UPLB-BIOTECH, however, uses traditional methods of extraction and processing. This leaves the beauty-enhancing qualities of their VCO completely intact, and are even further enriched with vitamins A, C and E and additives. But the superior quality of the VCO used in the Cocosilk soaps and scrubs is not their only draw.

Heaven’s salad bar

There are at present 20 Cocosilk soap variants, each one containing a unique herb or ingredient—acapulco, carrot, guava, tomato, malunggay, citrus, tamarind, gotu-kola, oatmeal, coffee, chocolate, albumin, fresh milk, jasmine, lavender, malic, rose, mango and citronella. There are also variants of body scrubs designed to exfoliate, whiten and nourish the skin, including cinnamon, lemon, sunflower, strawberry, and cucumber-melon.

https://biotech.uplb.edu.ph/en/products/specialty-soaps-body-scrubs-aromatherapy-oils-and-malunggay-tea-leaves

It is no accident that the variants sound like heaven’s salad bar. “We looked at what’s trending now all over the world, and it’s bringing your food into your personal care,” said Tambalo. “Whatever it is we eat, for instance tomatoes—that will be the active ingredient in our personal care.”

Aside from the properties of VCO, each herb or ingredient adds special properties to the soaps and scrubs. Acapulco leaves, for instance, contain the antifungal chrysophanic acid, and so the Cocosilk soap variant with acapulco is excellent for fungal skin infections and insect bites. The Cocosilk guava variant contains guava leaf extract, which is known for its antiseptic and astringent properties, and is ideal as intimate wash. Aside from being a top source of vitamins A and C, tomatoes are rich in lycopene, an antioxidant ten times more effective than Vitamin E.

Daily use of the malunggay soap, also rich in Vitamins A and C, will promote younger, whiter skin. Soap with citrus rinds and calamansi extract is effective for bleaching freckles and for treating acne. Coffee soap, now popular among beauty lines, is an effective exfoliant and deodorizer. And albumin, or egg white, contains proteins that smoothen and tighten skin, making wrinkles and lines less visible. (More information on each variant is available on the UPLB-BIOTECH’s website, https://biotech.uplb.edu.ph/en/products/specialty-soaps-body-scrubs-aromatherapy-oils-and-malunggay-tea-leaves)."

“Old age is not for sissies.”

This quote, attributed to American actress Bette Davis, seems particularly apt in our society. In a country with a population where people 65 and older make up only 4 percent, our elderly face issues that are not for the faint of heart, such as poverty, abuse and neglect, sickness and disability, and loneliness and alienation from society.

Add to that existential and metaphysical concerns that come with old age—questions about death, the meaning of life, and the vast unknown beyond it. It’s enough to make any youngster glance up from their smartphones in bewilderment, or if they happen to be old enough to have experienced a life crisis, to reach for a shot of gin. But for the elderly, there is no escaping these questions.

“The aging years are as important as that of infancy or of childhood years,” writes UP Baguio assistant professor of psychology Prof. Maria Ana B. Diaz in her paper, “Expressing Religiosity in Old Age,” which she presented at the Growing Up, Growing Old: Times and Seasons 2nd Global Conference held in Prague, Czech Republic, in May 2016.

“Unlike children who look forward to being adolescents, who in turn project how their life will be as adults, and with the latter anticipating how life will be in old age, the elderly have no clear prediction of what it will be after old age or after life.” Being confronted with the prospect of dying is often at best uncomfortable and at worst frightening. “The loss of loved ones, failing health, and narrowing of the social network all lead to feelings of uncertainty,” Diaz continues.

However, when facing the ultimate unknown, the elderly have a source of solace to turn to: religion and spirituality. Diaz notes in her paper that studies have shown a strong link between faith, spirituality and health in the elderly, and that the anxiety experienced by the elderly dissipates when they have faith in a spiritual being to hold on to and to give them a sense of contentment and positive well-being. In fact, according to Diaz, it has been found that “spirituality and religious participation are highly correlated with positive successful aging, as much as diet, exercise, mental stimulation, self-efficacy, and social connectedness.”

For her paper, she focused on the experiences of several elderly members of the indigenous people from the Mountain Province, ages 60 to 73, with regard to religion and spirituality and how these help them cope with the difficult questions of aging. They made for unique subjects because they had two religions/spiritual traditions to call upon, having been both baptized into Christianity (Roman Catholic or Anglican) but also still adhering to their own traditional beliefs as indigenous people.

Diaz also distinguished between spirituality, or the search for significance and for a personal relationship between an individual and God or a supernatural being, and religiosity, which is adherence to certain doctrines and prescribed patterns of behavior. By and large, the elderly indigenous people (IPs) drew comfort from observing the religious practices of Christianity, resulting in “magaan ang loob” (i.e. a feeling of peace and lightness). These practices included attending Sunday services in a church or structure; providing assistance and prayer services to others; and, prayer.

Prayer also helps ease the “death anxiety” that comes with the experience of major life losses as one grows older, such as illness and the loss of a spouse or friends. “Older adults who have strong religious faith are more likely to feel good about themselves, to find more meaning in their life, and to cope with life’s adversities better,” writes Diaz.

The student in the boardroom – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/the-student-in-the-boardroom/,"


On her first Board of Regents (BOR) meeting, Student Regent Ma. Shari Niña G. Oliquino admitted her overwhelming anxiety. UP President Danilo Concepcion turned to her and asked her for a few words. Commission on Higher Education Chairperson Patricia Licuanan then prompted her to discuss a student issue. Shari took the chance to inquire about the tuition collection policy of the University. This helped her realize that while she now had the task to put student issues on the table, it was not an impossible task after all.

In the past, according to Shari, only a student observer was allowed inside meetings of the Board of Regents, the highest policy-making body of the University. The student observer could raise student concerns during discussions but he or she had no voting power. Eventually, the Katipunan ng mga Sangguniang Mag-aaral sa UP campaigned for genuine student representation with voting power in the BOR, to participate more directly in crafting policies affecting students. Today, the Student Regent represents the biggest constituency in the entire UP system. (The BOR also includes a Faculty and a Staff Regent.)

Oliquino believes that the Office of the Student Regent is crucial in light of the signing of Republic Act 10931 or the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act, which grants free tuition and other subsidies to qualified undergraduate students in state universities and colleges. She sees obstacles remaining for students of law and medicine, as well as those struggling academically. She asserts that education is a right to be enjoyed by all regardless of socioeconomic status, and hopes for the support of all UP students from Baguio to Mindanao, knowing she can’t possibly succeed in her advocacy alone.

Accepting the challenge

Asked what made her decide to accept her nomination as Student Regent from UP Mindanao, her response was short: “I didn’t even think twice about it.” Graduating with honors with a degree in Broadcast Communication from the College of Mass Communication in Diliman, she could have taken a break from being a student leader from her grade school days in the UP Integrated School (UPIS).

But in the midst of an intensifying campaign for free education, she couldn’t refuse the call. “I wasn’t going to do it for myself, and serving my fellow students had become my passion, so why not?” she added."
Teaching in mother tongues – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/teaching-in-mother-tongues/,"Teaching in mother tongues
February 6, 2018 | Written by Celeste Ann Castillo Llaneta


Mural at the UP Baguio College of Arts and Communication

 

In 2009, the Department of Education (DepEd) recognized the benefits of teaching children using their mother tongue or first language. Local and international research has found that children learn to speak, read, and write more quickly in their first language, and can pick up a second and third language more easily if taught in their first language. In the same way, they acquire other academic competencies more quickly, particularly in science and math.

Through Department Order 94, DepEd instituted Mother Tongue-Based Multilingual Education (MTB-MLE), with the following major languages as languages of instruction in 2012-2013: Tagalog, Kapampangan, Pangasinense, Iloko, Bikol, Cebuano, Hiligaynon, Waray, Tausug, Maguindanaoan, Maranao, Chabacano, Ivatan, Sambal, Akianon, Kinaray-a, Yakan, and Sinurigaonon. Aside from their mother tongues or first languages, the children are taught English and Filipino as subjects focusing on oral fluency, starting in the first grade. From the fourth grade onward, Filipino and English are introduced as languages of instruction.

A dizzying variety

However, given the dizzying variety of languages in the country—over 170 languages spoken by various ethno-linguistic groups, with almost 50 of these spoken by various groups in northern Philippines alone—it’s not unusual for a teacher to find herself handling a first-grade class in a public school consisting of children from different linguistic backgrounds. This poses a challenge for the teachers: how do they make sure the students learn when they are not all equally competent in the language of instruction?

In her 2016 paper, “A Multilingual, Multicultural and Multidisciplinary Approach to MTBMLE: A Model for Northern Philippines”, Dr. Elizabeth Calinawagan, a professor of Filipino and Dean of the College of Arts and Communication, UP Baguio, gives three possible classroom scenarios a teacher may face.

 

Dr. Elizabeth A. Calinawagan, professor of Filipino and Dean of the College of Arts and Communication, UP Baguio

 

In the first scenario, a school may have a strong community language as its mother tongue and the majority of its students communicating in this language. According to Calinawagan, this scenario is more common in rural areas. In her paper, she recommends that the teacher use a monolingual teaching-learning process, “Basic education [here] should be in the mother tongue. Then you’ll just be transferring knowledge through a lingua franca, and then English.”

In the second scenario, there are more students whose mother tongue is the regional lingua franca—for instance, Ilokano in northern Luzon—and the other students use their own community/indigenous languages as their mother tongue. This scenario is more common in densely populated cities such as Baguio City.

“In one classroom in a public elementary school, the students could have different mother tongues—Maranao, Kankanay, Pangasinan, Ilokano. This could be problematic. The DepEd chose Iloko [as the language of instruction], but teachers encounter difficulties because not all the students speak Iloko. Some are more fluent in Filipino, especially in urban centers.”

A bridge to learning

Calinawagan recommends that, in this case, the teacher use the regional lingua franca as the medium of instruction, but allot a special time to the speakers of other languages, using the regional lingua franca as a bridge to learning in other languages. The teacher would have to consult with the students and their parents to find out what language the child speaks at home, and to seek the cooperation of the parents in translating lessons into and creating learning materials in the child’s mother tongue.

In the third scenario, there could be a strong regional lingua franca, but the students’ linguistic profiles show that they are more competent in languages of wider communication such as English and Filipino. This is more common in private schools, where students are sometimes pressured by the school administration, teachers, and parents to use these languages. Calinawagan recalled a study conducted in San Carlos, Pangasinan, in which parents were asked why they spoke to their children in Tagalog at home instead of their mother tongue.

“They said it was so the children would find it easier to integrate at school, so they are taught bilingually, English and Tagalog, at home.”"
"Scientists explain SARS-CoV-2 mutations, genomics in latest webinar – University of the Philippines",https://up.edu.ph/scientists-explain-sars-cov-2-mutations-genomics-in-latest-webinar/,"

Screenshot from the webinar “Genetic Sequencing Research: Mutation of SARS-Cov-2 (Implications for Clinical Management and Vaccine Development)” aired on July 17, with replay available on the TVUP YouTube channel.

 

Reports on mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, mainly on D614G which affects the spike protein on the virus’ surface, have led the public to ask whether these changes make the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease more infectious, lethal, or on the other hand, benign and less transmissible.

As the official count went beyond 61,000 (as of July 16) confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines, more participants are joining the community of health educators, learners and practitioners following the UP Webinar Series “STOP COVID DEATHS: Clinical Management Updates”.

Dr. Cynthia P. Saloma, Executive Director of the UP Philippine Genome Center and Professor of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology at UP Diliman, talked about “Genetic Sequencing Research: Mutation of SARS-Cov-2 (Implications for Clinical Management and Vaccine Development)” during the 13th episode of the webinar series held on July 17. This episode is now accessible on the YouTube channel of TVUP. This webinar had 1,500 registered participants, the highest number for the series.

Available information shows that globally, there are multiple mutations, and not just three, the resource speaker explained in the webinar. According to Dr. Saloma, even the Philippine isolates have genetic sequences that are unique. “Our analysis shows that they are benign. At this point in time, the data suggest that they are harmless mutations. The information is important for us to track the source of infection and transmissibility,” she explained.  She added that more research needs to be done to help scientists and policymakers understand how these mutations affect existing health interventions and efforts leading to the development of vaccines.

 

Screenshot from the webinar “Genetic Sequencing Research: Mutation of SARS-Cov-2 (Implications for Clinical Management and Vaccine Development)” aired on July 17, with replay available on the TVUP YouTube channel.

 

Dr. Saloma’s webinar presentation revolved around the importance of genomic information, how genomics and genome sequencing of the virus can inform decision-making, testing and management of the disease, and what steps should be taken in the future.  She showed the sequence variants in isolates or samples collected here in the Philippines from March to July to determine SARS-Cov-2 circulating viruses and come up with transmission analysis. She explained that virus mutations can have implications on vaccine design, testing, and treatment.

Saloma said “China’s release of the SARS-Cov-2 data in January allowed many institutions around the world to develop tests, diagnose the virus, and for vaccine developers to design vaccines based on sequence alone, and for structural modeling studies. . . .  Worldwide, we have a publicly available shared database wherein researchers from all over the world can deposit their sequences.”

 

Screenshot from the webinar “Genetic Sequencing Research: Mutation of SARS-Cov-2 (Implications for Clinical Management and Vaccine Development)” aired on July 17, with replay available on the TVUP YouTube channel.

 

“With whole genome sequencing, we can track sequence variations, and disprove conspiracy theories that say the SARS-Cov-2 is a bioweapon. The data in the field suggest that it wasn’t developed as a bioweapon and that it evolved naturally,” Saloma explained.

“It is important for epidemiologists to study the random mutations in the SARS-Cov-2 genetic code to inform containment measures, to analyze the similarities between the different viruses, and to allow scientists to build a genetic tree,” she added.

Saloma went on to discuss how technology helps researchers understand virus spread. “We can organize samples in the tree according to the date they were taken. This helps us visualize how the virus spread over time. Geographical movement is interpreted based on the location of the samples. It is important that we have very good record-keeping and contact tracing. It helps us analyze how the transmissions take place,” she said.

 

Screenshot from the webinar “Genetic Sequencing Research: Mutation of SARS-Cov-2 (Implications for Clinical Management and Vaccine Development)” aired on July 17, with replay available on the TVUP YouTube channel.

 

Saloma shared valuable information yet to be published. “The data presented are part of the results of the field validation study of the GenAmplify nCov RT-PCR detection kit of Dr. Raul Destura, with the study funded by PCHRD DOST, and the project leader was Dr. Marissa Alejandria,” she said.

“Majority of the analysis was done during the month of April, with samples collected during the last week of March (about 380 cases). Within this period, the number of cases grew from 2,311 (April 1) to 8,488 (April 30),” added Saloma.

UP outgoing president, Alfredo Pascual, gave markers of his administration’s accomplishment and expressed his thanks to the UP community, his executive staff in particular, at the 5th President’s Toast on February 9, 2017, the eve of handing over the UP presidency to his successor.

The event, which opened the Institute of Biology, UP Diliman to the UP community–saw student protesters, as well as chancellors giving thanks on behalf of their constituent universities through their gift of a Toym Imao sculpture. Representatives of UP sectors delivered testimonials to the outgoing UP president.

Pascual cited the administration’s two-pronged strategic plan aimed at academic and operational excellences to achieve a “one UP”. Enabling the administration’s successful implementation of this plan was its campaign for state funding, which saw the UP budget increase almost three-fold, from P5.4 billion in 2011 to P15.1 billion in 2016, mostly in the form of allocations for maintenance and other operating expenses (MOOE), and capital outlay, which amounted to P9 billion in a span of five years, according to the outgoing President.

Pascual’s presentation began with achievements in pursuing academic excellence.

These included enhancing access to UP by poorer segments of society through the online UPCAT application and the free online UPCAT review. Those passing the UPCAT were given better motivation to enroll and chances of staying in UP through a liberalized loan system and a streamlined Socialized Tuition System, including increased stipends, scholarships, and compensation for student assistants.

The roster of faculty was strengthened through increased incentives for the Balik-PhD program, sufficient grants to travel and pursue postgraduate courses abroad, multi-campus offering of doctoral programs, establishment of the One UP Professorial Chairs, and merit promotions."

On October 20, 2018, the University of the Philippines (UP) and the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), led by UP President Danilo L. Concepcion and DPWH Secretary Mark A. Villar, held the groundbreaking ceremony for the UP Student Union Building to be constructed at the back of Vinzons Hall and facing Katipunan Avenue in UP Diliman, Quezon City.

Designed to have a total floor area of 7,800 square meters, the proposed seven (7) storey building will serve as the new home of the University Student Council, the Philippine Collegian, the Office of Student Activities, the University Food Service, various student organizations, shops, and other facilities conducive for students’ activities. The 200-million peso project will be implemented by the DPWH’s Quezon City 2nd District Engineering Office, with its Phase 1 expected to be completed by December 15, 2019.

UPD Chancellor Michael L. Tan welcomed officials and guests. He said that he had many happy memories of the old building, with a bookstore and some shops they frequented as students several decades ago, and being a center of students’ activities even at night. He added that maybe UP can still retain some of the old “heritage” materials to be used again in the new building.

Concepcion envisioned the area to have a bank or ATM machines, a bookstore, restaurants, offices for the students, and a kitchen and a mess hall to be built on the second floor.

Turning Farmers into Scientists – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/turning-farmers-into-scientists/,"


A mother, a farmer, a scientist and a businesswoman is what Maria Lina Raposa is today.

Lina’s place is in the fields as farming has been her life and source of living in a one hectare farm in the agricultural area of Brgy. Maltana, Tampakan, South Cotabato. While farming along with her husband, she is on to greater dis­coveries as she learns about new farming technologies and experiments. She has also found her passion in processing sweet delicacies by growing her own ingredients—and adding business into the equation.

Moving from being a homemaker to a household name in Tampakan, Lina owes much of her achievement from a formula that she learned back in 2013. “KKAA,” which stands for Kogi (hard work), Kusog (strength), Antos (sac­rifice) and Ampo (prayer), is what Lina took to heart after earning her place as a member of the pioneering batch of the Farmer-Scientist Training Program (FSTP) in Tampa­kan, South Cotabato that year.

Sowing knowledge, harvesting farmer-scientists

“Lacking in scientific farming technology, the farmers only produce low yields for their families. Thus, they re­main poor and hungry and peace and order is a perennial problem. This was basically the situation in Cebu, where we started our extension work in 1994,” the Cebuano scientist and FSTP project leader Romulo Davide says. Dr. Davide is a Professor Emeritus at UP Los Baños and a Ramon Magsaysay awardee for his work with farmers.

“In response and to address the poverty of poor farmers, especially those in the upland mountainous communities, I conceived a program that was specifically designed to liberate the poor farmers from the bondage of poverty and hunger based on the assumption that farming is business. The farmers will not only grow corn but also staple crops like sweet potato, cassava, vegetables, fruit crops and other crops of commercial value and integrate them with back­yard animal production,” according to Dr. Davide.

He further explains that “FSTP is based on the premise that farmers are smart individuals who by themselves can become scientists who implement and design experiments to arrive at useful conclusions with the guidance of scien­tists.” In the FSTP program, farmers have to go through three phases, namely: Phase I: farmers do research with the scientists in the field and also learn values for love of God, country and people. They design and conduct experiments that include land preparation, varietal and fertilizer trials, intercropping, among others, which is the initial and technical part of FSTP for the farmers to become farmer-scientists.”

New Homes for Sports and Wellness – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/new-homes-for-sports-and-wellness/,"


Be it on the lines, on the lanes, at the nets, on the courts, on the fields or on the floor, UP’s athletes have made history and a name in sports. While they may be struggling today to recover lost luster in some areas, the University’s Maroons were not named “Fighting” for nothing.

New blood, new coaches, and new management with a new game plan will make that happen. After all, UP is a university like no other. Its charter puts sports squarely in the context of “training and learning in leadership, responsible citizenship, and the development of democratic values, institutions and practice through academic and non-academic programs, including sports, and the enhancement of nationalism and national identity.”

But to meet these lofty goals, the University needs to provide its athletes—and anyone else interested in health and wellness—with the proper facilities for training and competition. And true to its mission, UP has not been remiss in making this possible.

And while UP Diliman, being the largest constituent university, often hogs the headlines—its new sports complex will soon boast a new football field, football stadium, and track oval—encouraging initiatives in sports and wellness have been arising elsewhere across the System.

Mindanao’s “Mecca of Sports”

One of these bright new spots can be found in UP Mindanao, which has worked closely with the City Government of Davao to put up a sports complex aimed at serving as “a unifying venue to showcase the common and distinctive social, cultural, indigenous heritage and identity of the people of Mindanao through the development of sports and human kinetics.”

Construction of the Multi-Purpose Building (Football Stadium Phase (Photo by DPWH XI)

According to Cherrylyn F. De Leon-Cabrera of UP Mindanao, the idea for the DC-UP Sports Complex began in 1998 with the creation of the Mayor Elias B. Lopez Sports Foundation, Inc. (MELSF) to oversee the planning and management of a sports complex inside the UPM campus as well as the administration and sustainability of the city’s sports programs.

But things really took off only in 2013 when then Mayor Rodrigo R. Duterte revived the plan for a sports complex in Davao, spurring meetings between the city government and UP. In April 2015, the Davao City Council authorized Mayor Duterte to sign an MOU with UP, and in July, the BOR authorized President Alfredo E. Pascual to do the same for UP. The MOU was then signed on August 6, 2015.

Under the MOU, UP Mindanao will provide a 20-hectare site for the complex, while the City of Davao will provide and develop the infrastructure facilities at par with international standards.

This so-called “Mecca of Sports” draws on many inspirations: the Canberra Stadium in Australia; the Yankee Stadium in New York, USA; and Camp Nou in Barcelona, Spain. Its Human Kinetics Center looks back on the Australian Institute of Sports, the National Institute of Sports in India, and the Institute of Sports of the Heidelberg University in Germany.

According to its site development plan, the DC-UP Sports Complex envision a sports venue that will have a training gym; a football stadium; a football field; a track oval; an aquatics center; a sports arena/coliseum; a medical center and athletes’ dormitory; open and public areas for hiking, skateboarding, among others; a multi-level public transportation terminal and parking areas; as well as a tree-road network.

Working closely with the University’s Office of the Vice President for Development, the construction of the following facilities is underway:

Training gym.The basket-like structure is taken from the handy container that the indigenous people of Mindanao use for food and goods. This functions as a sun-shade to the building, with its façade and windows in triangular shapes symbolizing the IP’s dominant symbol.

Concreting/Improvement of the UP Mindanao-Manambulan Road. The P50-million construction of a two-lane road along the upper perimeter of the sports complex is ongoing, being handled by the 2nd District Engineer’s Office (2DEO).

Multi-Purpose Building (Football Stadium Phase 1).The football stadium is being constructed in phases based on the available budget allotment for this site. Its initial budget of P50 million will build a 1,300-seater facility, which will house two locker rooms with bath and comfort rooms for the playing teams; office spaces for the FIFA as well as the local organizing committee (LCO); medical and doping rooms; a VIP room; a sports commentators’ room; public restrooms; and viewing areas especially made for PWDs and the like.

Multi-Purpose Building (Football Stadium Phase 2). Another P50-million endowment from the 2016 Local Infrastructure Program (LIP) of the DPWH XI-2DEO has enabled the Multi-Purpose Building (Football Stadium Phase 2) to be constructed, and it will extend Phase 1’s seating capacity by around 2,000. This will also house the “mixed zone” area, where it will hold the meet-and-greet between spectators and athletes, as well as provide a media holding area."
Flourish in the rubbish – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/flourish-in-the-rubbish/,"Flourish in the rubbish
July 28, 2017 | Written by Stephanie Cabigao



Waste management has been a great challenge, especially in highly populated cities around the world. Nations have been creative now more than ever in formulating and implementing environmental initiatives, policies, as well as programs on waste disposal and management.

The Philippines has Republic Act 9003 also known as the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000, which enforces solid waste management and compliance with the 50 percent waste-reduction target.

The University of the Philippines, as the country’s national university, is mandated to lead and benchmark new strategic programs which contribute to sustainable environmental development. UP thus established Green UP, which “aims to contribute policy options across the system, including green building standards, energy audits, replacement of equipment to improve energy efficiency, water and solid waste management, monitoring of building maintenance standards, environmental management and other strategic initiatives in relation to climate change, disaster risk reduction and sustainability.”

The UP Diliman Task Force on Solid Waste Management (UPD-TFSWM) had earlier been created through Administrative Order No. 99-25 issued by former UP Diliman Chancellor Claro T. Llaguno on July 21, 1999 in fulfillment of RA 9003. Its main objective was to provide the entire UP Diliman community with an alternative means of effective solid waste management, as garbage generation on campus continues to be a serious problem to contend with, according to Engr. Kristian July R. Yap, the head of the UPD-TFSWM.

Today, the UPD-TFSWM is a comprehensive and dynamic hub that has developed from a waste management site into an integrated model urban farm, research laboratory, and educational facility.

200 kilos a day

The UPD-TFSWM is focused mainly on municipal solid wastes, namely biodegradables (food and yard wastes) and recyclables. It does not handle hazardous wastes.

It has implemented “integrated waste management operations” which involve a daily collection of about 200 kilos of food waste from UP housing areas within the campus, excluding dormitories. Also, a drop-in system for food wastes from campus canteens and restaurants collects about 90-100 kilos of food waste per day, according to Anna Lyn F. Yumul, UPD-TFSWM administrative staff member.

In November 2015, The Department of Science and Technology (DOST) donated the DOST-ITDI Bioreactor, a 500-kilogram capacity machine, which processes both yard and food waste into organic compost. UPD-TFSWM conducts a 24/7 processing and production of compost, and provides machine maintenance yearly.

“UPD-TFSWM conducts daily processing of food wastes from campus residential areas, University canteens as well as restaurants, as well as processing of yard waste collected by the Campus Maintenance Office (CMO) and Brgy. UP Campus, then turning them into compost through conventional and bioreactor-facilitated curing using inoculants and microbes,” Anna Lyn confirmed.

Pinakbet and tinola on the ground

Aside from operation and maintenance, UPD-TFSWM is also developing its materials recovery facility into an organic vegetable garden by utilizing its compost products and scientific farming methods.

“The facility makes use of its compost product for its organic farming and production of vegetables such as okra, gabi, ampalaya, kalabasa, kamote tops, pechay, lettuce, as well as basil, oregano, dill, and mint herbs depending on the season,” Anna Lyn said.

In the garden, herbs along with various ornamentals are grown in sub-irrigated planters, which are makeshift plant pots from recycled plastic soda bottles. Meanwhile, fruit and vegetables, such as pineapple, yam, pandan and dragon fruit, grow in soil plots.

Vegetable patches can also be found. One is called “pinakbet patch”, which combines the growing of amplaya and kalabasa; and another is the “tinola patch”, that cultivates native sili together with papaya. Pairing these plants together is based on the organic farming method of combining complementary plants that protect each other from their respective pests, according to Yumul. Organic insecticides, such as ginger and chilli pepper, are also used.

Vermiculture is another feature of the facility. “This is a nutritious compost that we are introducing to our consumers and into our farming production,” Yap said. “We have expanded its scope to increase production, at the same giving us an additional source of income,” he added.

Recently, the team has also started its poultry raising and production with a newly procured incubator facility. It began selling fresh organic eggs from native chickens, as well as from a particular breed called “Cobra,” to campus staff and residents, also walk-ins from outside the campus.

Research

UPD-TFSWM is currently hosting two research projects in two greenhouses. One is a vetiver research project by a graduate student, an explorative study on the absorption of heavy metals contained in water. Another involves two groups of undergraduate chemical engineering students, one focused on the improvement of compost production, and the other on ways of turning waste into energy through the production of biogas from waste.

Public service initiatives

The facility also conducts training seminars on solid waste management for campus building administrators and maintenance staff, and helps set up composting areas in academic buildings and dormitories, among other public service initiatives."

It was not the ideal way to close the first round of the University Athletics Association of the Philippines (UAAP) Season 82 basketball eliminations in the seniors division. UP lost to Ateneo de Manila University (ADMU) in women’s and men’s basketball on September 29 at the Smart Araneta Coliseum.

The Lady Maroons, looking to clinch their first win this season, went up against the Lady Eagles, who were gunning to end their four-game losing streak. In the end, UP struggled to keep up with ADMU and ended the game with a 14-point deficit, 62-76.

UP started slow as the end of the first quarter saw it trailing by nine, 16-25. But the Lady Maroons rallied, banking six two-point field goals and four out of eight charity shots, for a total of 16 added points in the second quarter. The Lady Eagles meanwhile, only managed ten, owing to two triples, two from the line, and one from the field.

With only a three-point lead by Ateneo at the end of the first half, 35-32, UP was ready to battle it out in the third. But an early 6-0 run by the Blue and White team stopped the Maroon and Green squad from scoring. That is, until Lulu Ordoveza broke through with a basket from an inbound pass, which was then countered by Nicole Cancio’s two.

Lady Maroon Rhea Sanchez replied, booking a back-to-back two and three, all within thirty seconds. Teammate Patricia Pesquera followed up with another two, for the 7-0 run, which was halted by a two-pointer from Ateneo’s Katrina Guytingco. Foul trouble soon followed UP, with Guytingco sinking five of six shots from the line. Despite two more baskets on the Maroon side by Erica Gusilatar and Pesquera, the third quarter ended with UP behind by ten, 47-57.

And the onslaught continued. As in the previous quarter, the Lady Maroons scored 15 points, not enough against the Lady Eagles’ 19. At the end of the first round, UP’s scorecard in women’s basketball is 0-7.

Later that day, the Fighting Maroons faced the Blue Eagles in the much hyped first meeting since facing off in the Season 81 finals.

It was as tense as expected, with a good amount of cheering and jeering from the almost 20,000-strong crowd, plenty of shouts on calls and non-calls from both Blue and Maroon sides, and four technical fouls to boot. Add the ejection of UP Head Coach Bo Perasol and it certainly was an explosive way to end the first round of the UAAP men’s basketball tournament.

Despite its hot start, ending the first quarter with a six-point lead at 21-15, UP was unable to keep its momentum and eventually lost to Ateneo, 63-89.

Top-seed ADMU started pulling away in the second quarter with three runs that limited UP’s quarter points to ten. Blue Eagle SJ Belangel’s two charities off a foul called on Kobe Paras less than twenty seconds in, were answered by Ricci Rivero in the paint. Then the 7-0 run by Ateneo happened. Paras barged through Ange Kouame’s defense at the 04:17 mark to halt the string of Blue baskets.

ADMU retaliated with another run at 6-0, only to be stopped by Kouame’s foul on UP center Bright Akhuetie, who aced his points from the line. He later tapped the ball off Blue Eagle Thirdy Ravena’s dribble toward fellow Maroon Janjan Jaboneta, who then passed the ball to Paras before crossing the court to make two inside points. Kouame then sank a two, followed by Matt Nieto, who got a bonus free throw from another foul slapped on Paras. Kouame was also called for another foul against Akhuetie, who made two for two again. UP was down by four at the end of the first half, 31-35.

Ateneo started building a solid lead against UP in the third quarter, the most heated and controversial part of the match. This quarter saw two technical fouls for excessive complaining. The first, called on ADMU Head Coach Tab Baldwin less than two minutes in. The second was on Akhuetie less than a minute later, immediately after a personal foul had just been called on him and he had already crossed to the other court.

Around two minutes later, Fighting Maroons Head Coach Bo Perasol charged into the playing court while the ball was live, confronting Referee Jaime Rivano. He got a disqualifying foul and was ejected from the game. The Blue Eagles were up by 12 points then, 47-35. Assistant Coach Ricky Dandan took over in Coach Perasol’s absence, but UP’s 15 points was no match for ADMU’s 26. The third quarter ended with a 15-point lead for Ateneo, 61-46."

“Cohesion was our number one problem in the first round.”—UP Fighting Maroons Head Coach Bo Perasol (Photo by Misael Bacani, UP MPRO)

 

UP Fighting Maroons Head Coach Bo Perasol was blunt in his assessment of the team’s first round performance in the University Athletics Association of the Philippines (UAAP) men’s basketball tournament. “That’s the bottom line. . . . It’s not that we could have done better as far as standings [go], but we could have done better in terms of execution and cohesion.”

He acknowledged how strong the playing field this season has been thus far. And while he is happy with the team’s victories, he knows the team can still improve.

Injuries during the pre-season prevented the completion of the roster in training and matches. Bright Akhuetie, Juan Gomez de Liaño, Kobe Paras, and Ricci Rivero were unable to complete or attend some training programs because they needed to recover. So, the first round was a story of how the Fighting Maroons tried to find their way as a team. “And even with that situation, we managed to win.”

Perasol said of the four, “Bright and Kobe have shown what they can do. Juan and Ricci haven’t reached the peak of their performance yet.”"

Fighting Maroons win another close game
September 28, 2019 by Jo. Florendo B. Lontoc

With its fourth straight win, UP raises its scorecard to 5-1. The only team left to battle in the UAAP Season 82 men’s basketball first round games is its finals rival last season, the Ateneo Blue Eagles.

First game, first win. The UP Fighting Maroons took the Far Eastern University (FEU) Tamaraws by the horns to win its Season 82 opener in the University Athletics Association of Philippines (UAAP) men’s basketball tournament on September 4 at the Smart-Araneta Coliseum.

The Big Dome echoed with chants from both maroon, and green and gold sides as UP, last season’s runner-up, clashed with Season 81’s fourth place finisher. A formidable opponent, FEU, along with De La Salle University, has the highest number of semifinals appearances since UAAP instituted the final four format in 1993.

The Tamaraws drew first blood with Ken Tuffin shooting from beyond the arc. UP pushed back with a 7-0 run coming from Jun Manzo’s three-pointer and back-to-back dunks by Bright Akhuetie and Ricci Rivero. With less than a minute left in the tight first quarter, Juan Gomez de Liaño sank a trey that broke FEU’s two-point lead. Another basket from his brother Javi closed the first quarter at 20-17.

The Maroon squad asserted its dominance in the second quarter, successfully staving off FEU’s field goal attempts for almost four minutes. Two consecutive three-point shots by King Maroon Noah Webb and Rivero gave UP a double-digit lead at 32-22 with a little over four minutes remaining in the quarter. The team from Morayta failed to close the gap and the first half ended at 38-27.

It seemed the halftime break cooled the Fighting Maroons a bit too much as they struggled to keep up with the charging Tamaraws back on the court. Scoring only nine points against FEU’s seventeen, UP’s 11-point lead in the first half dwindled to three, 47-44, at the end of the third quarter."

It was a Sunday of runs and rallies until the clock stopped ticking.

In their second round opener of the UAAP men’s basketball on October 6 at the MOA Arena, the UP Fighting Maroons challenged the Far Eastern University (FEU) Tamaraws, but were not able to survive the attack in overtime, 82-79.

The scenario was reminiscent of the teams’ meeting last season in the first round. UP was without Head Coach Bo Perasol, who was suspended, following his ejection from a previous game with Ateneo. The Fighting Maroons were supposed to face the University of Santo Tomas Growling Tigers, but the match was postponed due to bad weather, so that Perasol served his suspension in UP’s next game versus FEU. The Maroons lost to the Tams by 16 points, 73-89.

This time, the Morayta squad was looking to avenge its first round loss to UP, while the team from Diliman was on a “We BOlieve” campaign for their head coach, wanting to notch another win and strengthen its hold on the second spot.

FEU started off strong, making 18 points and limiting UP points to five. But the last four minutes of the first quarter saw a 12-0 run, with Kobe Paras putting in eight and Bright Akhuetie making four. Four of Paras’s points were from his slick back-to-back snatches, one of which resulted in a flawless back and forth with Jaydee Tungcab into a highlight jam. At the end of the first 10-minute rollercoaster ride, the Fighting Maroons were behind by only a point, 17-18.

The second quarter saw UP taking the lead by three after baskets from Javi Gomez de Liaño and Tungcab less than three minutes in. But FEU was relentless, going toe-to-toe and shooting two consecutive hoops from beyond the arc courtesy of Wendell Comboy and Ken Tuffin. It was attack and counter-attack from then on, with UP ending the second quarter three points down, 27-30.

Tungcab’s three-pointer tied the game at the beginning of the second half, which Tamaraw Xyrus Torres answered with a three, followed by LJ Gonzales’s three-point play off Maroon Juan Gomez de Liaño’s foul. Akhuetie and Javi Gomez de Liaño banked four more for UP and FEU retaliated with 11 straight points, stretching its lead to 13. Paras sank two, but the Tamaraws gored through the Maroon defense and marked the biggest lead in the game at 19. The third quarter closed with UP trailing by 17, 43-60.

Going into the fourth quarter, the Fighting Maroons chipped away at the deficit, and less than two minutes in, were able to reduce the gap to ten. Sensing another Maroon surge and wanting to nip it quick, the Tams drove its lead to 16 with six minutes left in regulation.

The Fighting Maroons snatched a razor-thin victory, 72-71, from the Green Archers, who had led for almost 39 minutes of the 40-minute regulation time on September 25, 2019 at the Mall of Asia Arena. With its fourth straight win, UP raises its scorecard to 5-1. The only team left to battle in the UAAP Season 82 men’s basketball first round games is its finals rival last season, the Ateneo Blue Eagles.

UP’s fourth-quarter game was propelled and brought home by three-pointers from injury-laden point guard Juan Gomez de Liaño early and in the last eight seconds of the quarter. Juan took the cudgels for the team who saw lead scorers Kobe Paras and Bright Akhuetie reduced to 21-percent and 35-percent field goal shooting, respectively.

The Maroons trailed in the first two quarters, 14-18 and 29-36, and began the fourth with a seven-point deficit, 52-59. Successful free throws by Bright, a fast-break shot by Jaydee Tungcab and a three-pointer by Juan, closed the gap at 59-61. Kobe sunk his penalty shots to tie the game, 61-61.

The Archers gallantly fought back, with Andrei Caracut and Aljun Melecio serving a trey each. With barely a minute left in the game, the Archers led by four points, 67-71. Kobe then sank another pair of penalty shots to narrow the gap to two, 69-71. In the last 49 seconds, Bright fouled out of the game, but foul receiver Archer Jamie Malonzo was zero on the line.

With the last quarter of the minute ticking away, Juan stole the ball from a pass by Aljun toward Archer territory, crossed to UP court, and made the quick and decisive trey with seven seconds left in the game. The clutch basket stunned the Archers into wasting away their succeeding possession.

“The biggest shot came from Juan, and he’s not even a hundred percent yet when he took that shot,” Fighting Maroons coach Bo Perasol said post-game. “But once a player is a winner, he’s always a winner, so I didn’t have a doubt in my mind when he was bringing the ball down that he was going for the three-point shot. In fact what I was looking at were his feet.”

The UP Fighting Maroons gained enough lead in the first half to buffer itself from an NU Bulldogs barrage in the second, managing an 80-77 win in their UAAP second round match-up on October 23 at the Smart Araneta Coliseum. UP inched closer to the Final Four as it solidified its second-place ranking after the Ateneo Blue Eagles.

Kobe Paras, Bright Akhuetie, Jun Manzo, and Juan Gomez de Liaño all scored in double digits: 19, 16, 14, and 11, but were collectively eclipsed by NU’s 24, 20, 12, and 10 courtesy of Dave Ildefonso, JV Gallego, Migs Oczon, and Shaun Ildefonso, respectively.

Although UP proved to have the more rounded team,  with Ricci Rivero, Noah Webb, Javi Gomez de Llano, and Jerson Prado chipping in 8, 5, 4, and 3, respectively; as against the rest of the Bulldogs who only managed to add 11 points to the team score.

UP’s biggest lead came early in the second quarter with a three-pointer by Juan Gomez de Liaño bringing UP’s score up to 26 over NU’s 12.

The Bulldogs prevailed in the third quarter. Oczon exploded with three straight threes, followed by Dave Ildefonso’s steal and shoot combo plus another basket. Ildefonso tied the game at 56 with another three-point shot early in the fourth quarter.

UP responded with two treys from Manzo and inside baskets from Akhuetie, Javi Gomez de Liaño, and Rivero, bringing UP up by seven, 74-67.

But the Bulldogs bit back harder. Gallego sank two baskets and Dave Ildefonso shot a three and a charity to make eight points that kept NU alive despite another Maroon trey from Paras. NU was only down by three with less than a minute left, 75-77.

UP and UST exchanged leads 17 times, before the Fighting Maroons succumbed to the Growling Tigers’ defense and stunning perimeter scoring in their second UAAP Season 82 match-up on October 16 at the Mall of Asia Arena. UP lost to UST again, 78-84, for a 6-4 win-loss record and, still, solo second standing after Ateneo de Manila University.

UST scored their first 15 points with three consecutive and two consecutive three-pointers by CJ Cansino and Sherwin Concepcion, respectively—a barrage overcome nonetheless by Kobe Paras, Jun Manzo, and David Murrell, who also succeeded in their three-pointers, and by Bright Akhuetie scoring inside. But UP’s 19-15 lead was wiped out by double three-pointers by Concepcion and Zac Huang. The first quarter ended at 22-23 in favor of UST.

UST began padding its lead early in the second quarter. It was almost midway through the quarter and the score was 27-36, the Tigers’ biggest lead, when Paras hurt his right shoulder from landing full-impact near the UP baseline after his drive was blocked by Soulemane Chabi Yo. Around a minute later, UST’s Mark Nonoy twisted his ankle after stepping on Juan Gomez de Liaño’s foot upon landing from a three-point attempt. Paras and Nonoy had to be sent to the dugout for medical attention, but both managed to return in the second half.

The rest of the second quarter was highlighted by Ricci Rivero scoring eight points for UP, the last six from two consecutive treys that countered the three-pointers by UST’s Renzo Subido and Concepcion. But it was not enough to conquer the lead. The quarter ended at 41-48.

The third quarter was an uphill but gainful offense for the Maroons as they scored 16 points over the Tigers’ 12. At the end, UST’s lead was down to three, 57-60.

The UP Fighting Maroons failed to snatch a win against the Ateneo Blue Eagles in the elimination rounds of UAAP Season 82’s men’s basketball tournament. The score was 86-64 in favor of Ateneo in the last game of the second round on October 30 at the Mall of Asia Arena. Despite the loss, UP had already secured the number two spot with a twice-to-beat advantage in the semifinals by winning against De La Salle University in its previous outing.

UP led at the end of the first quarter, 21-20. It started out as a back-and-forth of field goals between the Maroons and Eagles, with a pair of twos and a couple of threes from UP, and four twos and a trey from Ateneo. After 6.63 minutes of play, Blue only had a point over Maroon, 11-10. But UP had already incurred four fouls against Ateneo’s one.

While UP continued sinking baskets from the field, adding nine points plus two from charities, it also raked in more fouls in the last 3.37 minutes. Ateneo sank all of its nine from the line, which made up the rest of its 20 points for the quarter.

The Blue Eagles stretched their lead to 13 at the end of the first half, 45-32, courtesy of 4-0, 7-0, and 12-0 runs, punctuated by a two with 27 seconds remaining. The Fighting Maroons’ 11 points in the second quarter were from Janjan Jaboneta’s basket and two free throws, David Murrell’s save in the paint, Kobe Paras’s three from Jun Manzo’s long inbound pass, and Bright Akhuetie’s inside bucket at 0:39.0 on the quarter clock.

Season 81’s MVP Bright Akhuetie led the Fighting Maroons with the game’s highest 19 points and 16 rebounds on their second match, September 6, 2019 at Smart Araneta, in UAAP Season 82 men’s basketball first-round games. But the team’s effort proved inadequate against the UST Growling Tigers’ scoring prowess. UP suffered a crushing 69-85 loss, fresh from winning its first game with the FEU Tamaraws three days prior.

Ricci Rivero drew first blood with a three-pointer, followed by Akhuetie and Noah Webb’s inside and penalty shots, resulting in the Fighting Maroons’ biggest lead, 12-6. The Tigers then unleashed a rally buoyed by Rhenz Abando’s trey. Three consecutive shots by Dave Ando finally broke UP’s lead and sealed UST’s advantage, 14-19, which UP would not be able to surmount.

Saddled by a 37-44 lead by UST after the first half, UP’s hope was regained on the third quarter as David Murrell and Javi Gomez de Llano’s successful shots narrowed UST’s lead, until Murrell’s follow-up shot tied the game at 46-46 halfway through the quarter. UST’s Chabi Chabiyo was quick, however, to wrest the lead back for UST. The third quarter ended with UST’s lead down to five, 58-63.

They were down by 12 twice in the first three minutes of the fourth quarter. And then it happened. That re-energized Fighting Maroon spirit emerged, eager to bounce back from a previous game’s defeat. That hunger for victory powerfully played out in a 21-5 run in the last seven minutes of the game.

Adamson started the game aggressively, gaining first possession and pummeling UP with an 11-2 run three minutes in. The Falcons were driven to sink their claws into the Maroons, who have had no success against the UP dribblers since last season’s semifinals, when the Maroons blanked their twice-to-beat advantage and secured the finals berth. That drive to defeat UP ended the first quarter with Adamson up by eight, 19-11.

The Fighting Maroons shook off their sluggish start and worked harder, making 25 points in the second quarter against the Soaring Falcons’ 18. Jun Manzo started with a putback from his own miss, less than a minute into the quarter. Kobe Paras went from zero in the first quarter to nine in the second. Juan Gomez de Liaño made eight. Bright Akhuetie added six.

On the Falcons side, Val Chauca continued his assault in the second quarter, contributing six more to his 11 in the first. But even with Jerrick Ahanmisi, Vince Magbuhos, Egie Mojica, and Joshua Yerro putting in the points to try and pad the Adamson lead, the San Marcelino squad only managed to step away with a one-point advantage over the Diliman team at the end of the first half, 37-36.

The UP Fighting Maroons prevailed once again over the DLSU Green Archers, 71-68, on October 27 at the Ynares Sports Center, Antipolo, Rizal, in their second round matchup for the UAAP Season 82 Men’s Basketball elimination rounds. The Maroons were thus assured of the second seed and its twice-to-beat advantage in the semifinal with a 9-4 win-loss record.

The feat looked easy in the beginning with UP gaining its biggest lead, 16 points, at 27-11, early in the second quarter. But this was followed by a 21-0 rally by the Archers in the same quarter, which rendered the Maroons visibly rattled: Bright Akhuetie committed a three-second violation, and Juan Gomez de Liaño badly missed a three-pointer. Archer Brandon Bates was unguarded when he gave his team the lead, 29-27, through a layup, with 1:38 left in the quarter. This was followed by him emphatically blocking a Rivero one-hand dunk; then by Aljun Melecio sinking a three-pointer, giving the Archers their biggest lead at 32-27.

UP got its bearings back with Akhuetie breaking the Archer rally at the 0:54 mark, then sinking a charity and promptly following these up with a basket to tie the game at 32. The quarter ended with UP getting back the lead, 35-34, with a Jun Manzo three-pointer at 0:11.

UP ended the third quarter with a 10-point lead, 55-45. But La Salle made a come-back in the fourth with a 9-0 run from its 57-62 deficit, beginning with two charities by Justine Baltazar and a basket by Encho Serrano. La Salle made a steal after Serrano’s failed charity, which Melecio tried to convert to a three-pointer, at which point he was fouled by Paras. Melecio sank all three on the line, giving La Salle a two-point advantage over UP, 64-62. He extended the lead to four with a bucket from the edge of the perimeter with 2:54 remaining in the game.

UP responded with Manzo taking advantage of the Archers’ focus on Akhuetie, cutting to the shaded lane from the arc, and making a layup from Akhuetie’s assist. Akhuetie would tip the ball in from a shot by Rivero to lock the game again at 66, at the turn of the last two minutes. DLSU answered back with a Serrano basket making it through the much taller Paras, with 1:35 left in the fourth.

The UP Fighting Maroons closed the men’s basketball tournament of UAAP Season 82 with a podium finish at third place. This after the UST Growling Tigers tore through UP’s second-seed twice-to-beat advantage in the stepladder semifinals to nab the finals berth. In its last UAAP match on November 13 at the MOA Arena, the Diliman squad lost to the team from España by three, 65-68.

UST started and held the lead, even by as much as 12, until UP’s Jun Manzo tied the game at 57, with less than six minutes left in the last quarter. The Fighting Maroons got its first lead, courtesy of Juan Gomez de Liaño’s basket. That lead was taken two points further by Ricci Rivero’s free throws, 61-57.

Then alternating fouls and baskets seesawed the UP lead from four to two to four. As the clock was approaching the last two minutes, Maroon captain Noah Webb fell to floor clutching his left knee after chasing down Mark Nonoy who had ball possession from across the court. No whistle was blown and the ball was still in play. He forced himself to get up and hopped on his right leg to get to the ball which was again in Nonoy’s hands. Webb was called for an unsportsmanlike foul, which Nonoy successfully converted, cutting down the UP lead to two, 63-61.

Seconds later, Kobe Paras smashed the rim with a highlight off a pass from Javi Gomez de Liaño, to put the UP lead back up to four, 65-61. This was later pushed down to two again through Rhenz Abando’s layup with 1:15 left.

But it was Tiger Renzo Subido’s three-pointer at the 24-second mark that turned back the Maroon lead, giving UST a narrow edge as the game clock winded down, 66-65. Two charities by Soulemane Chabi Yo at 4.4 seconds remaining clinched a three-point lead for UST, all the way to victory.

The UP Fighting Maroons and the UST Growling Tigers are now on equal footing as both are one win away from securing the remaining UAAP Season 82 Men’s Basketball finals berth, after UST’s 89-69 win over UP in the first stepladder semifinals game on November 10 at the Smart Araneta Coliseum.

UP, swallowing a three-game sweep by UST of their matches this season and losing their twice-to-beat advantage as second seed, was left with one last chance to beat UST on November  13 at the Mall of Asia Arena, for the best-of-three finals slot against the undefeated Ateneo de Manila Blue Eagles.

Juan Gomez de Liaño took the cudgels for the Maroons, scoring 20, his season’s best. Bright Akhuetie remained a top-scorer with 19; but season top-scorer Kobe Paras was reduced to a low nine, and point guard Jun Manzo, to zero.  Ricci Rivero was within his average at 12 points, making half of these in the last two minutes, when he returned to play after being substituted for scrapes on his right hand.

UST’s Rhenz Abando, Soulemane Chabi Yo, Mark Nonoy, Sherwin Concepcion, and CJ Cansino all scored double-digit. Abando, Nonoy, and Concepcion sank half of their three-point attempts for a total 27 points of the team’s 33 from outside the perimeter, as against UP’s total of nine, all from Gomez de Liaño.

If you think cacao is only good for making chocolate, think again.

Scientists from UP Los Baños (UPLB) have discovered and developed a new product that comes from a most unlikely source, one that’s considered waste—the cacao pod husk.

At the Food and Feed Laboratory of the UPLB National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (BIOTECH), researchers Tess Ramirez and Arcie Sapin have found a viable dietary fiber source in the husk that’s discarded after the precious cacao beans have been harvested from the pod to make chocolate. They processed the husk, treated it with enzymes, and developed a powder as food supplement for human consumption.

“It’s high-fiber, high-protein, and rich in antioxidants,” Sapin said. Ramirez added that when they sent it to the UPLB College of Veterinary Medicine (CVM) for feeding trials, “CVM happily reported that it was low on the Glycemic Index and actually lowered the blood glucose levels of the diabetic lab mice they tested.”

The trials involved feeding the mice with the cacao pod husk powder, a commercially available dietary fiber supplement, and glibenclamide, an anti-diabetes drug. It also included one that wasn’t given any drug or supplement at all. Among all the mice, the ones who were fed the BIOTECH product had fasting blood sugar level results comparable to those who were fed glibenclamide."

Building a soul for Diwata – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/building-a-soul-for-diwata/,"Building a soul for Diwata
October 30, 2018 | Written by Andre DP Encarnacion

For much of his stay at Japan’s Tohoku University, there was little Ariston Gonzalez could do to ease the grind of his daily shift. At times the process of satellite-building seemed more hard labor than scholarship. Even for this UP-trained engineer, each repetitive motion hardly seemed to lead to the near-miracle of creating what essentially became a tumbling box in space that could obey commands.

Take the case of the humble nut and bolt. Where in previous projects, Gonzalez could twist away to his heart’s content, the life cycle of each of his bolts followed strict protocols. There were quality control protocols, cleaning protocols, and even protocols for proper torqueing. “But here was where I learned that every detail matters,” he says. “Because if one bolt fails, everything could fail.”

Indeed, what followed was the opposite of failure. In April 2016 Gonzalez’s little box would rise to fame as Diwata 1, the first ever microsatellite made and designed by Filipinos. Gonzalez, together with three others, was a member of Diwata’s original bus development team. Their crew was tasked not only with building the satellite’s infrastructure, but also providing the sensors that would act as its eyes, the computer that would serve as its brain, and the fans that would serve as its muscles in space.

Expertly tying together all these components made it possible for Gonzalez and the PHL-Microsat team to solve important problems. For instance, how would Diwata know where it was? And once they had a lock on its location, how could they control it? After all, even a satellite with a camera needs to point before it can shoot.

The secret, he says, lies in “attitude control”, the synergistic use of sensors and systems to orient objects like satellites in 3D. And much like the seafarers of old, Gonzalez claims that Diwata’s journey is one that tackles challenges common to all travelers. “How do we get to our destination and where are we even going?”

 

Sea of stars

With his trademark glasses and graphic tee, Gonzalez is fond of his nautical analogies. But instead of a ship on the water, his explanation of attitude control likens Diwata to a vessel in a sea of stars. “Like us, mariners also had tools like telescopes and sextants to chart star relationships. And they had compasses to chart where they were.”

There are multiple phases that go into pointing a satellite. And Gonzalez says, like Moana in the movies, that the first involves using sensing equipment to learn its location and position with respect to certain bodies. Diwata 1, and its successor Diwata 2, have a plethora of such sensors.

First, lining the bodies of both Diwata 1 and 2 are multiple sun aspect sensors (SAS). Holding up a metal square with a reflective center, Gonzalez notes the two purposes of this device. “First it tells us where we are with respect to the sun.” Working like solar cells, the sensors can indicate which side faces the sun when stuck directly by its light.

Second, even in its tumbling state, the sensors can help calculate Diwata’s angle with respect to the sun using light intensity. “When it shines directly on the sensor, that’s typically when it is most intense,” Gonzalez says. As the angle of sunlight moves off-center, typically the intensity decreases, and the onboard computers can calculate a line tracing the satellite’s orientation based on the information.

Because it orbits the earth lower than larger global positioning system (GPS) satellites, Diwata 2 will be able to receive GPS data, much like a typical mobile phone, to measure both position and velocity. But even this only serves to complement Diwata’s geomagnetic sensor (GAS). “We know that the Earth has a magnetic field of its own,” explains Gonzalez. And with different areas on the planet having fields of different magnitudes, the PHL-Microsat team can use the sensor to map the coordinates of Diwata with a considerable degree of precision.

Diwata’s final two sensors are perhaps its most sensitive. While vessels of old used gyroscopes to measure their orientation, Diwata’s fiberoptic gyroscope (FOG) takes this to another level. Instead of rotating wheels, the FOG features optical fiber coils located on three axes. Light is split and made to travel these coils in opposite directions, with rotation on any of these wheels causing interference that delays one beam relative to the other (called the Sagnac effect). “It is so sensitive to rotations,” Gonzalez says, “that just setting it on the table, it can measure the rotation of the Earth.”

Finally, just as the ancients before it, Diwata 2 also uses the stars. Since stars are fairly static landmarks, the microsatellite can utilize its star tracker telescope (STT) to take a snapshot of a region of space. It then compares this snapshot to the 360-degree star gallery included on board Diwata to estimate the satellite’s current attitude and location.

So accurate is the STT that Gonzalez says it is virtually the standalone system behind Diwata’s most precise pointing capability (called “fine attitude determination”) that locks onto a given location with an accuracy of up to 0.1 degrees.

 

High-altitude photographs

When taking a photo in space, however, knowing one’s location is only half the battle. You need to use all this information to take a position and aim. Once Diwata’s central computer has integrated its sensors’ data, it relies on a pair of clever instruments to move properly.

First, to break it from a high-speed tumble, Diwata 2 features three magnetorquers, which are coils with electric current running though them. When turned on, each magnetorquer generates a magnetic field that aligns with the Earth’s own. And, like typical magnets, both fields will lock onto one another—fixing the satellite in a specific orientation.

With the successful deployment of the Maya-1, the first ever U1 cube satellite (CubeSat) built by Filipinos from the International Space Station (ISS) on August 10, 2018, the people behind its success promised that the best was yet to come.

Watching from the UP Electrical and Electronics Engineering Institute’s (UP EEEI) Reading Room, a contingent of officials from the Philippines and Japan joined members of the PHL-Microsat program to witness the real-time release of Maya-1 from the ISS through the Japanese Experimental module, Small Satellite Orbital Deployer (J-SSOD), through the ‘Kibo’ module. This was the same module used to deploy the first Philippine-built microsatellite, Diwata-1, back in 2016.

The contingent was led by Department of Science and Technology (DOST) Secretary Fortunato dela Peña and Consul General Atsushi Kuwabara from the Embassy of Japan. They joined UP President Danilo L. Concepcion, UP Diliman Chancellor Michael Tan, Senior Expert Shigeki Kamigaichi of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), EEEI Director John Richard Hizon, as well as members of the Institute and the press. The event was facilitated by Dr. Joel Joseph Marciano, Jr., program leader of the PHL-MicroSat project,

Maya-1 was designed and constructed primarily by Kyushu Institute of Technology (Kyutech) graduate students, Joven Javier and Adrian Salces, together with their Kyutech advisers under the second iteration of the BIRDS-2 Cube Satellite Project. The BIRDS project is a KyuTech-hosted interdisciplinary effort to assist non-spacefaring countries in building their own miniature satellites. As part of BIRDS-2, Maya-1 was launched together with two other CubeSats: UiTMSAT-1 from Malaysia and the Bhutan-1 from Bhutan.

The University of the Philippines PHL-Microsat Team and the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) achieved another milestone on October 29, 2018, as Diwata-2, the second microsatellite built and designed by Filipinos was launched from the Tanegashima Space Center in Japan via the H-II F40 rocket.

In a viewing session at UP Diliman’s GT-Toyota Auditorium, project leaders of the PHL-Microsat joined their counterparts from government, the Japanese Embassy in Manila, the media and the UP community to witness the launch on the big screen. A more technologically advanced sibling of the groundbreaking Diwata-1 microsatellite, Diwata-2 will orbit at a higher altitude (~620km.), and features an increased lifespan and a sun-synchronous orbit that makes repeated environmental monitoring of specific places possible.

Like its predecessor, Diwata-2 carries a wide field camera (WFC), middle field camera (MFC), high precision telescope (HPT), and spaceborne multispectral imager (SMI) with liquid crystal tunable filter (LCTF). Unlike its predecessor, it features the deployable solar panels for increased power generation output, an enhanced resolution camera (ERC), and two locally-made experimental modules: an Amateur Radio Unit for disaster and emergency communications and a Satellite Orientation Module for increased pointing accuracy.

Diwata-2 was developed, as was Diwata-1, with the mentorship and support of Japan’s Hokkaido University and Tohoku University. It is a pivotal precursor to the next phase of Philippine space technology, called the Sustained Support for Local Space Technology and Applications Mastery, Innovation and Advancement (STAMINA4Space) Program, that aims to build a local industrial base and enhance local space science and engineering expertise towards the establishment of the Philippine Space Agency.

About the Event

President Rodrigo Duterte’s fourth State of the Nation Address (SONA) comes in the wake of the May midterm elections which saw the defeat (or unequivocal rout) of the more liberally- and democratically-minded opposition in both chambers of Congress. In three years, the Duterte administration continues to enjoy high levels of public satisfaction amid its bloody campaign against illegal drugs, the Marawi siege and martial law in Mindanao, and territorial disputes with China, among many others.

In this roundtable discussion, we invite the public to join us and a group of academics and experts on political science, Islamic studies, foreign relations, constitutional law, and economics to discuss and review the achievements and challenges that the current administration face as we reach the midpoint of the Duterte presidency.

The “Alumni Zoomcoming Day” was formally opened on the morning of August 28 with a mass sponsored by the UPV Scintilla Juris Fraternity and the Stella Juris Sorority, followed by the opening program. These were streamed live from the UPV Little Theater. This allowed alumni to attend the Thanksgiving Mass and opening program from the safety of their homes.

Presidents of the various alumni association (AA) chapters gave their messages in the opening program. Among them were: Mr. Artemio P. Pama, Jr of iAmUPHi Alumni Association; Mr. Allan Angelo L. Quimpo of UPAA Aklan Chapter; Mr. Nicolasito S. Calawag, UPAA Antique Chapter; Ms. Harriette Ong-Banzon, representing Mr. Victor A. Tanco, Sr. of UPAA Capiz Chapter; Dr. Gil Joseph F. Octaviano II, representing UPAA Negros Chapter; Judge Ateneones S. Bacale of UPV Tacloban College Alumni Association; and, Atty. Dennis J. Guevara of UPAA Iloilo Chapter. The officers commended the hard work of volunteer alumni during the pandemic and called for continued unity among the alumni and further service to the community.

UPV officials who gave messages along with a video “look-back” at the UPV campuses and colleges were: Prof. Martin G. Genodepa, Vice Chancellor for Planning and Development; Dr. Ramer P. Bautista, Dean of the School of Technology; Prof. Arthur P. Barrido, Jr., Dean of the College of Management; and, Prof. Severa Fe S. Katalbas, Dean of the College of Science and Technology.

The event highlighting the activities, “UPV Alumni Zoomcoming Virtual Reunion and Online Socials,” was held in the evening. Alumni were able to see each other by logging on to the virtual gathering, while others opted to watch the program’s live stream instead. The online reunion allowed alumni in attendance a fun, albeit short, kamustahan or catching up. Even those viewing the live stream sent greetings to their former classmates.

Alumni from various UPV performing groups provided additional entertainment. Among them were: the UPV Choristers Alumni; UP Khoryu Alumni; Ms. Abigail Leguera, a UPV Performa alumna; Mr. Malik Mariano, a UPV Rhapsody alumnus; and, Ms. Kate Fesalboni, a UP Teatro Amakan alumna. The celebrating jubilarian UP High School in Iloilo (UPHSI) Batch 80 also gave an audio-visual presentation.

UPV Chancellor, Dr. Ricardo P. Babaran, welcomed the guests, saying, “We hope that this first Zoomcoming reunion will still allow us all to relive memories of our years in UPV and sustain our longing to reconnect with old friends.” He reported on some of the latest changes, new additions, and improvements to UPV. This included the Oblation’s relocation to the front of the UPV Main Building in the city campus which faces the new Oblation Avenue towards the Delgado St. entrance, which, he said, makes the campus “more welcoming”. He mentioned the new UPHS building, an alumni project, and new infrastructure in the Miagao campus. He thanked the alumni for their continued support to the University.

Assistant Vice President for Public Affairs and UP System Office of Alumni Relations Director Maria Angelica D. Abad greeted the alumni, especially the jubilarians, who were able to attend the “landmark” event. She called on the alumni, whom she considered “drivers in nation building, the pioneers in cutting-edge research, the trail blazers in arts and culture,” to continue to look back to the University and support the scholars especially with the upcoming transition to remote learning.

UP President Danilo L. Concepcion also welcomed the alumni to the “first-ever virtual reunion to be held in UP”. He commended UPV and its alumni’s various initiatives at this time of pandemic. “I am filled with gratitude, humility, and optimism because throughout this period I have seen the UP Visayas community, that includes you, our alumni, rise to your very best,” he said.

Justice Francis H. Jardeleza, retired Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, delivered the keynote address. He paid tribute to the alumni, from the early pioneers to the “movers and shakers”, who were instrumental in the improvements in UPV, from the restoration of the Main Building, to the renovation of the Little Theater and the construction of the Cinematheque and the Graduate and Continuing Education Building. He also lauded “regular” and anonymous donors, who remain supportive of activities that benefit scholars, among others.

Justice Jardeleza ended by announcing the donation of his class, the UPV High School Class of 1965, in the amount of P300,000, for the establishment of the Historical Preservation Initiative, which aims to help in the preservation of the Old High School Building and the Woman’s Club Building.

The event included the UPAA Iloilo Chapter’s recognition and appreciation of the COVID-19 initiatives done by various alumni and alumni groups in the region. These were individuals and organizations that have made a big impact on the pandemic response efforts.

Alumni jubilarians from the classes of 1965, 1980, 1990, 2000, and other alumni, including Senator Franklin Drilon, Chancellor Emeritus Dr. Ida Siason, officers of various UPAA Visayas chapters, UPV officials and personnel, among others, were also in attendance.

UPV OAR Director Prof. Benmar B. Panaguiton formally closed the program. He said this year’s virtual homecoming was a response to the question, “Are we not having anything for the alumni during the homecoming this year?” With the vital role the alumni have taken on to respond to COVID-19, he knew the hosting of these virtual alumni activities by the University was a fitting tribute to them.

“The initial idea was just to have a Zoom meeting where everybody can meet,” which was why it was called a “Zoomcoming,” a virtual reunion. “Eventually it grew as ideas came in,” he added. In collaboration with alumni groups and associations, the colleges, and offices, more activities were added to the week-long homecoming.

In closing, he expressed gratitude to everyone who participated in the week-long online activities, and the various alumni and alumni groups who remain at the forefront of community service during quarantine."

The artist as storyteller – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/the-artist-as-storyteller/,"


Funny Komiks made Mervin Malonzo realize he could tell stories with drawings. His family had just moved into another rental house and the former occupants had left copies lying around. The future magna cum laude graduate and National Book Award winner was in the third grade then.

“I don’t remember a time I wasn’t drawing. And those comics made me decide I wanted to create comics, too.”

Slips and bumps

It hasn’t been easy. “We weren’t rich. My father repaired watches. My mother was a housewife.” He drew on his old notebooks, and an aunt who was a teacher gave him test papers she had finished checking, the blank sides of which he used. That same aunt, who Mervin had thought was encouraging him, also told him he couldn’t make a living out of his illustrations because he “could only succeed if he was good at it.”

Perhaps it was because he was an achiever in school who excelled in math and science that his aunt wanted him to go for a more lucrative career. But even if he was the eldest of five children, his parents never expected him to be the breadwinner. They just told him to “do what made him happy,” so he planned to take up Fine Arts in UP Diliman (UPD) to help him achieve his dream of making comics.

But Mervin didn’t make the cut. He fell short of the required UPD grade. He did qualify for his next choice: BS Chemistry at UP Los Baños.

There he was, disappointed, but ready to put his dream on hold. He had already found a dorm and was set on enrolling. Until he learned that the talent determination test in the Fine Arts program could still get him in.

In 2001, he entered UPD as a Painting major and all throughout, Mervin was a Pitoy Moreno scholar. It wasn’t hard for him to maintain the scholarship grade requirement. The genuine desire to learn that made him excel in his younger years persisted when he entered UP.

“I didn’t struggle too much with the studying part of UP life. Finances were harder to deal with.”

Love, horror, and making a living

He met Princess when she was a freshman at the Asian Institute of Tourism and he was a year from graduating. A friend had given him her number in hopes of setting them up because she was in UP, too; but it was months before he did something about it.

It was December 2013 and he had been living in a relative’s house without electricity for roughly a year. He was continuing to develop the story that had been brewing since he was 17—a story inspired by, but not quite similar to, the characters in Jose Rizal’s Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo, mixed with Philippine mythology and horror, all of which interested him greatly.

“Living alone in a dark house can be scary but I fought that fear through the horror in my story. It was horror I controlled.” But loneliness was another matter, so he reached out to Princess.

To his surprise, they were actually classmates in Natural Sciences 2 and were practically neighbors! They only met in person when classes resumed, and as their relationship developed, so did his story.

After he graduated in 2005, he took on jobs as an in-house artist and designer for some companies. “I wanted to show people I could earn a living as a Painting graduate.” So despite his dream of creating comics, his story, Tabi Po, had to wait.

From beauty queen to iska – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/from-beauty-queen-to-iska/,"

She is just as honest as she was during her final question-and-answer portion at the Miss Universe contest in 2010. But this time, eight years later, she admits that she has a major, major problem when asked why she wanted to take up a master’s degree in Community Development.

“I’ll be very honest with you,” says the towering Bicolana beauty Venus Raj. “I had no idea what Community Development was at first. Someone told me to enroll in it as I was interested in going back to my roots and serving the community. Those were the selling points for me,” she continued.

The Community Development department panel raised the same questions that she, too, had bombarded herself with. “Why did you come here? Of all the courses, why Community Development, and why study? They were thinking, even myself, that I already had a nice job as a television personality, model, beauty queen, so why still pursue this kind of endeavor?”

With these two things in mind—going back to her roots and serving communities—the Bicol University graduate got her chance of a lifetime as the doors of UP opened to her.

One with the community

“I’m telling you, life in UP is way different. Yes, I studied for four years in a university and graduated from my program in Journalism. But when I entered UP, as I said in one of my interviews then, I felt like I was sent to another beauty pageant, go there and compete!” Venus says.

She is thankful to all her professors who guided her along the way. “And I think the one thing that also helped me in painstakingly coping and understanding all the jargon was my classmates,” she emphasizes.

“I have been inspired by my friends, classmates and professors who are working in the various sectors, especially when they speak about empowerment and organizing communities. Then, I would think about my contribution; how do I really do community organizing?”

A relocation site in Bustos, Bulacan opened her eyes to what community organizing really meant. Staying for a month there to fulfill a class requirement, Venus resided along with three other classmates in a vacant housing unit. “During the first week, residents consistently knocked on my door asking for photos with me or an autograph. Of course, from my line of work, it is automatic for me to take selfies with them. But one of the important things I have learned from my professors, when it comes to organizing, is that you should be one of them. You’re an effective organizer when they don’t see you as an outsider. When you’re one with the community, then you’re effective in what you’re doing.”

The star mania died down and eventually she took part in the community customs, food sharing and celebrations. “It is nice that they look at me as part of their community, a neighbor and not an outsider who just came to bring in some kind of charity to the community. It is a very fulfilling experience that gave me the realization that you can empower communities by allowing them to let them know that they can thrive on their own.”

From iska to beauty queen – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/from-iska-to-beauty-queen/,"


To say that beauty pageants are big in the Philippines would be an understatement. Year after year, millions are glued to their TV sets watching Filipinas compete on the international arena as beauty queens become heroes who dominate the national conversation. The battle, however, begins at home and two iskolars are among this year’s Binibining Pilipinas 2018 candidates, both of whom are striving to stand alongside powerful, elegant women such as Theresa Licaros, Venus Raj, Shamcey Supsup, Ariella Arida, and Catherine Untalan.

Driven by dreams

A native of Nasugbu, Batangas, Jerelleen A. Rodriguez, Binibini #25, is a cum laude graduate of BS Business Administration and Accountancy from UP Diliman where she teaches basic and advanced accounting as well as public accounting practice. On the same campus, she is currently taking up law in the UP College of Law. She placed sixth in the accounting board exams and after a brief stint at SGV & Co., she is now also working with small- and medium-sized enterprises to secure funding for their business.

Wynonah Van Joy C. Buot, Binibini #26, hails from Cebu where she graduated from UP with a BA in Mass Communication, cum laude. She worked as an executive assistant to design superstar Kenneth Cobonpue from 2015-2017 after focusing on her modeling career which led to multiple pageant victories, such as Miss UP Cebu in 2012 and Miss Cebu in 2015. She wanted to pursue graduate studies in arts and journalism in New York, but due to constant prodding and encouragement from family and friends, she eventually tried out for Binibining Pilipinas.

At 24, Wynonah wants to be able to tell herself that she was able to accomplish something. Her family has been very supportive, particularly her sister who prodded her, and her mom whom she thinks is a “frustrated beauty queen.” Her supporters keep her going every day. “They help you get up in the morning and motivate you to be someone,” she said.

Joining Binibining Pilipinas had always been Jerelleen’s dream. When she finished high school, she witnessed how Theresa Licaros won the crown and competed while being a law student. Jerelleen even initially applied for the same undergraduate degree program (Broadcast Communication) that Licaros took. She eventually shifted to Accounting for practical reasons and put academics as top priority until she graduated, aced the board exams, and passed the Law Aptitude Examination. After turning 25 last year, she finally decided that it was time to pursue her dream.

However, it is the vision of bringing her family together that truly drives Jerelleen to stay determined to achieve success. She grew up in a family of modest means, and when her father worked overseas to provide for them, she used this as her primary motivation.

UP welcomed the incoming batch of Oblation scholars with a lunch and the awarding of recognition certificates on December 8, 2018 in the Isabelo delos Reyes Auditorium, Bonifacio Hall, UP Diliman.

The Oblation scholarship is awarded to the top 50 freshman qualifiers based on the UP College Admission Test (UPCAT) and University Predicted Grades (UPG). To date, 27 of the 2018 top 50 expressed their intention to enroll in UP.

The 50 topped the 78,949 UPCAT examinees and 12,920 qualifiers of 2018. According to the UP Office of Admissions, they also belong to the first batch of UP freshman applicants to complete the K-12 Program.

Aside from free tuition, the Oblation scholars are entitled to book and transportation allowances every semester, and to monthly incentive allowances. They enjoy the scholarship throughout the normal length of time required to finish their degree program (but only the first four years for those in the Intarmed Program) as long as they maintain the required 2.0 grade average.

According to admissions figures, 70 percent of the top 50 came from public science high schools, 22 percent from private schools, and 8 percent from general public high schools. Fifty-four percent are residents of the National Capital Region; 36 percent, of the rest of Luzon; and 10 percent, of Visayas and Mindanao.

The majority or 92 percent were applicants to UP Diliman, and 8 percent, to UP Manila; 60 percent to Science programs, 36 percent to Engineering programs, and 4 percent to Business programs. As Oblation scholars, however, they are entitled to choose a different undergraduate program in the UP System should they finally decide to enroll in UP.

A high ceiling and sprawling walls provide the sheer vastness required by blown-up images of mounted paintings, such as those in Zean Cabangis’s body of work.

This year’s edition of the world renowned Art Basel in Hong Kong provides the grandest of spaces for about 248 premier galleries from 32 countries and territories. According to a statement of Art Basel Hong Kong, it features “both historical material and cutting-edge works by established and emerging artists”, including Cabangis who is among other selected local artists representing the Philippines.

Hong Kong’s Convention and Exhibition Center displays the creativity behind utilizing such space, which is transformed into a captivatingly large tableau where Cabangis’ work becomes a reverie of impressions, of intersecting images, objects and texts.

“It is a series of paintings depicting places and landscapes that actually show no actual place or, as I call it, no place,” he explains.

Cabangis continues, “About this series, I was trying to show a sense of displacement and uncertainty to one’s feeling of home and sanctuary by putting in multiple layers of familiar images. The title of the works evokes a sense of longingness and of being lost and confused to one’s provenance and direction.”

In the great big world of international art, Zean Cabangis is making it big, for the country and for himself. However, he confesses that this is how he felt while doing his work for Art Basel. He draws parallels between his pieces in this latest exhibit and his personal contemplation as an artist—that he is at a crossroads in his art career with regards to technique and concept. “But in the end,” he says, “I wouldn’t know if I don’t do it and find it out myself.”

He is known for using acrylic and emulsion transfer as his medium. This is a recurring process that allows him to create multiple photographic images and a sensation of accumulated layers, a style that is Cabangis’s signature, but this time, collage is incorporated to add visual depth, for all Art Basel goers to see.

Art as allusion and allegory

Cabangis is as a trained painter whose narrative constitutes a sea of images and objects straight out of film scenes, mainstream media, architecture, nature and mostly from his bike rides. “There’s a lot from which I get the images. I just keep an open mind when I do things, especially the mundane ones, because most of the time that’s when a stream of ideas come in,” he explains."

All Is Fair in Rock and Roll – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/all-is-fair-in-rock-and-roll/,"

The UP Fair 2017 in UP Diliman (Photo from the UP Diliman University Student Council)

 

These days, a rock concert is considered a luxury a regular Isko would have to save up for. Even late-night gigs in the local music scene charge door fees for two to three musical acts plus a bottle of beer. This is why thousands of music lovers eagerly await the annual UP Fair in Diliman, the February Fair in Los Baños and their relatively younger cousin, the UP Manila (UPM) Fiesta in—you guessed it—Manila. For a small fee or even none, fairgoers are treated to local band performances in the comfort of UP campuses.

Opening act

The February Fair in UP Los Baños (UPLB) started as a protest fair during the martial law era in the ‘70s, according to the UPLB University Student Council (USC), which is primarily in charge of organizing the event. It was originally held in September as a way of expressing dissent against the declaration of martial law and the worsening state of the country. This week-long celebration was spearheaded by several organizations in UPLB that eventually made their way into the leadership of the Council of Student Leaders, and then, the UPLB USC.

In Diliman, what started as a simple “perya-like” event, the UP Fair, has evolved into a full-blown celebration of Philippine art, music, and culture—a platform for showcasing UP Diliman’s homegrown talents. Today, it carries with it advocacies as a means of generating awareness of national issues. The UP Diliman USC heads the organizing team of the UP Fair with student organizations serving as night handlers for every UP Fair night. Every year, the UP Fair attracts more than 10,000 people from within and outside the UP community.

In Padre Faura, the UP Manila Fiesta was launched by the UP Manila USC in 2014 as an attempt to make a splash on the music scene like the UP Fair and the UPLB Feb Fair. The cultural arm of the UPM USC, Ugnayan ng Nagkakaisang Artista (UNA), partnered with cultural organizations to organize the first UP Manila Fiesta featuring local talents as front acts as well as rising indie bands. With the help of the UP Manila Musicians Organization, the UP Manila Fiesta has reshaped its format and refocused its goals. Currently, members of Salinlahi, an organization of Philippine Arts majors, make up the executive team as well as volunteers of the UP Manila Fiesta.

True to its roots

The UPLB Feb Fair stayed true to its roots by incorporating relevant issues with pop culture, even after martial law was lifted. Program proposals, sponsorships, and event partnerships are proposed by various organizations, fraternities, sororities, alliances and formations even outside of UPLB to ensure that its audience gets the most out of this unique offering—a concert, a protest, a campout, and a celebration all at the same time (and did I mention it’s free?). To a regular fairgoer, it’s where you can have a date with your significant other, unwind by yourself, have fun with your college barkada, or come back as an alumnus to reminisce your days on campus, while calling for genuine social change.

The UPLB of Their Younger Days – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/the-uplb-of-their-younger-days/,"


 

A year after its founding in 1908, the University of the Philippines established its first campus outside Manila. At the foot of Mt. Makiling, on grounds freshly cleared of jungle, and near rice fields fringing Laguna de Bai, five professors and 12 students, led by a Thomasite dean, Edwin Copeland, pioneered an agricultural school. They were joined by their forestry counterparts the following year.

Some forty years later, students would still see members of the first batches of students and American professors going back to the campus during Loyalty Day, UPLB’s biggest community event. The students would hold them in high regard, not only for the esteemed academic traditions established on campus, but in recognizing them for planting the seeds of a peculiar way of life for their then-small UP community.

Florendo Quebral, who entered UPLB in 1951, was one of those students. He admits to have enjoyed the legacy of rodeos, horse-riding ranchers and grand floats on parade, Halloween, barn dances, and the regular Saturday square and boogie dancing. A couple of years after Quebral arrived in the College, a young Romulo Davide from Cebu would be introduced to this same social scene.

All throughout the sixties, Mimi Cortez, a gregarious college freshman, would see not much difference, coming to UP from nearby San Pablo. She would dress up for the same Rodeo events as a cowgirl in a checkered blouse and balloon skirt, riding on a hay-strewn cart pulled by a tractor. There were new parties though, or names for such, as the newly-coined TGIFs at the Senior Social Garden. Also, she would spot new status symbols on campus which included Impalas and Harley Davidsons, lined outside the party venues.

Thus, the UPLB social scene, like the rest of UP, continued to bustle with modernity of a distinctly imported variety. But like any foreign influence, modernity in the UPLB community had to contend with the overwhelming presence of the local living, reality, and people.

UPLB was a far cry from the America where those traditions originated. And most UPLB students came from diverse Philippine regional backgrounds. For Quebral, Davide, and Cortez, the parties served purposes other and deeper than a relief from boredom or from the rigors of academia. With social events, they had a way of connecting to other and larger circles despite their isolation from family and old ways of life. New circles meant a new independence, social skills, and with it, being part of a distinguishable UPLB way of life.

Davide recalls that early in the 1950s, nurses from the Philippine General Hospital and students from the Philippine Women’s University were invited to UPLB’s social balls, and he was excited to test his burgeoning dating instincts on these visitors. In those days, UPLB, particularly the College of Agriculture, had men far outnumbering the women, and competition among the males was fierce.

And so there was a need to prepare and dress up for the parties, and finding creative means to make good impressions on the ones they fancied. Davide uses the term “pasikatan,” which could mean sartorial, terpsichorean, and other arenas of oneupmanship.

The rigodon de honor holds a special place in Cortez’s heart because, in that formal dance with professors, she got to meet esteemed professors and be treated by them as a peer. During practice, she was thrilled to have them relate to her on first-name basis. Knowing her teachers up close inspired her to achieve more academically.

 

UPLB old campus

 

While students from same provinces and organizations tended to party together, the administration encouraged campus-wide social gatherings, which, given that the campus was still a two-college affair, were easy to manage. Everybody got to know everybody, and once the ice was broken, ensuing parties with other groups became even more attractive. Cortez said this was a major reason there were no “rumbles” during her college days.

The multisectoral party scene thrived this way. Cortez found herself at one time attending three parties in one night. But it was far from the wanton and decadent party scene of the West of the sixties. The women, most of them staying in the Women’s Dorm, had to be chaperoned by the dorm matron, who would hop from one party to another to look after her wards, bringing with her the other young wards. Moreover, social graces were part of the curriculum.

In the swirl of party nights at Baker Hall, or in Copeland Heights, or the posh ACCI auditorium, non-academics exuded a special attraction.

When the parties stretched well into the night, there were no jeepneys or carretelas to ride back to the dorms. Like barriofolk, the students then traveled in groups across a landscape of rough trails, forest, hills, and fields. The ladies brought a pair of chinelas to save them the agony of making the trek on high heels. And this was why when they were later sent to remote communities for extension work, the students knew how to deal with long walks late at night.

Locals from surrounding barrios took the students’ laundry and washed it on the nearby creek using palo-palos. Davide blames the wooden mallets for his missing buttons. He says that dormers also needed mosquito nets to sleep for the whole four years in college.

There were only a few eateries near “the grove” at the Gate. And student politics during Quebral’s time was big on the alleged poor quality of food being served in the dormitories. Most dormers had to cook their own food, many learning to cook for the first time aided by their more independent mates, with produce bought from the nearest market. Cortez found this a great way to save money for her next extra-curricular activities, which on top of the socials were mostly in campus performing arts.

During Quebral’s and Davide’s time, student council elections were associated with food, not just as a subject of protest. For after the announcement of results came the tradition of “the grove march” where the winners treated colleagues to a free lunch."
Tales from UP Diliman: Fact or Fiction? – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/tales-from-up-diliman-fact-or-fiction/,"


We’ve heard these stories before and perhaps even helped spread them—while we hung out on corridors, walked along the network of pathways across UP Diliman (UPD), or ate at the various kiosks and canteens scattered around campus.

The UP seal features a parrot. The model for the Oblation is the father of a late action star. The Diliman campus is located above a fault line. The Sunken Garden and the main library are slowly sinking every year. A student will not graduate on time, if at all, if he or she has a picture taken with the Oblation.

Upperclassmen have passed on these tales to gullible, innocent freshmen. A classmate heard it from another classmate, who then told you, and you told another. You may still be a student or you may have graduated, thinking, wondering, if there is any truth to these urban legends.

Parrot on the UP seal

This is probably the first myth we hear when we enter UP and it usually provokes the question “Why would a parrot be on the UP seal?” But instead of asking why, perhaps a more important question would be: Is it really a parrot?

 

The winning seal designed by Galo B. Ocampo in 1971 was never approved for use as the official UP seal. (Photo from the UPD Archives)

 

The answer is no. It is, in fact, an eagle. Or to be specific, an American bald eagle. UP prides itself in being the national university, the hotbed of nationalist ideas. So why do we use a symbol of the United States of America on our university seal? The answer is simple: the Americans established UP. Like it or not, it’s a fact. But behind this simplistic explanation is a history of the UP seal—a seal that has been in use since the university’s early years.

The seal was approved during the 77th Board of Regents meeting on February 25, 1913. Its dimensions were re-emphasized in the Proposed Code for the University of the Philippines in 1941. On October 15, 2001, UP filed a trademark application for the UP logo with the Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines (then IP Philippines, now IPOPHL).

Its use was nearly discontinued when former UP President Salvador P. Lopez issued a memorandum circular on November 13, 1971 opening a competition for the design of a new official seal, with the winner getting a certificate of appreciation.

“The present seal dates from 1908 when the University was reorganized as an extension, and the apex, of the American educational system in the Philippines,” Lopez said. When a new seal was designed for the country in 1946, a new seal should have been designed for UP as well, he argued. That it did not happen was an oversight and should be remedied.

Lopez said, “The eagle appears to be particularly inappropriate as the dominant element in the seal of a university.” The competition closed on December 10, 1971.

The winning design was created by then National Museum Director Galo B. Ocampo, who also belonged to the UP School of Fine Arts Class of 1934. His logo featured an inverted equilateral red triangle in the middle of a green circle. The “revolutionary” triangle with the base on top, Ocampo said, focuses importance on “the masses of our people in the structure of Philippine society.”

On each corner of the triangle is a star to represent Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. Also inside the triangle is a sun that symbolizes “freedom for the individual, liberty for the nation, and independence for all.” Superimposed on the image of the sun is the Oblation, the “symbol of youth—hope of the Fatherland.” Around the green circle, where these images are emblazoned, the words “University of the Philippines” at the top and “1908” at the bottom are written in black on a background of white.

 

Ocampo’s seal was instead used in the University’s commemoration of the Philippine Centennial in 1998. (Photo by Misael A. Bacani, UP MPRO)

 

So why was this new design not adopted? During the 818th meeting of the Board of Regents on March 23, 1972, its fate was supposed to be decided under the agenda item, “Matters recommended by the president.” The Board action: “Deferment for further study on motion of Regent [Tomas Saguitan] Fonacier duly seconded.”

Twenty-six years passed before the University used Ocampo’s logo, but not as the official seal. It was used in the celebration of UP’s 90th anniversary and the Philippine Centennial in 1998. UP commemorated these historic events with the theme, “One Hundred Years of Nationalism and 90 Years of Scholarship and Service to the Nation.” A marker of the Centennial Archival Collection on the third floor of the UPD Main Library actually has Ocampo’s logo, with the white background replaced by gold.

FPJ’s father is the Oblation model

“Fernando Poe, Sr.” is one of the most common names mentioned when asking about who the Oblation was modeled after.

He was a UP student around the time the Oblation was being created by National Artist Guillermo Tolentino, then a professor at the UP School of Fine Arts. No one knows for sure how the rumor started, but speculation about his involvement in the creation of the prominent UP landmark remains to this day. Try a Google search and you will come across some websites and blogs that still state this as truth. Or you can simply ask older alumni.

 

National Artist Guillermo Tolentino (middle) with Prof. Anastacio Caedo (right) and Esteban Caedo (left). Photo is reprinted with permission from Tolentino’s daughter, Dalisay Tolentino Mendez, through her son, Manuel Mendez. It first appeared in Tolentino by Prof. Rodolfo Paras Perez.

 

Well, according to the late UP College of Fine Arts Prof. Rodolfo Paras-Perez in his book Tolentino, the Oblation was modeled after Prof. Anastacio Caedo and Virgilio Raymundo. The former was Tolentino’s student assistant then and the latter, the artist’s brother-in-law. Tolentino combined Caedo’s physique and Raymundo’s proportions, and the monument we call Oble was born. Later on, Caedo himself created the Oblation statues in UP Manila (UPM) and UP Baguio.

But that’s not all. His former student, UP Professor Emeritus Grace Javier Alfonso, confirmed that she remembers him telling her to keep in mind that he was the model for the UP Oblation. Alfonso created the Oblation monuments in UP Bonifacio Global City; UP Cebu South Road Properties; UPD Extension Program in Clark, Pampanga; UPM Philippine General Hospital compound; UPM School of Health Sciences (SHS) in Baler, Aurora; UPM SHS in Koronadal, South Cotabato; UPM SHS in Palo, Leyte; and UP Open University Headquarters. She said that when she was first asked to create an Oblation statue, she kept checking and re-checking the facial features of the Oblation during casting. “It really looks like him,” she declared.

Diliman disaster: a fault line runs through it

This has long been going around.

With talks of “The Big One” hitting Metro Manila and the recent earthquakes in the Iran-Iraq border, South Korea, Costa Rica, and New Zealand, this urban legend won’t seem to die. It is that the fault line allegedly cuts into the heart of the UPD campus, across the Academic Oval. This mysterious and fear-inducing fault, believed by many to be the West Marikina Valley Fault, is also said to be the reason the UPD Sunken Garden is, well, sunken.

Enter Prof. Alfredo Mahar Francisco A. Lagmay, a widely-consulted, often-interviewed expert from the UPD National Institute of Geological Sciences. When asked about the so-called fault line, he eagerly showed a presentation to illustrate his answer—that answer being no, there is no fault line beneath the Academic Oval, and therefore, no fault line under the Sunken Garden.

While a fault line is not along that location, Lagmay pointed out that there are faults running across the campus. Three of these were mapped in one of his presentation slides. None of them directly hit the Academic Oval. He also clarified that the West Marikina Valley Fault is actually between two and a half to three kilometers away from UPD.

But Lagmay offered a possible explanation as to how the myth started."

For UP Visayas, the celebration of its history is at the core of some of its most revered traditional events.

One of these is the week-long celebration of the Anniversary of the UP Presence in Iloilo. On December 18, 1947, responding to the desire of Ilonggos to have a UP education, the municipal board of Iloilo authorized a resolution for the opening of a branch of UP in Iloilo City on the site of what was then the Iloilo City Hall. In July 1947, the UP Iloilo College opened its doors, starting with a Lower Division for 3rd and 4th year high school students and an Upper Division for 1st and 2nd year college students. By 1954, the UP IloIlo College attained full-fledged college status and was renamed the UP College Iloilo, offering undergraduate and graduate degree programs, including a complete high school.

This year, 2017, is the 70th Anniversary of the UP Presence in Iloilo, with the celebration held on February 20 at the UP Visayas Iloilo Campus, in front of the main entrance of the historic building that nurtured the fledgling UP Iloilo College and witnessed its growth into the three-campus-strong UP Visayas of today. Also to commemorate the anniversary this year, the UP Alumni Association-Iloilo Chapter, in cooperation with the UP Silak and Silab alumni, held the biggest “Run UP” ever in August 2017—a “UP 2 UP” Marathon that ran from UP Visayas in Miagao, Iloilo, to UP Visayas’ Iloilo City campus.

There’s More Fun in UP Mindanao – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/theres-more-fun-in-up-mindanao/,"


Compared to other UP constituent universities, UP Mindanao is relatively young, but the members of the UP Mindanao Community have already created their own traditions and events that blend elements of Mindanaoan culture. Many of the traditional annual events are organized by the UP Mindanao University Student Council (USC) and student organizations, with the support of the Office of Student Affairs.

The University Convocation is organized by the administration and held at the Atrium during the first day of class, where the whole UP Mindanao community gathers to welcome freshmen, introduce the members of the administration, heads of colleges, faculty, staff and students. Student council officials are also sworn into office by the Chancellor.

Torch Night is usually held some weeks after the formal opening of classes. The upperclassmen, represented by the block leaders of the earlier freshmen batch, pass on a lit torch symbolizing responsibility and privilege as iskolar ng bayan to the current freshmen batch, represented by the freshmen block leaders of each degree program. The freshmen then pledge their oath of loyalty and responsibility to the university and their fellow students. This is accompanied by a competition of group presentations among freshmen.

Another yearly event is Freshmen Night, usually held a month after Torch Night, and which includes a dance competition and a pageant to search for the Ultimate UPMin Isko and Iska. The Freshmen Torch Night combines the symbolic passing on of degree presentation torches of Torch Night and the pageantry of Freshmen Night.

Dula, which means “play” in Cebuano, is a university-wide sportsfest usually held in the middle of the first semester, after the college-based sportsfests—Dula-dula for the College of Science and Mathematics and School of Management, and the Hampang for the College of Humanities and Social Sciences. Highlight of the sportsfest is the Cheerdance Competition, which draws attention from the media and from other universities.

Deviance Day, a celebration of UP Mindanao’s diversity of culture and ethnicity, began as a free concert hosted by the BA Social Sciences and BA Anthropology programs. Today, Deviance Day is organized by the Department of Social Sciences, CHSS, and the Dalub-aral na may Ugnayan, Galing at Organisadong Ningas na Ginagabayan ng Antropolohiya (DUGONG-ANTRO). For the entire day, participating students, faculty and staff dress up in “not-so-everyday” attire—some donning costumes representing characters from popular culture, some coming in formal attire or cross-dressing, or for the brave few, barely dressing at all. In the evening, a program featuring talent shows, presentations of best-dressed people during the day, and free concerts featuring bands in UP Mindanao would be held.

The highlight of the Christmas season in UP Mindanao is Kasadya, a Cebuano word meaning “joy” or “happiness.” The Kasadya celebration begins in December with the official lighting of the University Christmas Tree, constructed with lanterns from different student organizations. It also features the UPMin lantern parade and Pasiklaban, a skit contest for students and alumni sponsored by the UP Alumni Association-Davao.

February is an especially eventful time as UP Mindanao commemorates its foundation as a constituent university. In addition, the CHSS and CSM celebrate their foundation weeks during this month with their own events, such as the Pasundayag, an annual pageant featuring the tribes and costumes of Mindanao indigenous peoples, organized by the College of Humanities and Social Sciences Student Council.

Specific degree programs and student orgs also hold their own events, such as the BA Communication Arts program and Communicators’ Guild, and CSM Night organized by the CSM Student Council. The residents of the Elias B. Lopez Hall also celebrate their Dorm Week during February with workshops, talk shows, quiz bees, the Open House, competitions for the cleanest and best-decorated rooms, and the popular Mistress of the Dorm beauty pageant wherein cross-dressing male dormers compete for the title.

Tatak UPMin is also another gender-bending beauty pageant featuring cross-dressing male and female students from the different student orgs, as well as a Battle of the Bands. The UPMin alumni also join the festivities with their annual alumni homecoming dubbed Panagtagbo, which means “gathering” in Cebuano, and features dance concerts and musical presentations by Alagad ni Oble, one of the first musical bands established in UP Mindanao.

The UPMin alumni also hold “Bayanihan Para Kay Oble,” introduced by the UP Alumni Association Davao (UPAA Davao) as a “beautification” activity for the Oblation Plaza and as a venue for fellowship among the alumni.

In terms of arts, music and sports, the UP Mindanao Siki ni Obli student organization has been holding the Oscar Mora Cup, an annual ladies football invitational tournament, for the last 18 years. On the other hand, the UP Mindanao Dance Ensemble, the university’s resident dance company, holds its annual full-length dance-concert on the themes of “Kilos-Pinoy,” “Daloy,” “Galaw-Indak-Sayaw,” while the UP Mindanao Koro Kantahanay, the resident chorale, holds its annual concert “Overture”. Both events used to be held in February, but were moved to other months following the academic calendar shift.

“Sinews for Syllables” is an annual performance of literary works by BA English students, where the works are read in excerpt, or performed in conjunction with dance, song, and cinematic art, while “Lit-Orgy” are readings of literary works that originated with BA English students but have moved to venues outside the University.

Finally, festivities in UP Mindanao are not held by the UPMin community just for the UPMin community, but for high school students as well. A number of student organizations organize events directed toward high schools as the students’ contribution in promoting UP Mindanao to prospective students:

The Inter-High School Statistics Quiz Bowl, organized by the Society of Math Majors, is held once a semester, participated in by students from private and public schools. “Math Mania” inter-high school competition has been undertaken by Society of Math Majors annually for more than ten years.

Is this man the “Father of UP”? – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/is-this-man-the-father-of-up/,"


Most Filipinos can at least acknowledge the influence of UP as a producer of trailblazers. The University’s own institutional history has given us cursory knowledge of the great personages who were some of the “firsts”, “fathers”, or “mothers” of their colleges, areas of study, or other organizations of national importance.

For the most part, these trailblazing figures ring a bell. Many graduates, for example, recognize the American pastor Murray Bartlett to be the first President of UP, while his successor Ignacio Villamor was the first Filipino to hold the position. Similarly, Guillermo Tolentino is known as the sculptor of UP’s most iconic symbol, The Oblation (which was not, for the record, modeled on Fernando Poe, Sr.’s physique).

These and other figures are recognized for their pivotal role in UP’s history. None of them, however, is considered the “Father of UP.” The fact that the term is so rarely, if ever, used can lead one to the impression that UP is indeed a “parent-less” institution—sprouting like Athena from the nation’s cranium to guide a people beginning to find their legs.

Philippine Studies scholar and Pangasinan expert, Dr. Maria Crisanta Nelmida-Flores, however, disagrees. Her studies into the history of the nation and her home province have led her to a figure that she says might be considered worthy of the title. His name is Juan Alvear.

The University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman has a dedicated team of professionals that provides the UP Fighting Maroons—the collegiate varsity teams of UP Diliman—the health care they need, before and during University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP) tournaments.

Directly under the UP College of Human Kinetics (CHK), the UP Sports Physical Therapy Clinic (UP SPTC) is the only accredited facility that primarily provides free medical consultation, physical therapy services, first aid and paramedical assistance, and rehabilitation programs to all UP enlisted athletes. The clinic also offers local and international certification courses, trainings and seminars for physical therapy student interns and professionals in the field of sports and orthopedics. These services are also available to the University’s students, faculty, administrative personnel, and the general public.

 

Therapy in the field

According to UP SPTC Director Maria Angela L. Borras, the clinic was originally a joint project of the CHK and the then UP School of Allied Medical Professions (now College of Allied Medical Professions in UP Manila). But it was only about a decade ago when the varsity physiotherapist then for the Maroons, Anthony Caguioa, reopened the facility and accepted student interns from UP Manila to be trained in sports, says Borras.

When Borras took over the job in 2011, the UP SPTC was formally set up as an organization headed by the CHK dean. “Clinical supervisors, who are licensed PTs, were welcomed as consultants. The CHK provided an in-house physiatrist for medical consultation, and with a good number of PTs available, the clinic started to operate regularly during weekdays, from 8 am to 5 pm,” she says.

“In 2012, the clinic developed a system that partnered student interns with licensed therapists, which allowed training and game coverage for all UP Fighting Maroons varsity teams, specifically for UAAP games. Therapy sessions have been done in the field to provide return-to-sports intervention and careful monitoring of the reintegration of recovering athletes to the team and sports,” continues Borras.

According to Borras, the milestones of the clinic include “providing post-graduate seminars and certification courses for licensed PTs and other sports professionals (2014); hosting an international certification course for Kinesiology Taping and Instrument Assisted Soft-Tissue Mobilization techniques (2015); Commission on Higher Education accreditation as an internship facility (2016); graduates from UP SPTC serving as physiotherapists for both professional and non-professional athletic teams; licensed PTs who underwent post graduate training specialization working for teams here and outside the country; hosting international certification courses which cut the expenses for our local practitioners; staff serving for the Rio Summer Olympics (2016), FIFA Medical Emergency course, Anti-Doping course for healthcare professionals by Stanford University, and this year’s Russia World Cup; and, staff pursuing their master’s degree.”

 

Personnel, equipment, and other services

The UP SPTC aims to “give excellent physical therapy services for injury prevention, rehabilitation and performance enhancement of the UP Diliman Varsity Teams;” and “be a role model for all sports physical therapy clinics in the country,” among its other goals mentioned earlier. And to fulfill these aims, the clinic operates under the leadership of CHK Dean Ronualdo Dizer and in coordination with Prof. Oscar Santelices, chair of the Varsity Athletics Admission System (VAAS).

Dr. Alberto Magpily serves as the resident physiatrist. According to Borras, the resident physiatrist and visiting orthopedic doctors from the UP Philippine General Hospital are in charge of “medical consultations and referrals for ancillary procedures and physical therapy intervention or other services, as needed.”

The varsity physiotherapist, tasked with ensuring that the teams are “provided with necessary care, training, game, and clinic based rehabilitation” is Ma. Crisanta Prieto. Borras, as the director of the facility, adds that she handles “external matters involving the clinic, such as partnerships with other universities, seminars and workshops, and other non-patient related events.” Borras explains that they, together with other physical therapists, serve as consultants, and as clinical and field supervisors who guide and assess students’ performance during their affiliation period.

Borras says that the clinic, located at the Ylanan Gymnasium of the CHK, makes use of equipment such as “therapeutic modalities like ultrasound and TENS, a traction machine, a LASER machine, and exercise machines for strengthening and endurance.” She adds that “the clinic also offers specialized services like instrument assisted soft tissue mobilization, stationary and gliding cups, kinesiology taping, and wellness programs for weight loss or competition preparation for recreational athletes.”

 

The clinic’s UP spirit

With only one physiotherapist in charge of all the members of the varsity teams of UP Diliman, of each and every athlete of the UP Fighting Maroons, and clinic personnel having no security of tenure as consultants under non-UP contracts that are renewed every six months, the UP SPTC harnesses the UP spirit of honor and excellence, and dedication and grit, to provide its services, fulfill its goals, and thrive.

His music is ubiquitous. From pop hits that serve as the theme songs of many a love story to the soundtracks of commercial and indie films; from massive works of musical theatre, neo-opera, and sacred music to commercial jingles and opening themes to TV specials—there isn’t a Filipino alive who hasn’t heard, thrilled to, or jammed along with his music.

He has helped shape the Philippine music industry today, crossing the line between “serious” and pop music with ease, and mentoring some of the country’s most gifted musicians. He is known as The Maestro, or simply as Mr. C. This October, UP College of Music alumnus and former professor Raymundo Cipriano “Ryan” Pujante Cayabyab received another title, that of National Artist.

One morning before his newest award of recognition, Mr. C sat down for an interview with UP Forum, during which he shared some of his memories of UP; his views on UP’s impact on Philippine music; and a bit of inspiration for anyone seeking their path in life.

 

What was your childhood in UP like?

When my mother was teaching [at the UP College of Music], we lived inside UP. I grew up inside the UP Campus, in Area 1, went to UP Elementary School and UP High School, graduating in 1970. My first course was Business Administration, then I went to the UP College of Music, and I graduated around 10 years after I got into the UP College of Music.

Noong bata kami, lumalabas kami ng bahay sa December or January, at kapag nagsasalita kami, may usok yung bibig namin. Ganon kaginaw. Nagtatawanan na kami. “Oy, para tayong nagsi-sigarilyo.”

Iba naman yung usok na nalalanghap namin kapag may umiikot na DDT truck. Siguro every week or every two weeks, umiikot ang DDT truck na bumubuga ng DDT. Lahat ng bata sa campus, nandoon, lalabas na, hahabulin yung truck. Sobrang kapal ng smoke na binubuga, para kaming nasa alapaap. Ang feeling namin, kaya kami lahat may topak dahil doon, eh. [laughs]

 

What do you think makes you unique among the musicians in the country?

Lagi kong sinasabi, maraming mas magaling sa aking gumawa ng kanta sa Philippine music industry. Ang dami diyang mas magaling gumawa ng hit songs. The only reason napapahiwalay ako sa kanila is, ako lang ang merong diploma. Ako lang ang merong degree na binigay ng isang unibersidad. That’s it. Pero for me, it’s a big deal. Not because of the degree, but because of what I learned in the College of Music through the years.

 

 

What has been the impact of your UP education on you? How has UP contributed to Philippine
music as a whole?

My first teacher was Eliseo Pajaro, in Composition. My second teacher was Lucio San Pedro, National Artist. My third teacher was Ramon Santos, National Artist. My fourth teacher was Francisco Feliciano, National Artist. I’ve been influenced by all of them. Not that I have discarded their ideas; their ideas remain. I picked up a lot of things from my teachers, but do I sound like any of them? Not really. I sound like me. But that’s also exactly what they taught us.

UP’s contribution is huge. The UP College of Music is known for compositional theory and research. Composition also means the training of new music composers. Ang dami nila; even in the choral world, the names that come out are from UP. So sa larangan ng music composition, malaki ang contribution ng UP. And then research. Wow, ang research ng UPCM, beginning with the huge work of Dr. Jose Maceda, National Artist."

I call it ‘non-music’ because it doesn’t fit the idea of what music is,” says National Artist for Music, composer, ethnomusicologist, and UP Professor Emeritus Ramon Pagayon Santos.

“It” is his area of research: non-Western indigenous expressive traditions that are part of the genre called “ethnic music.” Because “music,” he explains, is a Western concept defined by elements such as structure, counterpoint, harmony, texture, and form, among others, “it is not really music—not in the strictest sense.”

New UP Cebu Oblation with former UP President Alfredo Pascual and university officials

 

May 3, 2018 was the culmination of UP Cebu’s centennial celebrations, which carried the theme “Unang Siglo: Halad sa Katawhan, of Academic Excellence and Public Service”. The day saw the unveiling of a “gratitude wall” for UP Cebu donors, the inauguration of the UP Presidents’ markers at the new Oblation Square, awarding ceremonies for constituents, and a grand centennial “cookout” out in the open.

UP Cebu unveiled the stone markers for all UP Presidents with former UP Presidents or their representatives attending. They were Presidents Alfredo Pascual, Francisco Nemenzo, and Engr. Jose Paolo Soriano for his father Emmanuel Soriano. Presidents Edgardo Angara and Emil Javier sent messages. Performances making use of multimedia and dinner in the Performing Arts Auditorium and Lobby, and the awarding of the Centennial Gawad Chancellor to outstanding constituents also marked the event.

Earlier in the day, UP Cebu Chancellor Liza Corro unveiled the Gratitude Wall in the Administration Building, with UP Law Class ’86–the first to respond to the centennial fund-raising with a P1-million donation–assisting the chancellor. The program had Grace Javier Alfonso delivering an artist talk on her design of the newly installed Guillermo Tolentino’s Oblation. Likewise installed was a small amphitheater to replace the old plaza in front of the Administration Building.

The day ended with a grand centennial cookout out in the open, where UP Cebu officials and constituents enjoyed a picnic, concerts, fireworks, and an Oblation Run with their guests.

Faculty Regent Patricia Arinto, Regent Frederick Mikhail Farolan, Vice President for Administration Nestor Yunque, Vice President for Public Affairs Jose Dalisay Jr., UP Open University (UPOU) Chancellor Melinda Bandalaria, former UPOU Chancellor Grace Javier Alfonso, UP Los Baños Chancellor Fernando Sanchez, and former Assistant Vice President for Development Jaime Caro attended the day’s celebrations; as did Cebu Gov. Hilario Davide III and his wife Jobelle, Mandaue City Vice Mayor Carlo Fortuna, and Cebu City Councilor Margot Osmeña. They were joined by officers and members of the UP Cebu Alumni Association led by Atty. Ria Espina, and the UP College of Law Batch ’86.

Start-up carves a niche in human resource solutions – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/start-up-carves-a-niche-in-human-resource-solutions/,"Start-up carves a niche in human resource solutions
September 26, 2018 | Written by Jo. Florendo B. Lontoc



There’s always a great value added to customized products and services. “Customized” sounds good to the buyer—but not so if it costs an arm and a leg. Or the client can choose from ready-made boxes most suitable for his or her needs, which is convenient for the provider as well, but often results in pain when the box inevitably doesn’t quite fit. Or the two parties can listen to each other in crafting a product or service that could more fully satisfy both.

The makers of Payruler, “a fully customized as well as a comprehensive set of human resources (HR) software,” have sorted out this potential mess. Sounding like “payroll” as a marketing peg, “Payruler tailor-fits HR process automation for Philippine businesses,” says Jojo de Jesus. Together with his daughter, a young Computer Science graduate of UP Cebu, de Jesus heads Genii Hut Technologies, a start-up scaling up from incubation at the UP Cebu Business Incubator for Information Technology (UPCeBuInIT).

 

‘We got you covered,’ Payruler posters say, ‘from applicant pooling, 360 performance evaluation, automated government-mandated forms, to last pay computation.’

 

Genii Hut, with Payruler as its banner product, set out to create technologies that would fit clients’ process automation needs, sparing the clients from making major process adjustments just so they could make use of limited automation technologies pervasive in the market.

“We build software that is not boxed, that the client has to fit in the box. We actually fit the box to the client,” De Jesus reiterates. “Whenever we have a demo, we ask, what’s your pain point right now?” Then they make necessary tweaks. “For our competitors, oh, that’s already a big deal,” De Jesus observes. “We capture that peculiarity of the business process that the clients want to automate. That has become second nature to us.”

Payruler has customizable modules for recruitment and human resources information, which includes assessment for regularization, and asset and training tracking. Its timekeeping allows for multiple job shifts and tracking of overtimes and leaves. Its payroll technology automates benefits and deductions. A module for reporting makes the information ready any time. A mobile app for IOS and Android allows employers to keep track of employees, approve leaves, and sign off on business matters while on the go. Through an Employee Self Service mobile app, employees can also time in during field work, check their payslips, leaves, loans, and others.

“We sell, rent, and do the system. We sell it to big companies for them to use it themselves. For MSMEs, which can’t buy a million- or two million-peso system, they just rent monthly. For those really small, such as those with five to 10 employees, we actually do the payroll for them. They just send the time sheets to us. We do everything including reporting,” De Jesus said.

Payruler, the upstart-startup from UP Cebu, has been challenging established brands such as Oracle, SAP, Quickbooks, Sprout, Magellan, Titanium and a lot of big names in Manila and began making a dent in this market immediately after launching. Case in point: the Philippine Stock Exchange, which acquired Payruler in 2015, after a tedious selection process.

The company was established in 2014 with five people. It moved in to UP CeBuInIT a year after, where they hired two more and had their first three clients, including PSE. They initially had a cubicle and ended up using the whole room.

By word of mouth of its customized solutions, Payruler’s users have grown to around 51 since, including, to mention a few, Sky Logistics Group, a ground handler for airlines; Negros Navigation-ATS; Executive Boutique, a call center; and, TBWA, a global advertising company.

Chancellor Liza Corro expresses confidence in the batch’s eagerness to “pay it forward,” ahead of any return service requirement.

Former Senate President and property magnate Manuel Villar Jr., commencement speaker, argues the case for entrepreneurship, which he says should be tried at least once, is an art form, and is key to attaining dignity for the self and for the country.

Pusô and UP Cebu – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/puso-and-up-cebu/,"


The short video makes its metaphor clear: Education is like pusô, an iconic Cebuano street food consisting of rice boiled in packets of woven coconut leaves. In the video, the values of hard work, perseverance, strength, faith and experience helps a young man earn his degree from UP Cebu, while his mother provides him support and pusô.

Titled “Puso 2 – University of the Philippines Cebu”, the video is itself a symbol of the spirit of UP Cebu—steeped in the culture of the region, full of UP Cebu’s heart and sense of community, and showing a mastery of both technology and art.

The video won the Most Creative Corporate Institution Video Award – Gold Prize during the 5th QS-Maple Professional Leaders in Education Conference and Exhibit in Doha, Qatar in May 2015. The win “puts UP Cebu on the map of academic institutions that lead in creative and persuasive visual communication,” says Prof. Gregg Lloren, the video’s creative director and assistant professor at the UP Cebu Arts and Humanities cluster (now the College of Communication, Art, and Design). Then UP Cebu Dean and now Chancellor Liza Corro was executive producer.

The school that lived

UP Cebu is no stranger to change or to struggle. In fact, in a PowerPoint presentation based on an article on UP Cebu’s history, author and UP Cebu history professor Dr. Madrileña de la Cerna includes a photo of Cebu College taken around the late ‘40s with the caption “The School that Refused to Die.” When it comes to perseverance, resilience and sheer tenacity, UP Cebu knows what’s up.

 

An old photo of Cebu College, UP, taken from Dr. de la Cerna’s presentation.

 

The Junior College of Liberal Arts in Cebu City was established on May 3, 1918, with classes at Warwick Barracks in front of Leon Kilat Street in Ermita District, near where Carbon market is now. The fledgling college soon faced challenges such as the lack of a permanent home, the effects of a global economic crisis, and opposition in Manila against the further expansion and continued existence of the college. But the will of the Cebuano people and the UP Cebu community prevailed, and the Junior College of Liberal Arts in Cebu City was granted a 13-hectare site in Lahug plus yearly funds by the Cebu Provincial Board.

In 1927, Prof. Teofilo Reyes of the UP College of Engineering finalized plans for the Lahug campus and oversaw the completion of a two-story building, which was inaugurated by UP President Rafael Palma in 1929. In 1936, the Junior College became a permanent branch of UP through Act No. 4244, enabling it to expand its role in the province by offering more courses leading to degrees in Commerce, Education, General Preparatory Law and Preparatory Medicine.

When war broke out, the College was forced to close on December 13, 1941. Its main building was used as an internment camp for American and British civilians and later as a stockade for condemned prisoners by Japanese forces.

In 1945, the campus was returned to UP, and classes were held at the buildings the Americans had built. The main building and athletic field, which were damaged during the war, were repaired through funds from the War Damage Commission.

A few years later, in 1950, the College was closed again when UP students protesting the actions of powerful Cebuano politicians and their armed goons during the presidential elections angered a Cebuano Senate President. As Dr. De la Cerna wrote: “Only the students of UP Cebu dared to lampoon these politicians in the editorial cartoons of their campus paper, The Junior Collegian, getting the ire of the powerful political lords of Cebu.”

After UP alumni campaigned for it, the College was reopened in 1963. The next decades saw turmoil within the College, followed by changes in 1986-1987 that placed UP Cebu under the UP in the Visayas. In 1990-1991, the entire collegial organization was restructured, with academic programs clustered into five disciplines, namely Management, Humanities, Natural Sciences and Mathematics, Social Sciences, and the High School. In 2010, the UP Cebu College was granted autonomy by the BOR. Then in 2011, UP Cebu grew again as construction began for its new campus in a five-hectare lot of Cebu City’s South Road Properties, which is now home to the UP Professional Schools, offering degree programs such as Master of Business Administration, Master of Science in Computer Science, Master of Education and Master of Science in Environmental Studies. Finally, on the 27th of October 2016, the UP Cebu was elevated as the 8th constituent university with the installation of the former Dean to Chancellor, Atty. Liza D. Corro.

Not bad for a tiny junior college that started out with 28 students and two faculty members.

Cookouts and Cosplay in UP Cebu – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/cookouts-and-cosplay-in-up-cebu/,"

Jive Monterozo, UPC-USC Chairperson, takes the lead for the UP Cebu University Student Council’s segment as they raise the call for this year’s UP Cookout. (Photos from the UP Cookout Facebook page, https://www.facebook.com/UPCebuCookout/)

 

Many traditions across the UP constituent universities started out as a form of protest, and the UP Cebu Cookout is one such tradition. In 1987, the students of the then UP Cebu College gathered together on the campus grounds to protest against a repressive dean, and they literally cooked food as they discussed the issues that affected the university and the country.

The UP Cebu Cookout became a popular yearly activity produced by the BA Mass Communication students, with the University Student Council as executive producer. The cookout, which begins in the evening and ends at 6:00 a.m. the next day, serves to showcase the talents of UP students and Cebu-based bands and performers through four segments—dance (sayawan), song (kantahan), band performances (bandahan), and creative modeling (rampahan), as well as other art forms.

 

The #UPCookout2017 crowd last November 10–over 3,700 strong

 

More importantly, the UP Cebu Cookout serves to highlight specific issues affecting the university and the country. In 2014, for example, the issue was UP’s academic calendar shift; in 2015, the national elections; and in 2016, it was responsible social media usage. In 2017, the UP Cookout, held last November 10 at the UP Cebu grounds, carried the theme “Guns N Roses: Will you pull the trigger?” as it tackled the spreading violence in Philippine society.

The Cookout is not the only highly popular and much-anticipated event in UP Cebu. The UP Otakufest has become Cebu’s largest cosplay and hobbies convention, where fans of all hobbies, sci-fi and fantasy shows, cartoons, books, movies, games and so on—but mainly Japanese manga and anime—gather together to show their love for their fandoms, showcase their talents, and hobnob with fellow fans."

Feeling like an underdog is not unusual. A lot of people must have probably felt neglected some time in their lives—that feeling when people underestimate you and they don’t see your true potential and think you are not valuable.

Yet, the process of proving them wrong is the sweetest victory that the underdogs can ever experience—enough to start a party by the bonfire.

This kind of grit is what property developer 8990 Holdings and the University of the Philippines men’s basketball team (UP Fighting Maroons) have in common. Being underdogs in their respective fields—the latter in collegiate basketball and the former in the housing industry—brought them together in this unique partnership.

Last June 24, 8990 Holdings president and chief executive Januario Jesus Gregorio “JJ” Atencio III signed a memorandum of agreement (MOA) with UP to sponsor the training of the men’s basketball team in Las Vegas in time for the upcoming University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP) Season 80.

Interestingly enough, Atencio —a true-blue Atenista, but undeniably has a heart for the Maroons—agreed to sponsor the team’s training in one of the best training camps in the world. Although unwilling to disclose the specific amount, he humbly said it would cost him a few million pesos.

This is the training camp where NBA and NCAA teams in the US practice and where national teams would want to set foot in.

“This is going to be our first time to get them to go there,” Maroons coach Dolreich “Bo” Perasol said in an interview.

The underdogs

The training camp will be a big help for the Fighting Maroons—always the bottom dwellers in recent years. Last season, their five wins astounded many fans and alumni. From being at the bottom of the rank, the team was two wins away from making it to the final four.

8990 Holdings, on the other hand, is still considered an underdog in the housing industry in spite of its success. This is despite having been listed on the Philippine Stock Exchange in the past seven years.

8990 Holdings is currently valued by the stock market at around P35 billion. This is just a drop in the bucket compared to property blue chips like Ayala Land, which has a market capitalization of around P595 billion, or SM Prime Holdings, which is now valued by the market at close to P1 trillion. 8990 Holdings is also valued at less than half of how much Vista Land is trading for (P77 billion) or less than a third of Megaworld Corp.’s valuation of P145 billion.

“Early on, we realized that success is not just a result, it’s a process. And so you got to enjoy the process of becoming champions in the same way that we are in the process of becoming champions in the industry where we are in,” Atencio told the team.

(Photo from Inquirer.net)
Not smart enough for UP?

“My parents are not from UP. My grandparents are not from UP … My mother told me, ‘You know what J? You’re not too smart to study there,’” Atencio recalled.

But he can always say he has that UP connection, having taken swimming classes there when he was nine years old.

Atencio said he found out about the financial need of the Fighting Maroons from his friends, Renen Dalisay of nowheretogobutUP Foundation and veteran fund manager and entrepreneur Kevin Khoe.

“One of the things that interests me with this sponsorship is this: You are the only team in the UAAP and in the NCAA that carries the name, not only just of the school, but also of the country,” Atencio told the UP team.

Deca Homes, 8990 Holdings’ banner project offering affordable housing, was similar to the UP community, Atencio said. It’s a community where people from all walks of life are present, he said.

Atencio said the basketball team’s potential, commitment and attitude were the reasons why he would root for them."

Saving Pieces of UP History – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/saving-pieces-of-up-history/,"


Old, dark, and musty.

These characteristics come to mind when we think of archives. And the impression we have of the UP Diliman University Archives is no different. Who would even want to go there when going online would be much more convenient?

But tucked away in boxes, filed in folders and envelopes, are treasures that line rows upon rows of shelves at the top levels of Gonzalez Hall, the UPD Main Library. The Archives do not only contain printed matter, but memorabilia as well. There are things you won’t ever find online and for serious researchers, history buffs, or the just plain curious, archival materials are like manna from heaven.

Tangible memories, priceless value

The University Archives protect permanent University records, theses, dissertations, procedural documents, scholarly works, personal papers, UP publications, photographs, and items from UP personalities like medals, trophies, togas, artworks, and even furniture.

“I can’t put a monetary value on what we have here,” said University Archives Head Librarian Eimee Lagrama. “We’re talking about institutional memory and it’s not something we can simply put a price tag on.”

Materials at the Archives are tangible records of memory, documenting the history of a University community, recording UP’s development not just as an institution but capturing the intellectual ferment UP is known for.

For those who want to know if there are confidential materials, the answer is yes. And if you happen to be faced with such, the best course of action would be to consult the University’s legal office.

Ideal vs. real

Keeping priceless materials requires a lot of care in their preservation, maintenance, and management. In an ideal situation, Lagrama said that archives should be temperature-controlled, humidity-controlled, and secured in a structure that can withstand natural and man-made disasters. In addition, archivists should be armed with conservation skills and have “intellectual control over the collection,” which means knowing each material “down to the last item.”

She cited the British Library and the Getty Research Institute as having some of the best archives in the world. “They’re well-funded.” Locally, Lagrama said Ateneo de Manila University and De La Salle University are doing a good job of maintaining their archives because of the resources that are being poured into their upkeep.

A visit to the UPD University Archives will show that its conditions are far from ideal—tarpaulins covering shelves to shield them from leaking ceilings, cramped spaces, no protection from dust, and no humidity or temperature control—but its people clearly do the best they can.

“We just do passive preservation, so we try to keep the materials in a stable condition. Changes in temperature and humidity are bad for paper, which means it’s better to have no airconditioning at all than to have it turned on during office hours and turned off at the end of the workday.”

UP Diliman launched the first Science, Technology, and Society (STS) Month with the theme, “Bodies, Science, and Philippine Society”, on October 4, 2018 at the Palma Hall Lobby.

According to the organizer, the UP Diliman Office for Initiatives in Culture and the Arts (UPD-OICA), the theme arose from UP Diliman’s Festival of Culture and the Arts last February, where the body was identified as an important device in knowledge production. “This time, the Philippine body is explored as a scientific concept grounded in a socio-historical milieu,” OICA said.

Science, Technology and Society (STS) is a course in the University that explores how the sciences and society interact.

According to Prof. Giovanni Tapang of the National Institute of Physics, who was the master of ceremonies of the opening program, the STS Month would celebrate the oneness of the natural and social sciences and the arts, as represented by UP Diliman’s former College of Arts and Sciences, which broke up to form three colleges 35 years ago. These are the College of Science, the College of Social Sciences and Philosophy, and the College of Arts and Letters.

For an old campus such as UP Los Baños, established in 1909, an iconic tree could simply be any one of those trees that have survived the years since.

Even at its busy academic center, it is not lacking in trees that have been there since any one could remember: the “Fertility Tree” standing like a mother among its brood of acacias at the Freedom Park; or the royal palm trees that still tower over the street from the Carabao Park to Palma Bridge; or the pili trees after which the tree-lined avenue was named; or even perhaps the dao tree before the Student Union building.

Likewise, UP Visayas, having a pre-war building which used to be a city hall until it was converted for use by the university, could choose among those that have survived the transition.

UP Baguio is perhaps defined by what defines the city in general, the Benguet pine.

For other, perhaps newer, campuses, the choice could be more aspirational; that is, a tree to represent their future.

We could ask the campus chancellors to name the iconic trees of their campus, given these options. But the choice is not really as simple.

UP campuses are known tree havens. The system-wide master development plan has special provisions for trees and which trees. Going by the term, iconic trees could be as numerous as the different experiences or associations of constituents with trees on campus. And that entails a survey of all UP constituents who have ever lived.

We ended up asking for that tree which simply stood out in individual memory.

A tree of inspiration

“At the top of my head, it is the ubiquitous tambis fruit trees that I would like to honor in our campus with distinction,” writes Chancellor Liza Corro of UP Cebu.

There are two planted on both sides of the UP Cebu administration building. One is right outside the chancellor’s front window.

“These trees had been immortalized already in a lot of paintings and photographs,” she says. “Likewise, a poem had been written about the tambis trees and their fruits by a member of Tinta, a UP Cebu organization which is into writing poems and poem readings. This poem was read in one of UP Cebu’s celebrations of the Buwan ng Wika, which the administrative staff enjoyed and was really able to relate to.”

According to Corro, “When in season, the tambis fruits are scattered in front of the building, and the ground is colored with red fruits splattered on the grounds. Janitors patiently sweep the ground to clean up these fruits, which otherwise would be a feast for the ants and the birds.”

“Currently, on the right side of the Admin building is the billboard with the tarp bearing UP Cebu’s tagline: ‘Nurtured to Create, Inspired to Innovate and Destined to Serve.’ It had to be moved a little bit to ensure that the tambis trees are not covered.”

Corro realizes that the tambis trees and their fruits reflect the tagline. “Maintenance people nurture these trees, in the same manner they nurture UP Cebu’s staff who enjoy the juicy fruits when they are in season, some of whom would dare climb up the trees to gather the red juicy, scratch-free fruits.”

Established in 1918, UP Cebu stands alongside UPLB as one of UP’s oldest campuses. “UP Cebu’s tambis trees had long been witnesses to the unwavering service and protest rallies of UP Cebu constituents happening in the Oblation park,” Corro, the campus’s first chancellor, says.

A tree for preservation

Chancellor Carmencita Padilla of UP Manila, UP’s birthplace, chose a tree unknown to many UP Manila constituents although it has been there from the beginning.

The tree had not been in plain sight. “The hundred-year-old dita tree stood between two old buildings: the Science Centrum and the Sports and Wellness Center, both now demolished, behind the two-storey 100-year-old National Institutes of Health (NIH) building,” she says.

“It became the center of attraction when we started planning for the new NIH building.” At an estimated P1 billion, the new NIH building is one of UP’s biggest infrastructure projects. “The tree stood in the middle of the 4,000-square meter lot assigned to the building. The first thought was to cut it because we were informed that it would be costly to preserve the tree in the background of a building around it. But to our surprise, it was declared a Heritage Tree one year before we started working on the design,” she explains.

“Other thoughts entered our mind. Maybe it was a sick tree and needed to be cut. UP Los Baños Forestry retired professor Jose Sargento, a silviculturist, was consulted and he told us that it was a healthy tree and was good for another four decades with proper care and attention.’”

According to studies, the roots and branches need at least 20 meters around it to breathe. For the tree to survive the construction, technical and scientific expertise had to be provided to the design contractor.

“The thought of the life and death of a tree became a discussion point with the architects,” Padilla adds. “After several meetings, we included in our terms of reference for bidders for this NIH building the item that the dita tree was part of the design package and that the contractor would be fined if the tree dies. The approved design has the dita tree fronting the lobby of the 18-story building, expected to be completed by the end of 2019.”

Padilla hopes the tree will be an icon for urban ecology, “where nature and humanity are harmonized.”

Trees for the senses

“My favorite trees before I became chancellor was a kapok tree in one corner of the AS Parking lot, and a row of fire trees on the street next to it,” UP Diliman Chancellor Michael Tan says.

“As the summer set in around April, the kapok tree would bloom, its pods releasing cotton-like balls that look almost like snow when they fall to the ground. When the fire trees bloomed, it was a sight to behold as well, the street turning crimson. Together, the kapok and fire trees signaled, in the past, the end of the school year. In the new academic calendar, it remains a marker of the end of the second semester.”

He adds that there was “Just one drawback with the kapok: I suspect I share with others an allergy to the kapok, so it is indeed a sight to behold…and to sneeze at.”

Tan, whose previous columns on a national daily show his interest in trees, took the time to check if another tree he loved still existed:

“I actually was able to confirm the other tree that I loved. It’s kalingag or cinnamon, scientific name Cinnamomum mercadoi. It’s on the hill near the pond in front of AS 101. If you rub the leaves hard, or scratch the bark you’ll catch a faint whiff of cinnamon.

What’s Cooking on Campus – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/whats-cooking-on-campus/,"


On very rare occasions, the biggest challenge in the day of the average isko and iska is looking for a place to eat. This isn’t for a lack of choices within and off-campus, but because there’s too many—actually a surplus of food joints serving everything from snacks you can munch on in an Ikot jeep while running between classes, to more laidback and comfortable nooks where you can have a food trip with your GE classmates.

Apart from the noteworthy tapsilog in Rodic’s, or The Chocolate Kiss Café’s more posh offerings, there are a number of food hubs emerging from around the UP community. In case you’re looking for a new favorite spot, here are some.

Tinapay

Tinapay is run by Kuya Onz, a resident of San Antonio Street, Pook Dagohoy in UP Diliman. He opened the store in mid-2000 but closed it briefly recently and was missed terribly by its patrons, mostly dormers looking for a quick bite late at night. Customers will be greeted by funny signs flanking its simple menu of footlong sandwiches, aptly named “footlong” for one long sausage, “feetlong” for two, and “footres” for three sausages in one footlong bun. They also serve burgers but what makes these sandwiches truly unique are the generous toppings of egg, ham, cheese, and multi-colored sauces ranging from green, blue, and yellow—something that will pop out of your Instagram feed. The store is open from 6:00PM to 1:00AM but they are closed on weekends.

Buen Comer

For the more adventurous, a short tricycle ride from the campus will lead you to Buen Comer, a hole-in-the-wall joint which offers Filipino-Mexican fusion meals. The quaint, unassuming store opened its doors last year with a small metal van reminiscent of food trucks, and basic stools and tables inside. Its tasty dishes soon caught up through word of mouth and the store has now gotten itself a cult following from foodies in the Maginhawa area. This is no simple feat, as the Maginhawa-Malingap-Matalino quadrant is continuously sprouting food parks and shops catering to a vast array of culinary cravings. Buen Comer’s bestseller is its kare-kare burrito which, as the name suggests, is kare-kare rice with beef chunks wrapped in pita. You should also try nacho potato crisps, peri-peri chicken, steak and fries burrito and their limited edition pares burrito.

The Manininda

Of course, when you don’t have a lot of time and money, the landmark kiosks of the Samahan ng mga Manininda are your best friend. The unmistakable green iron booths bear the standard feast of fishballs, squid balls, kwek-kwek, pancit canton, and sandwiches. You may order separately or through their “combos” which usually include a meal and drinks. These kiosks are found all around campus but people frequent the ones near the College of Architecture, the College of Arts and Letters, Vinzons Hall, and the College of Human Kinetics.

Tomatokick

Oldtimers in UP always tell the younger students that the go-to drinking place is Sarah’s along C.P. Garcia Avenue. However, over the past decade, another watering hole has gained popularity among members of the UP community—students and professors alike. Previously located along Maginhawa Street (the old spot became campaign headquarters for a losing vice-presidential candidate), Tomatokick is now located on Malingap Street in UP Village. With its typical but tasty renditions of the usual pulutan paired with local beers and spirits, the restobar has also been a spot for cultural performances (Parokya ni Edgar even had a spontaneous gig last March), poetry reading and book launches, and even charitable fundraisers for conflict-ridden areas in the country. Tomatokick is now a hub not just for merrymaking but for meaningful endeavors as well.

"Time, Space and UP Manila – University of the Philippines",https://up.edu.ph/time-space-and-up-manila/,"


In some places, relics of the past are often relegated to certain sites and visited from time to time. But for UP Manila, history and heritage are literally carved into the walls of its campus, which stands unique among UP’s 17 existing campuses in the way it blends past and present, academic excellence and public service, in one dynamic, seamless whole.

As Dr. Arlene A. Samaniego, UP Manila Vice-Chancellor for Administration, puts it, “The architectural and landscape designs of most heritage buildings of UP Manila indeed reflect distinct periods in the history of the University and of the City of Manila. As the original birthplace and cradle of UP, the Padre Faura campus is home to heritage buildings and artifacts that date back to the early 1900s and were witnesses to its early struggles and formative years.”

Quoting the coffee-table book U.P. Manila: 100 Years of Heritage, Culture and Arts (2009): “The physical evolution of the original campus of the State University is a story that has two major layers—that of the new civic architecture introduced by Americans but eventually designed and built wholly by Filipinos, and that of education as a tool for economic and political growth. Both layers meld together to create what was and still is a key district of central Manila.”

A living history

Many of the buildings in UP Manila are the products of the first generation of modern Filipino architects who were trained in the US. The first buildings were designed by William Parsons in 1908. He completed the planning of the campus and melded it with the original Burnham master plan for Manila in 1905. Parsons also designed the buildings of the College of Medicine, the University Hall (now the Supreme Court), and the Philippine General Hospital (PGH).

Students, faculty, staff, and patients walk daily through heritage buildings such as Rizal Hall; the College of Medicine; the PGH with its two heritage structures, the Cancer Institute and Nurses Home; the College of Public Health; the National Institutes of Health; and the Museum of a History of Ideas (formerly the old Infirmary and later occupied by the College of Dentistry, which moved to its own building in 2002).

The heritage buildings are not the only treasures within the campus. There are works of art scattered about, such as the concrete replica of Dr. Jose Rizal’s Triumph of Science Over Death, known colloquially as Triumph or Lady Med; the sculpture titled “Celebration of Life” by National Artist Napoleon Abueva; the murals of National Artist Carlos “Botong” Francisco in the PGH lobby, depicting the history of Philippine medicine; the mural titled History of Medicine by Jose Blanco at the PGH Lobby, created to commemorate the PGH’s 100th anniversary; and the mural at the NIH lobby by Salvador Juban of Angono, Rizal, portraying UP Manila scientists/researchers who have contributed to the advancement of Philippine medicine.

But by far the heart and soul of UP Manila, occupying 10 of the campus’ 14 hectares, is the PGH itself. As the country’s biggest modern tertiary hospital, the PGH serves more than half a million patients a year and trains thousands of health students and workers. The hospital is also a distinct landmark in the City of Manila, standing out with its classical and neo-classical design, history, and significance.

In commemoration of the 158th birth anniversary of Dr. Jose P. Rizal, the country’s national hero, the University of the Philippines Center for Integrative and Development Studies (UP CIDS) Program on Alternative Development (AltDev) hosted a forum, “Rethinking Rizal for the 21st Century: Unexplored Themes and New Interpretations,” on June 19 at the UP CIDS Conference Hall, Ang Bahay ng Alumni, UP Diliman, Quezon City. Professors George Aseniero, PhD, Floro C. Quibuyen, PhD, and Lisandro E. Claudio, PhD, served as resource speakers.

In his welcome remarks, UP Executive Vice President Teodoro J. Herbosa emphasized the importance of studying Rizal and Philippine history. He said that Rizal’s views “had and continue to have profound influence on the Philippines’ and other Asian people’s national liberation movements and development paradigms.” He added that he will keep on supporting these initiatives for “scholarly research, commentaries, and dissemination, for more Filipinos, especially our younger generations of students,” to benefit from.

“Rizal on Imperialism”

Aseniero, whose grandfather was among Rizal’s students, presented his lecture, “The Game of the Great Powers: Rizal on Imperialism.”

Aseniero talked of how Rizal probably analyzed the geopolitical situation during the upsurge of both reformist and revolutionary movements for Philippine independence. Referring to today’s “inter-imperialist rivalry”, he said Rizal saw several nations being “engaged in the ‘Game of the Great Powers’” and that Rizal also wrote of the possibility of“la gran Republica Americana” joining the rivalry of powers with intentions of colonizing the Philippines.He addedthat Rizal’s forecasts for the next one hundred years, as written by Rizal in Filipinas dentro de cienanos (The Philippines a century hence) and published in the La Solidaridad,came true within just a decade.

Using Kondratiev wave theory, or long waves to illustrate patterns of growth and decline of the world economy, Aseniero described the world economy to be growing fast as a basis for the emergence of the Philippine middle class when Rizal was born. As the world economy was going down in the 1880s, he said the economic crisis led to political developments, and tensions between world powers also became evident.

According to Aseniero, Rizal eventually concluded that the US had “geostrategic interests in the Pacific.”Aseniero related US policies with prevailing conditions, as of the 1890s, citing US government’s declaration of “overpopulation” and US interests in the Pacific as their motives for developing naval superiority in a very short period of time.

Aseniero explained how Rizal saw the world being divided among the rivals, based on Rizal’s comments on the British empire, France, Germany, Holland, China, Japan, and the US, in relation to the balance of power.Insights gleaned from one of Rizal’s unfinished drafts, “La politica intercontinental,” revealed that the US was seen as a rival ofEngland; and,he noted how the developments in the 1890s indicated the rise of the US as a new hegemonic power. By this time, Aseniero said, Rizal was concerned with an inter-imperialist war, and “this explains his negative position on the Katipunan’s plan to revolt and the subsequent statements he made at his trial. It also frames his conceptualization of La Liga Filipina as a national federation of mutualist associations for the construction of Civil Society irrespective of the State,”Aseniero explained.

“Revisiting Rizal’s Forgotten Borrador”

Quibuyen’s presentation, “The Future has an Ancient Heart: Revisiting Rizal’s Forgotten Borrador – Melanesia, Malasia, Polinesia,”focused on explaining the origins of Rizal’s vision of Filipinos discovering their “good old qualities…free, lovers of peace, jovial, cheerful, smiling, hospitable, and fearless.”

Quibuyen said that “Rizal’s forgotten notes, ‘Melanesia, Malasia, Polinesia,’” points to Filipinos’ pre-Sanskrit roots as a basis for this vision. According to Quibuyen, “Some 3,500 years ago, our seafaring ancestors sailed over 2,000 kilometers of the Pacific Ocean and settled a group of islands that Spanish colonizers later named Las Islas Marianas and its inhabitants, Chamorros. Through our ancestors, the Chamorros, we can imagine what we were like thousands of years before the arrival on our shores of Sanskrit and Chinese and Muslim traders—indeed long before the Spanish conquistadores and missionaries.”

In his presentation, Quibuyen also mentioned that “seafarers from the Philippines were the first in the history of mankind,” and that “this (today’s Philippines) is not the nation Rizal envisioned.”

“Rizal as Postcolonial Liberal”

Claudio presented Rizal as being both a liberal and a radical. In his lecture, “The School of Suffering and the God of Liberty: Jose Rizal as Postcolonial Liberal,”he outlined the roots of Rizal’s liberalism and described the liberals as being the revolutionaries at the time, with Rizal articulating the goals of liberalism in his works and letters.

Claudio discussed Rizal’s notions of liberty and suffering. He said Rizal thought “one has to suffer pain to attain or deserve liberty,”and reiterated that “Filipino liberals learn through suffering.”"
UP High Class 1973 at ang “Iskolar ng Bayan”: Paano at Kailan Nagsimula ang Gamit Nito – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/up-high-class-1973-at-ang-iskolar-ng-bayan-paano-at-kailan-nagsimula-ang-gamit-nito/,"


2015: Mahaba ang pila sa LRT at MRT, siksikan sa bus, usad-pagong ang daloy ng trapiko sa EDSA mula Makati hanggang Philcoa. Mahuhuli na naman sa klase ang mga “iskolar ng bayan.” Kailan at paano nga ba nagsimulang gamitin ang katagang ito bilang pagtukoy sa mga mag-aaral ng Unibersidad ng Pilipinas (UP)?

1975: Isang “di malilimutang karanasan” ang araw-araw na pagbyahe ng isang estudyante ng UP Diliman mula Makati. “Matagal ka nang maghihintay ng bus tapos sangkaterbang tao ang nag-eeksudos o nag-eebakweyt papuntang Cubao,” ani ng estudyante. Kaya nang ki­nailangang magsulat ng isang sanaysay para sa “creative writing class” sa noon ay College of Arts and Sciences, isinulat ng naturang estudyante ang “Hiráp sa Sasakyan ang Iskolar ng Bayan.”

Ilang bahagi ng sanaysay:

Pag para ng bus, bababa ang dalawa, sasakay naman ang dalawampu. Sa malayo, parang mga langaw ang mga tao na nag-uunahan sa pag­dapo sa sugat ng isang batang taga Constitution Hill. . . . Sa wakas, kahit papano nakasabit ka rin. Mula sa estribo dahan-dahan kang sumis­ingit, “oops, sorry po.” Singit ka sa pagitan ng mga manggagawa, empleyado, mga estudiyante atbp. . . . Sa mala-sardinas na kondisyon ng loob ng bus, mangingiti ka kasi nakasakay ka na. . . . May problemang panibago . . . paano ang pagbabayad. Kasi hawak mo sa kaliwa ang “things” mo, ang kanan naman, nakakapit. Pero susubukan mo rin; kahit papano madudukot mo rin ang piso mong pang-one-way . . . . Kung sa tabi ka ng bintana nakaupo, susubukan mong lumanghap ng hangin, pero ‘yung hanging nala­langhap mo, may halong usok na itim at “pulbos ng gobyerno”. Bigla kang kakabahan, “Buo pa kaya ang bagâ ko?”

Sa isang chat, kamakailan, ikinwento niya na noong isinulat niya ang nasabing sanaysay, kalilipat lang nya sa kursong Philippine Studies. “Second year pa lang ako pero panahon ng martial law at ang expectation ko noon sa UP ay dapat may resistance, pero ito namang sinulat ko, wala namang kinalaman sa aktibismo, kung tutuusin,” dagdag niya.

“Pero isang bahagi ‘yun ng buhay-estudyante ng taga-UP noong panahon na ‘yon kaya isa itong reflection sa mga nangyayari noon.” Sa tingin nga niya eh “privileged” ang mag-aaral ng UP dahil pinag-aaral ng estado at tama lang na masabi niyang siya ay “iskolar ng bayan.”

“Ipakikita mo kasi kung saan ka nanggaling at kung saan ka papunta. May utang na loob ka sa kalidad ng edukasy­on na nakukuha mo at dahil sa pribelehiyong ibinigay sa ‘yo,” wika niya.

Sa unang sanaysay ginamit niya ang alyas na “P.P. Chugin” dahil sa klase ‘di dapat kilala ang may-akda kasi mga kak­lase ang susuri sa akda. Nang ito ay lumabas sa Philippine Collegian noong Agosto 26, 1975, Rodolfo de Leon ang ginamit niyang pen name. Rodolfo ang pangalan ng isa niyang kasamahang aktibista na napatay matapos sumanib sa NPA. De Leon naman ay apelyido ng isa pa ring kai­bigang aktibista.

Ayon kay Rizalina “Richie” Valencia, nang mabasa niya ang sanaysay ni Ollie (magkaklase sina Ollie at Richie sa creative writing class) naisip niyang gamitin ang “Iskolar ng Bayan” sa mga serye ng artikulo tungkol sa buhay-buhay ng mga mag-aaral sa Diliman.

Kaya noong Setyembre 3, 1975, nagkaroon ng buhay ang katauhan ng “Iskolar ng Bayan” nang ibinungad ni Richie sa kaniyang artikulo na “Ang estudyante raw sa UP, sabi nila, eh totoong palaisip at mapaghinala, isa sa mga pinakamakulit na tao sa mundo.”

In all the campuses of UP in the country, designated open spaces were filled with people rushing out of buildings in a “duck, cover, and hold” scenario shortly after alarms sounded at 2:15 PM, February 21, 2019. A large magnitude earthquake had supposedly just struck.

In UP Diliman, a communications center was organized under a tent on the basketball court of the UP Diliman Police headquarters. Two tables, chairs, and a white board were immediately set up; while a group of officers posted themselves on site with two-way radios. Soon, they were receiving radio reports from more than 250 deployed SSB (Special Services Brigade) operatives, security guards, and other police officers, whose jobs required them to be equipped with the communications device. On the white board, the receiving officers tallied reports on the number of “evacuees” and “casualties” in what is called a command post exercise for communications. On that day, it reported around 11,000 drill participants from more than 70 buildings on the Diliman campus.

Similar drills were performed in the rest of the UP System.

After a long, tiring academic year of remote learning and none of the fun college life on campus they had before the pandemic, students across the University of the Philippines (UP) System deserve a break. But then, who says UP’s online events and activities can’t be fun and creative? UP students may now be able to cross the distance between the campuses and meet their peers.

For this mid-year break 2021, UP has launched the “Isko, Iska, Break Muna Tayo: Midyear Competitions and Workshops for UP Students”.  Through this initiative, students across all UP constituent universities and campuses sustain their creative and critical thinking skills and get to know one another during the midyear break, despite the pandemic.

The UP Symphony Orchestra (UPSO), together with UP chorus classes and vocal groups Auit and UP Madrigal Singers, breathed life to spiritually inspired compositions for its second concert offering in 2019, “Faith, Hope & Devotion: Lenten Reflections in Music,” held on April 11, 2019 in the Abelardo Hall Auditorium of the UP Diliman College of Music.

The set was composed of the reflective “Jesus Christus, Gottes Sohn” of Johann Sebastian Bach and choruses from “Messiah Part Two” of George Frideric Handel, the introspective “Passage to Kublo” by UP professor Maria Christine Muyco, the cathartic and show-stopping “Francesca da Rimini” of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, and the  “Russian Easter Overture” by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, before it tapered off to an encore of a Manoling Francisco, SJ medley.

The well attended and well applauded performance was conducted by UPSO Music Director and UP Artist III Josefino Chino Toledo.

The orchestra, which is the official orchestra of the UP System, came fresh from the success of its initial concert offering in 2019, “Resist! Anthems of Struggle and Triumph”, which it performed in UP Diliman and UP Los Baños to sold out audiences. It had its inaugural performance, “Ang Unang Pasko  ng UP Symphony Orchestra”, on December 13, 2018 at the UP Diliman Amphitheater.

“Pandayan ng Bayan” (The Country’s Forge)—this is the theme for this year’s alumni events.

The annual Alumni Council Meeting (ACM) was held on August 23 at Ang Bahay ng Alumni, UP Diliman, and, as traditionally practiced, UP graduates gathered in the annual General Alumni Homecoming in the same venue on August 24. Both events were organized by the UP Alumni Association (UPAA).

The ACM features resource speakers from the roster of UPAA awardees. Their presentations provide the bases for the Council resolutions that help guide UPAA initiatives.

This year, the speakers were Ambassador Edgardo B. Espiritu, Most Distinguished Alumnus, and Department of Science and Technology Secretary Fortunato T. Dela Peña, a recipient of the Lifetime Distinguished Achievement Award. Espiritu talked about fighting corruption while Dela Peña discussed the country’s initiatives toward scientific development.

As he did last year, UP President Danilo L. Concepcion took the opportunity during the ACM to provide a few updates on the numerous development projects of the University. These include: the soon to be finished Student Union Building; the completed restoration of the Oblation Plaza; the construction of Philippine General Hospital Diliman; the completion and utilization of the Epsilon Chi Wellness Center; the construction of the Shopping Center; faculty and staff housing plans; the renovation of dormitories; plans for a bigger Balay Atleta; the renovation and upgrading of infirmaries; and, the new UP ID, which he said may be made available to alumni in the future.

Concepcion also shared the good news of UP’s climb in the London-based Times Higher Education list of top universities in Asia for 2019. UP went up 61 notches, breaking into the top 100 for the first time at 95th place from last year’s 156th, which also made it the fourth best university in Southeast Asia. He also said something that elicited the loudest cheer from the Council. Concepcion reminded them of what he said last year: that the UP men’s basketball team would become UAAP champions during his term.

The next day’s homecoming was a more relaxed, less serious gathering. It was divided into four parts. First was the opening, where the Alumni Council resolutions were presented and speeches were delivered by Concepcion and UPAA President and Alumni Regent Reynaldo C. Laserna.

(Photo by Misael Bacani, UP MPRO)

 

Supreme Court of the Philippines Associate Justice Marvic Mario Victor Leonen, commencement speaker of Pagtatapos 2019, contextualized his question by telling the UP Baguio (UPB) graduating class that, in the course of their careers, many professionals “lose appreciation of the social value of their profession.” He explained that “somewhere along the way, convenience takes the form of pragmatic silence. Expediency overwhelms conscience.”

Leonen urged the 423-strong UPB Class of 2019, “Be better than us. Make your existence more meaningful. Do not allow yourselves to be silenced. Do not be silent in the face of injustice. Do not succumb to the temptation of having more than just enough. Do not trade kindness with the false badges of success. When you come into power, discharge it for the public trust that it is. Do not temper principle with pragmatism. Do not hide behind comfortable acquiescence. Do not seek comfort at critical times. This will just disguise your complicity. Do not further enable and empower the status quo. Do not enrich yourself at the cost of others.”

To empower themselves and their communities “against the machinations of the powerful,” he asked the graduates to: read, analyze, understand, and be critical; engage others through conversation, not through digital media but face-to-face discussions; act on their beliefs; not look for and depend on heroes and heroines; and, have the courage to speak up.

The lone summa cum laude graduate, Kenworth Bryle Bal-iyang, earlier delivered a message on behalf of the graduating class. In his address, he shared his reflections on what makes the Iskolar ng Bayan excellent: critical thinking and grit. And as they were about to go from being students to alumni, Bal-iyang told his fellow graduates that if fellow alumni “do not live up to [our] values of honor and excellence, it is up to us to remind them of their obligations to the nation.”

Lil Abner Aquino, magna cum laude graduate of BA Language and Literature, spoke during the Ritwal ng Pagtatanglaw, a UP Baguio graduation tradition symbolizing the pursuit and sharing of knowledge. The flame of a single candle is used to light other candles, which in turn light up more candles, until all the candles held by the members of the graduating class have been lit. Tanglaw is a Filipino word for torch or source of light or illumination.

Aquino emphasized that he and his fellow graduates will fight for a better society and for the Filipino nation’s progress. Selfless service, sacrifice, the offering of oneself to the country—those are what it means to genuinely be a source of light in society, he said.

Pagtatapos 2019 was held on June 24 at the CAP-John Hay Trade and Cultural Center, Camp John Hay.

Of the 423 graduates, 413 earned undergraduate degrees and 10 were conferred master’s degrees. Joining Bal-iyang in the honor roll were five magna cum laude graduates and 54 cum laude graduates. The breakdown of graduates per college was as follows: 124 from the College of Arts and Communication; 161 from the College of Science; and, 138 from the College of Social Sciences.

Here are other photos of Pagtatapos 2019.

The Parish Church of the Holy Sacrifice, the circular structure with the unique dome within the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman campus, celebrated milestones in 2020.

The first milestone was the commemoration of the 65th anniversary of the completion and blessing of the Parish Church, more popularly known as the UP Chapel. It was blessed by the Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manila, Rufino Cardinal Santos, on December 20, 1955 after the completion of its construction.

To celebrate this event, a special Thanksgiving Mass was held on December 20, with Most Rev. Honesto F. Ongtioco, Bishop of Cubao, presiding over the celebration and Very Rev. Primitivo Viray Jr., SJ, Provincial of the Society of Jesus, co-presiding. As this was also the 6th day of Simbang Gabi,  the Mass was livestreamed on the UP Parish of the Holy Sacrifice’s Facebook page.

The second milestone was the completion of the repair, restoration and repainting of the UP Chapel by DMCI Homes, the real estate arm of DMCI Holdings through its wholly owned subsidiary DMCI Project Developers, Inc. (PDI).

DMCI Homes worked on rehabilitating the 65-year old national historical landmark and cultural treasure by repairing its old and worn-out parts and repainting its interior and its exterior facade. Work started in July 2020 and was completed in December.

For the chapel’s rehabilitation, DMCI Homes did a series of consultations with UP officials and UP Parish to address the immediate needs of the chapel and to ensure that its original state of beauty and elegance was maintained when the repairs were executed. The restoration of the UP Chapel was supposed to start in early 2020 but due to the pandemic, the restoration plan was pushed back to the latter part of the year.

Making resistance futile – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/making-resistance-futile/,"Making resistance futile
May 8, 2018 | Written by Andre DP Encarnacion



More than a century ago, a scientist named A.L. Melander wrote an article in the Journal of Economic Entomology on a disturbing turn of events in his native Washington. The year was 1914, and then, as now, farmers and entomologists were locked in combat with pests like the San Jose scale—an insect similar to the cocolisap that would nearly overwhelm the Philippine coconut industry a hundred years later.

Since its introduction in the US in the 1870s, the scale had been responsible for eliminating thousands of acres of apple trees. The frontline chemical to control it back then was sulphur-lime, an insecticide made by reacting calcium hydroxide with sulphur. Melander himself described the mixture as “fast acting” in its lethal effects. After years of success, however, to his great shock, Melander found that the insects were going against script. Some of the scales just refused to die.

More specifically, in samples taken from two Washington cities, he found that while insects from Wenatchee that he sprayed all died within a week, while 90% of the scales from Washington’s Clarkston Valley that he treated remained alive. Remarkably, even after Melander increased the active ingredient by ten times, 74% of the latter still survived.

Melander’s recounting of this phenomenon would become the first article ever to document insecticide resistance. For many, it was an ecological alarm bell. Researchers would eventually confirm that insect pests like the scale could take advantage of the laws of natural selection to better withstand insecticides over generations through metabolic or behavioural adaptations.

Against such a fast-adapting problem, it is up to scientists and farmers to update their own toolkits. For years, UP entomologist Dr. Ma. Anita “Marianne” Bautista has worked hard to do just that. And now as the head of the Philippine Genome Center’s (PGC) Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and Forestry Program, she’s spending her time trying to help others.

 

Lucky charm

Eventually, with complementary advances in genetics and genomics, scientists began to look into the molecular basis of insecticide resistance. While Melander went into the textbooks for his work on the San Jose scale, Bautista, too, has done considerable work on an insect pest she considers her “lucky charm”—the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostela L.).

The UP Los Baños graduate of BS Agriculture, major in Entomology, first started working with the moth as part of her thesis. Even before doing the genomics work that would become her trademark, she was already deeply interested in controlling its numbers. “Because it is a pest,” she says. “Your cabbage, your kale, your pechay—it is a notorious pest of those crops.”

Bautista, together with other scientists, had not only noticed that the moth and its voracious larvae were costing the world upwards of $2 billion annually, but that they had easily developed resistance to insecticides used on cruciferous crops. Her initial work on the moth as an undergraduate student led her to become a Monbukagakusho scholar, earning her PhD in Agricultural Science at Nagoya University. And it was there that she undertook her most popular research project to date.

While many of her peers at the time were looking into classical management systems to try and contain the pest, she wanted to see “at the level of the genes” what mechanisms were behind the moth’s resistance.

 

Drop by drop

The first question Bautista asked was: what genes and enzymes were responsible for the moth’s resistance? Zeroing in on resistance to the insecticide permethrin with professors Toshiharu Tanaka and Tadashi Miyata, she found a promising candidate in an enzyme called cytochrome P450.

“When the moth is exposed to insecticides, the tendency of the insect is to increase the expression of these enzymes,” she says . This means that the diamondback moths produces an increasing amount of cytochrome P450, which helps detoxify them from lethal chemicals. Most of these enzymes are found in the moth’s midgut and act via hydrolysis—breaking down permethrin with water and rendering it ineffective.

Because of these partnerships, Concepcion pointed out that the PGC is the best testimonial to the spirit of “bayanihan,” the Filipino value of working as a united community to reach a goal or complete a task.

The five-level building contains facilities for DNA sequencing and bioinformatics as the Center conducts research in the following areas: health; agriculture, livestock, fisheries, and forestry; biodiversity and ethnicity; and, computational genomics and systems biology.

 

 

One of the products of PGC research is Biotek-M, a dengue detection kit which won a gold medal at the Salon International des Inventions de Genève (International Exhibition of Inventions Geneva) early this year. It is accurate, rapid, and affordable.

Concepcion and UP Manila (UPM) Chancellor Carmencita Padilla, who was the PGC executive director from 2011 to 2016, revealed during the program that the equipment cost more than the construction of the building."

UP students, faculty, and researchers will soon have more library resources at their disposal. The University is currently at varying stages of procuring and deploying database subscriptions to enhance its library capabilities for remote and teaching and learning (RTL) across the UP System.

This was disclosed by UP Diliman (UPD) University Librarian Elvira Lapuz in her presentation during the University’s report on its roadmap for Academic Year 2020-2021 on January 11 via Zoom.

 

UP Diliman University Librarian Elvira Lapuz presents “System-wide Library Subscription Updates.” Screenshot of live Zoom event taken by Misael Bacani, UP MPRO.

 

According to Lapuz, four criteria guided the selection and evaluation of electronic resources for acquisition: content and source reliability; usability; vendor support; and, pricing models. These criteria were culled from the University Library Collection Development Policy v. 2020.

OpenAthens, “an authentication system for accessing electronic resources”, will be individually subscribed to by each constituent university (CU), with the UP System funding all subscriptions. Lapuz’s predecessor, Prof. Chito Angeles, who made the next presentation, said that OpenAthens has already been deployed in UPD and UP Los Baños. Full implementation across the UP System is expected by February.

Lapuz said subscriptions under the UP System were ScienceDirect and Scopus. Most, if not all CUs, recommended 11 additional databases for subscription by the UP System. These were: EBSCO Academic Search Complete; Cambridge Core; Emerald Premier with Access in Perpetuity; Gale Reference Complete; Global SpringerNature eJournals; JSTOR Arts and Science I-XI; Philippine eJournals; Project Muse Premium; ProQuest One Academic; Taylor & Francis Social Sciences and Humanities Collection; and, TurnItIn. On top of these, JoVE Unlimited will also be subscribed.

UP honors the passing of a beloved storyteller and National Artist – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/up-honors-the-passing-of-a-beloved-storyteller-and-national-artist/,"

National Artist Amelia Lapeña-Bonifacio

 

I join the University of the Philippines community and the country in mourning the passing of yet another of our country’s greats: National Artist for Theater and UP Professor Emeritus Amelia Lapeña-Bonifacio, who passed away in the morning of December 29, 2020 at the age of 90.

How do we honor the life of a storyteller as beloved as Lapeña-Bonifacio? By telling a story about her and her impact on the world of theater, puppetry and children’s education. During an arts festival in the 1970s in Washington DC, Lapeña-Bonifacio—Tita Amel to her many students, colleagues and friends—stirred up controversy when she offered American puppeteer Jim Henson three reasons his puppetry in “Sesame Street” would not click with Asian children. First, she pointed out, some of the characters on “Sesame Street” engaged in some violence for humorous effect at the time; second, the show’s scenes were too short; and third, some of the puppets’ physical antics could be seen as a sign of disrespect.

According to an article written by Cora Llamas and published in the Philippine Daily Inquirer, Lapeña-Bonifacio challenged Henson: “Remove the destructive elements like the breaking of plates. If kids have a short attention span, then how come our children back home can watch puppet shows for an hour? And, please, stop throwing all that food around. If that is funny to you Westerners, food for us Asians is almost sacred—it can be a matter of life or death.”

Henson paid attention and after the encounter, he created The Dark Crystal, a full-length puppetry-packed movie with Asian themes. But it was not the first nor would it be the last time that the lady, who would be known as the “Grand Dame of Southeast Asian Theater” and the “Mother of Philippine Puppetry”, would advocate for and create works demonstrating the unique values, cultural beliefs, and perspectives of Asian children by recreating the beauty of Asian and Filipino myths and legends through magnificent works in theater and puppetry for generations of children.

Lapeña-Bonifacio was recognized worldwide as an outstanding educator, author, puppeteer and theater icon, specializing in Japanese traditional theater, Southeast Asian traditional theater, and international children’s theater. She delved deep into the traditional theatre of the Philippines, and utilized Japanese Bunraku and Indonesian wayang or shadow puppets, to depict Asian folklore and Filipino mythology and make them appeal to her young audience."

Prof. Imee Su Martinez, PhD, director of UP Diliman’s Office for International Linkages-Diliman (UPOILD), led UPOILD staff members Aura Carbonilla, International Programs Officer for Student Mobility, and Noelle Rivera, International Programs Officer for Administrative and Legal Matters, in making the observation during a courtesy call-cum-meeting with her counterparts from Ferris University.

Martinez met with Prof. Chiho Ogaya of the Department of Communication Studies, Miho Sasaki, Manager of International Office, and Moe Arai, Chief of International Office, to discuss ways to further strengthen cooperation between the two universities.

Among other things, the meeting discussed the possibility of UP identifying select courses offered in English and a beginner Filipino language course that Japanese students can take in Diliman.

They also explored the need to insert a clause for automatic renewal in the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the two universities. The MOA, signed in 2017, is up for renewal in 2021.

The MOA, which provides for students of both universities to visit or study for a year in the partner institution, has allowed select students from the UPCIS-offered GS 197 Special Topics class on Japanese Traditional Performance Practice and members of two Japanese traditional performance groups based at the UPCIS, the UPCIS Noh Ensemble and the UPCIS Bunraku Ensemble, to come to Ferris University every November. Ferris University students come to UP Diliman in February.

Grants from Japan’s Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology’s Japan Student Services Organization (JASSO) and UP’s Mobility for Vigor and Excellence (MOVE-UP) provide UP students with the financial subsidy for their visits to Ferris University.

During those visits, the two groups of students tour each other around their campuses, host meals for their visiting counterparts, and discuss contemporary problems confronting their countries and deliberate on possible solutions.

An important highlight of the UP students’ visit to Ferris University is a performance of an excerpt from a Noh play and a Bunraku dance performance before their counterparts, many of whom have yet to watch these two Japanese theater traditions.

In previous visits, Ferris University students expressed admiration for their UP counterparts’ desire to learn about Japanese theater traditions.

Noh is an ancient elite theater tradition in Japan that developed in the 14th century and Bunraku is the traditional puppet theater that began in the 17th century.

UP students receive Noh and Bunraku training from Japanese masters and culture-bearers, respectively, and from a group of Filipino teachers personally taught by these Japanese. During their visits to Japan, students devote part of their time in training sessions with the masters – those in Noh train in Tokyo, while those in Bunraku train on the island of Naoshima.

UP’s ode to joy: The UP Symphony Orchestra performs Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony for the UP Community – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/ups-ode-to-joy-the-up-symphony-orchestra-performs-beethovens-ninth-symphony-for-the-up-community/,"

In 1770, Ludwig van Beethoven was born and baptized in Bonn, in the Holy Roman Empire. He would grow up to become one of the greatest composers of all time.

In 2020, the world will celebrate the 250th anniversary of Beethoven’s birth. In anticipation of this, the UP Symphony Orchestra (UPSO), under the musical direction of Prof. Josefino “Chino” Toledo, the chairperson of the Department of Composition and Theory, UP College of Music, held its run-up to Beethoven’s birth anniversary with “Canticles of Joy: Proclaiming the Joy of the Season with the Complete Monumental Beethoven Symphony No. 9 and the Works of Prokofiev and Alcala”, which was held on December 7, 2019 at the Abelardo Hall Auditorium.

“Canticles of Joy” was a massive production organized by the UPSO, the UP College of Music and the UP Office of the President. It is a fitting tribute to the composer who created the iconic symphony, also known as “Ode to Joy” after the poetic fourth and final movement. Aside from Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9, the UPSO also performed “Troika” from Sergei Prokofiev’s Lieutenant Kije Suite, and the Magi’s Journey (Composer’s Notes) by Nilo Alcala, then led the audience in singing four traditional Christmas carols after the performance of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony.

With members of the UPSO hailing from various UP constituent units, the production was a UP System-wide collaboration. Aside from the UPSO, the performers included four vocal soloists: soprano Angeli Benipayo, mezzo-soprano Michelle Mariposa, tenor Malvin Macasaet, and baritone Jeconiah Retulla; as well as four UP choirs in the chorus: the UP Madrigal Singers, led by conductor Prof. Mark Anthony Carpio; the UP Concert Chorus, led by Prof. Janet Sabas-Aracama; the UP Singing Ambassadors, headed by Dr. Ed Manguiat; and the UP Staff Choral Society, headed by Mr. Chris M. Reyes. Joining the chorus were UP College of Music students from the chorus classes of Prof. Aracama, Prof. Carpio and Prof. Beverly Shangkuan-Cheng.

And while “Canticles of Joy” had limited seating due to its venue, this performance of what could be considered Beethoven’s grandest opus will be offered for free to the UP community and the greater public in an open-air concert dubbed “Liwanag ng Pasko sa [Ka]Diliman: Musikang Handog ng Orkestra ng Bayan”. This free concert, organized by the UP Office of the President, the UP Diliman Office of the Chancellor and the UP College of Music, will be held on Thursday, Dec. 12, 2019, 6:00 p.m., at the University Amphitheater. It will feature Jourdann Petalver as pianist and Lara Maigue as singer. In addition, the performing choirs, which will include the UP Cherubim and Seraphim, will serenade the audience with their own spot musical numbers.

Ang Orkestra ng Bayan

The performance of this classical opus marks the UPSO’s second Christmas offering to the UP Community. Tagged as the Orkestra ng Bayan, the UPSO was established by the UP Board of Regents as the official UP System-wide orchestra in its 1337th meeting on August 30, 2018.

“For us, the UPSO, this is going to be our first complete symphony performed,” Prof. Toledo said in an interview during rehearsals at Abelardo Hall for the “Canticles of Joy”. “The UPSO was started only a year ago, so it’s a rather young orchestra. In spite of that, we’re trying to do a big piece of work ,” he added. Of course, being a young orchestra does not mean the UPSO is short of talent, brilliance, and experience in handing complex musical works. “Challenge-wise, we’ve played more difficult pieces; so we’re used to performing complex musical works. But it’s always different. We’re going to perform a longer piece of work, so it’s a little harder in terms of the clean-up of lines, in terms of narrative. But in terms of complexity, we’ve performed many, more complex pieces before.”

For Prof. Toledo, the UPSO’s function is three-fold: “One is to promote Filipino music, especially composition that’s written by UP composers. And this is going to be a laboratory orchestra of young conductors, and a repertory orchestra of the musicians. The problem is, when musicians go to bigger orchestras, even here and abroad, they need to have a certain amount of training and repertoire familiarity, so I think we can provide that kind of solution to that very big gap.” The UPSO maintains a roster of 65 members exclusively from within the UP Community, including alumni, students, faculty and staff from all UP campuses. Aside from providing the training ground for both composers and musicians, the UPSO serves as a representative not only of the University, but also of the country on the worldwide stage. The UPSO aims to mount at least six major concerts in every season.

Ode to Joy

Since it was first performed on May 7, 1824, Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony has been considered one of the best known works in common practice music, one of the greatest achievements in western music history, and one of the most often performed and recognizable symphonies in the world. “This is something that we don’t get to perform often,” said Prof. Mark Carpio.

“It’s also a rest from the annual performance of  Handel’s Messiah, so this is something new to the ears. And we believe it’s something that everybody should listen to at least once in their lives,” Carpio added.

Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony is also significant in other ways. It is longer and more complex than any symphony to date, and requires a larger orchestra. It is also the first “choral symphony”, and Beethoven the first major composer to incorporate voices in the final movement, with four vocal soloists and a chorus singing the words of Friedrich Schiller’s poem “Ode to Joy”.

“It’s always challenging to make several choirs sing together, because when several choirs join together, it becomes a totally new choir,” said Carpio. “We have more than a hundred singers and we are only given a few rehearsals with the orchestra.”

Prof. Janet Sabas-Aracama also considers the piece itself challenging. “It’s really so wide, and while we are all talented here in UP, we also have many young singers in the choirs, so their vocal ranges are being somewhat stretched. But they are very diligent in studying the pieces, so I think we will overcome,” she added with a smile.

UP College of Music Dean La Verne C. de la Peña notes that the musical performance is a labor of love for the musicians and production crew involved. “We are self-funded. Of course, the UP Symphony Orchestra is receiving funding from the UP System, but that’s only good for the musicians’ allowances.” Not included are the meals for the musicians, chorus members and production crew for every rehearsal, which Dean de la Peña considers the biggest challenge. Another challenge? “Looking for time to rehearse, because rehearsals and the performance also coincide with Hell Week, the Music students’ recitals and all that. So you can imagine how challenging it is for many of our students.” And because the Symphony also includes people from other campuses, some coming from UP Manila or as far away as UP Los Baños,  attending rehearsals means braving the horrendous Metro Manila traffic, going home late, then having to wake up early the next day to go to work or to class. “This is the life of a musician in our Community,” de la Peña remarked.

What is academic freedom and why the fuss? – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/what-is-academic-freedom-and-why-the-fuss/,"


Academic freedom. The term has been tossed around so much in recent weeks, on social media, in the news, on the streets, but what is it really? And why are people so determined to defend it?

 

Screenshot of live Zoom event taken by Rad Agustin, UP MPRO.

 

The recent abrogation by the Department of National Defense (DND) of its 1989 Accord with the University thrust the subject of academic freedom into the larger public sphere. The subsequent red-tagging of UP alumni by the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), which DND Secretary Delfin Lorenzana later acknowledged as an “unpardonable gaffe” and which the AFP apologized for, only served to intensify public discussion.

To put things in perspective, UP organized Usapang KP (Kalayaan sa Pamantasan), an online discussion series that intends to dive into the nuances of academic freedom. Its first episode, “Mga Terror, Hindi Terrorista,” was streamed live on February 4 and focused on defining academic freedom and its significance to the life of a university.

Watch the replay of the webinar on TVUP’s YouTube channel.

The episode featured alumnae and revered professors emeriti, Dr. Solita Monsod (Economics) and Dr. Gisela Concepcion (Marine Science) as main speakers. Reactors were: fellow alumni Atty. Soledad Deriquito Mawis, Dean of the College of Law, Lyceum of the Philippines University; Dr. Giovanni Tapang, Dean of the College of Science, UP Diliman; and, Atty. Theodore Te of the Free Legal Assistance Group. It was moderated by Professor Emeritus Jose Dalisay Jr., and Malou Mangahas, Co-founder and Board Member, Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism.

So what is academic freedom?

While the 1987 Philippine Constitution states in Article XIV, Section 5 (2) that “Academic freedom shall be enjoyed in all institutions of higher learning”, it does not define academic freedom.

The reason for this lack of definition can be found in the deliberations of the 1986 Constitutional Commission on September 9. Commissioner Adolf Azcuna said, “Since academic freedom is a dynamic concept and we want to expand the frontiers of freedom, especially in education, therefore, we will leave it to the courts to develop further the parameters of academic freedom. We just say that it shall be enjoyed in all institutions of higher learning.”

US Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter’s concurring opinion in Sweezy v. New Hampshire (1957), widely acknowledged as having captured the essence of academic freedom, has found its way into Philippine jurisprudence. Monsod, Mawis, and Te cited Frankfurter’s opinion that academic freedom consists of the “four essential freedoms” of a university “to determine for itself on academic grounds who may teach, what may be taught, how it shall be taught, and who may be admitted to study.”

 

Dr. Gisela Concepcion says a form of freedom of expression for scientists is the publication of their research, where they subject themselves to the scrutiny of their peers. Screenshot of live Zoom event taken by Arlyn VCD Palisoc Romualdo, UP MPRO.

 

For Concepcion, it is the freedom “to pursue knowledge without boundaries in an unencumbered and enabling environment.” Faculty members, she said, have earned the right to mentor and teach through years of study, research, and training that allowed them to gain expertise.

Academic freedom, she added, exists in an academic framework, a highly complex system that contains not only the functions of universities and their players, but also the factors that affect the successful execution of these functions toward the overarching goal of serving the nation and humanity. Concepcion said academic freedom is ensured by external support, including support from the government, which provides the encouraging atmosphere for teaching, learning, inquiry, and discussion to thrive and flourish.

 

Dr. Solita Monsod clarifies that neither academic freedom nor tenure protects incompetent teachers from losing their jobs. It does not protect faculty members “from colleague or student challenges to or disagreement with their education philosophies and practices” and it does not shield them “from sanctions for professional misconduct.” Screenshot of live Zoom event taken by Arlyn VCD Palisoc Romualdo, UP MPRO.

 

Monsod, quoting UP Diliman Chancellor Fidel Nemenzo, focused on academic freedom in UP, said that it is the “freedom to challenge orthodoxies and established ways of thinking and acting without fear of repression or punitive action. This freedom is essential for the life of the mind and for UP’s dual role as (a) knowledge producer and (b) social critic.”

However, she emphasized that academic freedom is not “unlimited”. Among others, it does not mean “a faculty member can harass, threaten, intimidate, ridicule, or impose his or her views on students.” It also “does not protect faculty members from non-university penalties if they break the law.”

 

Why is it important?

It is critical to a university’s role in clarifying and seeking truth, Tapang explained. Academic freedom allows an environment that is “most conducive to speculation, experimentation, and creation. . . . If we are unable to speak our mind with intellectual honesty, what else would the university be for us?” Borrowing Albert Einstein’s words, he added that “any restriction on academic freedom [hampers] the dissemination of knowledge among people and thereby impedes rational judgment and action.”

 

Dr. Giovanni Tapang agrees with Albert Einstein’s opinion that while everyone is involved in defending constitutional rights, intellectuals are “in a special position” since they have a “strong influence on the formation of public opinion.” Screenshot of live Zoom event taken by Arlyn VCD Palisoc Romualdo, UP MPRO.

 

Monsod made reference to Britannica on the justification for academic freedom. That it “lies not in the comfort or convenience of teachers and students but in the benefits to society; i.e., the long-term interests of a society are best served when the educational process leads to the advancement of knowledge, and knowledge is best advanced when inquiry is free from restraints by the state, by the church or other institutions, or by special-interest groups.”

 

Atty. Theodore Te explains that academic freedom, as guaranteed by the 1987 Philippine Constitution in all institutions of higher learning, “is understood to cover everyone within that institution.” Screenshot of live Zoom event taken by Arlyn VCD Palisoc Romualdo, UP MPRO.

Historical budget allotments for UP during PNoy’s term – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/historical-budget-allotments-for-up-during-pnoys-term/,"

The Benigno Aquino III administration saw a robust period in the development history of UP.

In the period between June 30, 2010 to June 30, 2016, the government allotted the biggest budgets for UP ever. It also got substantial grants from other national agencies. The UP budget started to increase in 2013 to P9.5 billion from P5.7 billion in 2012. By 2017, the budget had reached P13.5 billion.

These enabled the national university to build and refurbish infrastructure, fund world-class research projects and human resources development, and kick off its digital modernization.

The biggest percentage increase in the UP budget was the MOOE allocation, the budget for operating expenses, which jumped almost four times, from P0.7 billion in 2012 to P2.8 billion in 2016. The capital outlay amounted to over P12 billion for the period 2012-2016, including a supplemental release in 2012. “These were unprecedented achievements,” said Alfredo Pascual in his end-of-term report as UP President.

This period also saw the legislation and enactment of a law automatically qualifying public high school honor graduates for admission in UP. Salary standardization during this term also enabled the University to offer competitive salaries and benefits for Balik Scientists and PhDs, the term used to describe alumni who have achieved prominent stature abroad and who go back to the country to serve their alma mater.

Golden age of infrastructure and new research

Coinciding with the Philippine president’s term of office, UP President Alfredo Pascual’s administration from February 10, 2011 to February 9, 2017 was able to invest more than P9 billion in infrastructure resulting in over 100 new buildings and other structures, and 50 major renovations in the various campuses. At the UP Philippine General Hospital, some P3 billion was spent for modernizing hospital equipment.

“We set out to transform UP into a research intensive University, building new laboratories, and absorbing billions of pesos of research funding from partner departments of government. From UP’s own resources, we provided our faculty with close to a billion pesos to fund our Emerging
Interdisciplinary Research program,” Pascual said.

From other agencies such as the Department of Science and Technology and the Commission on Higher Education, as of 2016, funding for University projects had reached P6.2 billion. These included various scientific projects across the UP System and 11 projects on information infrastructure development and health innovation, and translational medicine. Specifically, the projects included anti-malaria research, dengue detection, genomics capacity building, environmental monitoring, resilient village-based systems, and cost-effective printing fabrication.

Notable among the projects was the Philippine Genome Center, launched in 2011, which now serves a key role in the government’s fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. It received P340 million from UP’s capital outlay to build its headquarters and P1 billion for its research.

Over a billion pesos in capital outlay also went to the National Institutes of Health for its new, 18-story building, while it received the same amount for research for three years alone, from 2013 to 2015.

The P200 million budget for the new College of Medicine building and equipment was approved about the same time. About P950 million was made available for emerging interdisciplinary research, and P50 million for research grants to Balik PhDs. The administration was also able to set aside P80 million for infrastructure and P120 million for equipment for the UP Visayas Regional Research Center.

The UP System, with its Center for Integrative and Development Studies, had more than P50 million to allocate for another set of research focused on environment, employment, economic emancipation, and education.

Aside from public-funded infrastructure projects, UP also saw a number of privately funded buildings being erected, such as the P400 million UP-BGC, the P200 million UP Manila Public Health Building, and the P100 million UP Diliman College of Arts and Letters Theater.

Trillanes IV in his capacity as UP NCPAG Alumni Association President, UP President Alfredo Pascual, and UP NCPAG Dean Edna Co. Photo by the Malacañang Photo Bureau.

 

Faculty, researcher grants

According to Pascual, the full cost to the University of doctoral studies overseas could reach as much as P9 million per faculty member during that time, on top of the salary that the grantee kept, and the salary of his or her substitute. “In the last five years, we have awarded fellowship grants to 100 faculty members, translating to an average of 20 per year or double those in the previous administration,” Pascual reported.

More travel grants were awarded to faculty members and graduate students so that they could present their research papers in conferences abroad. “No longer tied down by quotas, we gave out over 330 grants since 2012 apart from those funded by individual colleges and universities.”

UP was able to have funds for new awards, the ONE UP Professorial Chair and Faculty Grant Awards, and to provide 800 professorial chairs and faculty grants at P120,000 and P96,000 a year, respectively,
for three years starting January 2016. Close to 600 faculty members received the grants for their distinguished performance in any two of the following: teaching, research or creative work, and public service.

The Creative Work and Research Grant was raised to P450,000 to P650,000 for a 1.5-year project enhanced to reward exemplary teachers and researchers for prolific publishing, developing excellent educational materials, and effectively using these materials in their classes in UP.

Staff benefits

With greater financial flexibility, a result of greater government funding and intensified internal resource generation, UP was able to gain a total of P3.4 billion which it used to pay for faculty and staff benefits from 2011 to January 2017.

According to Pascual, this figure was considered the biggest increase ever in such benefits, which included the service recognition pay, retirement money, rice subsidy, grocery allowance, and incentive grants."

UP welcomed top officials of Soka University with ceremonies that celebrated the multifaceted connection between the universities and between their people.

The visit by Soka University Board of Trustees Chair Yasunori Tashiro, Office of International Affairs Director Hiroki Shimoide, and International Program Coordinator Emmie Miyagawa on September 24, 2019 included: a tour of the Balay Kalinaw and of a donation to the complex of eight photographs taken by their university’s founder; and, the opening of the “Seeds of Hope” exhibit of an international Buddhist network at the Palma Hall Lobby.

Tashiro, Shimoide, and Miyagawa were met by: esteemed personalities of the University, led by former UP President Jose Abueva and UP Diliman (UPD) Chancellor Michael Tan; members of the Buddhist network, Soka Gakkai International (SGI), in the Philippines; and, alumni and visiting students of Soka University in the Philippines.

“Balay Kalinaw is a symbol of our friendship of over 30 years with the University of the Philippines,” Tashiro said, after visiting the complex.

He relayed Ikeda’s message where he recalled the inauguration of the Balay Kalinaw on May 11, 1993, when Ikeda quoted Jose Rizal’s poem on dying without seeing the dawn. In one essay about that occasion, Ikeda narrated an emotional connection with Abueva, whose family was a casualty of the last world war. Ikeda had spoken of his own family’s sufferings from the war, and that he, like Abueva, became committed to world peace as a result.

Ikeda first met Abueva in 1990, after which they corresponded regularly with each other. Ikeda officially visited UP in 1991 to attend the graduation ceremonies. Their discussions, both face-to-face and written, formed the framework of a recently published work.

The Balay Kalinaw became a major project of the Abueva presidency. Named with the Visayan word for “peace”, the structure offers spaces for many academic and related events, social gatherings, offices, and housing.

“We are convinced that Dr. Ikeda’s photos will warmly watch over the people who come to visit this place in search of peace,” Tashiro said.

“I sincerely wish today’s conferral [of photographs] ceremony will lead to further development and exchange between the two universities,” Ikeda was quoted by Tashiro. Tashiro narrated how Ikeda once again alluded to Jose Rizal in saying:”Educational exchange is the soil in which the seeds of peace will sprout and grow.”

Theater for community and nation – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/theater-for-community-and-nation/,"Theater for community and nation
June 19, 2018 | Written by J. Mikhail Solitario



At age 14, as a young theater enthusiast, Professor Glecy Atienza tried to convince high school principals to establish and maintain theater groups in their schools. During her lunch breaks, she would take a bus to Manila and speak to principals and convince school administrators to encourage students to experience theater by writing and performing.

Atienza started in high school as a member of UP High School’s Drama Club, a dream that she had since grade school. Coming from a family of actors and performers, she says that genetics must have led to her interest in the arts. She attended a workshop at the Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA) facilitated by Lino Brocka, who challenged the attendees to stay in theater.

After gathering enough support and participation from pilot schools such as UP High School, Philippine Science High School, Stella Maris College, Manuel Roxas High School, and Lourdes School, Glecy and her group were able to launch the first Dula-Daluyan Festival under the Metropolitan Teen Theater League which she chaired during the martial law years.

While in college, Glecy stayed with PETA, visiting communities during Lent and Christmas and training them to perform Lenten rites and Panunuluyan. Performances featured originally written works because these pieces reflected the experience of the writers and performers. Atienza relays how they were able to make their system sustainable by ensuring that the performers who graduated from their schools came back to become trainers. These individuals eventually banded together and founded the Alyansa ng mga Manggagawang Pang-Kultura sa Kamaynilaan at Karatig-Pook (Alyansa). The alliance of 31 performing groups in the National Capital Region pooled resources from solicitations and held a festival called “Gawing Ganap and Sining at Kultura sa Paaralan at Komunidad” at the Quezon Memorial Circle.

An offshoot of the Alyansa is Guro sa Sining, whose members have retained the orientation of civic-mindedness and immersion in the community. Being a member of the NCCA’s network, the group came up with “Agap, Iglap, Handa”, a forum theater project on disaster preparedness after earthquakes hit Bohol. The group’s pilot area was Pandacan and Sta. Mesa in Manila, where they taught community members what to do, where to go, and what to bring in the event of a disaster such as Metro Manila’s “The Big One.” The training resembled theater rehearsals where movements are practiced and coordinated.

Theater as social research

Community theater is not based on a geographic or locational community such as a residential area. It is now seen as an avenue or a platform where members of a community come together to work on a project.

Atienza recalls a play called “Taya” (formerly “Pataya, Patihaya”) which dealt with drugs, a recommendation of one of their members from Malabon. In 2002, Atienza conducted research but found in difficult to acquire knowledge because people feared discussing the subject openly. When the play was rewritten using local terms and context-based language, the reception was better. She still recognizes that tackling local issues will always carry some danger with it, precisely because it might actually involve the neighbors you constantly interact with, unlike the discussion of national issues which are perceived to be more detached.

To Atienza, theater involves all forms of art: song, movement, dance, literature and writing. She works with the idea of ”ganap” with theater’s live component, which necessitates community involvement through actual participation in the performance, being a member of the audience, or giving offstage assistance such as lending props, costumes, and materials for stage design."

The House of Representatives and the Department of the Interior and Local Government are keen on beginning charter change discussions while the country is mitigating the effects of COVID-19. But what changes does the 1987 Constitution actually need? And how has the pandemic exacerbated key constitutional issues?

MOVE UP and spend a semester abroad – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/move-up-and-spend-a-semester-abroad/,"MOVE UP and spend a semester abroad
February 8, 2018 | Written by Andre DP Encarnacion



There were many things that Lia Soliongco liked about her stint as an exchange student at the University of Trento in Trento, Italy. But one of her absolute favorites was her time spent in the dormitory kitchen. She said that beyond serving as a common area for cooking and dining, the kitchen became a bustling arena for cultural exchange.

“My floormates and I were so close and we had our own international dinners where you would cook food from your own place—and if you can’t cook, you could just bring something,” says the Voice major from the UP Diliman College of Music. “The guy I was in the same program with, he was also Filipino, and we would always share our food. Because my floormates were also curious—what is Filipino food?”

Lia’s opportunity to experience another country’s culture and teaching system is one not many get to have, even in UP. The UP Office of International Linkages (UP OIL), however, under Director Gil S. Jacinto, has been offering a program since 2014 to help UP students earn that same opportunity with potentially full financial support. The program is called the University of the Philippines Mobility for Vigor and Excellence (MOVE UP), and it’s open to all UP undergraduates after their freshman year who have been accepted into the student exchange program of a foreign partner university.

MOVE UP, Jacinto says, provides support for undergraduate students seriously looking to spend a semester abroad in one of UP’s global partner institutions. “If a student has excellent grades and applies in their second or third year for a posting abroad, the University can help that student cover the cost of travel, and even travel insurance. Students don’t have to pay tuition fees because we have reciprocal partnership agreements with these universities.”

For parents, saving up to help cover the remaining expenses of their children’s semesters abroad has never been easier, Jacinto adds, due to the free tuition law. Under RA 10931, the household of a child that used to be classified under Bracket A of what used to be the Socialized Tuition System (STS) can now save roughly P35,000 per semester for this purpose. But the support that the University is willing to offer to less financially fortunate students goes farther still.

“The exchange program doesn’t discriminate,” Jacinto explained. “MOVE UP provides support depending on your capacity to pay. If you  happen to be in what used to be STS brackets D and E, the University will pay for most of your needs for your stint abroad.” This means that MOVE UP scholars can potentially receive subsidies not only for insurance and airfare, but also for their accommodations and living expenses, as well.

The road less traveled

One of the bonuses Jacinto and his office want for every MOVE UP scholar is for their courses to be credited (or to be complementary) to a student’s current academic track, with the approval of his or her program adviser. This sense of complementarity, at least in essence, was one of the main reasons Lia decided to spend her semester in Trento, which offered the budding classical singer a chance to broaden her linguistic and cultural horizons.

For others, however, like Michelle Danne Desuyo, a BS Agricultural Chemistry student from UP Los Baños, academic life abroad was far less straightforward, but equally rewarding. Michelle, who was an exchange student at the University of Oviedo in Spain last year, found herself in the Faculty of Economics and Business. There, she took courses she hadn’t previously considered taking—Accounting, Human Resource Management, and the Economy of the European Union, among others.

Two years after the first formal agreement was signed between the University of the Philippines and a university from Southern Taiwan, 44 delegates composed mostly of academics from Southern Taiwan met with their counterparts from the UP System on August 1, 2018 at the UP Diliman Institute of Environmental Science and Meteorology (IESM). The event, “Briefing on the UP System International Linkages and the Envisioned Taiwan-Philippine University Collaborations”, featured thematic workshops where UP experts joined their Southern Taiwanese colleagues in discussions geared towards shaping future inter-university collaborations between those involved.

The Taiwanese delegation was composed of members from: Taiwan’s Legislative Yuan, Taiwan’s Ministry of Education and Ministry of Economic Affairs, National Kaohsiung University of Science and Technology, Kaohsiung Medical University, Chang Jung Christian University, National Taitung University, Soochow University, National Chiayi University, National Chung Cheng University, National Chung Hsiung University, National Cheng Kung University, National Sun Yat-Sen University, AgriGaia Social Enterprise, Greatlink Travel Service Co., Ltd., Edu-Connect Southeast Asia Association, and the Kindness Chain Hotel.

Workshop themes were determined by their impact on regional poverty and inequality alleviation. These areas were: 1) Agriculture, Horticulture, Marine Technology, Aquaculture and Aquatic Products; 2) Public Health and Tropical Disease Preventions; 3) Disaster Prevention and Resilience Management, and Public Safety; and, 4) Technological Advancement and Social Entrepreneurship.

These dialogues presented opportunities for researchers across UP’s various campuses to get to know their Southern Taiwanese colleagues, and to jointly discuss how collaborations could arise from their respective strengths. According to Chair Professor Eing-Ming Wu of Shu Te University, these conversations were part of an ongoing effort of “reshaping the past”, from a mindset where the Philippines and Taiwan were seen as developing in isolation, to one where both nations see each other as close friends and partners.

The University of the Philippines received a Silver Anvil in the 56th Anvil Awards of the Public Relations Society of the Philippines (PRSP) in recognition of two of the University’s public service programs.

The Silver Anvil represents high standards met by the UP programs in the category of “public relations programs carried out on a sustained basis” for urban or rural community development.

These were the Gawad Pangulo for Excellence in Public Service (GPEPS) and the Colleges and Universities Public Service Conference (CUPSCon), both conceptualized and implemented by the UP Padayon Public Service Office (PPSO) since 2015 with the support of the UP Office of the Vice President for Public Affairs (OVPPA).

According to PRSP, there were 534 entries of public relations programs and tools, of which only 138 won Silver and Gold Anvils. The entries were screened by 65 Public Relations and Communication professionals, with each qualifier judged by a five-person multi-sectoral jury.

There were 85 other programs that won Silver Anvils this year, but UP’s programs were the only awardees from an academic institution.

This year’s awards theme was “PR for Good” or “purpose-driven and impactful initiatives that promote corporate integrity and the social good during crises and across platforms,” said Maria Luisa Sebastian, the 56th Anvil Awards chair.

“We congratulate all the winners. They serve as role models in our industry,” PRSP President Norman Agatep added.

UP Vice President for Public Affairs Elena Pernia, UP Assistant Vice President for Public Affairs Jose Wendell Capili, PPSO Director Jeanette Yasol-Naval, and PPSO senior project assistant Charles Jason Ramos received the award on behalf of UP at the Gabi ng Parangal, held on February 19, 2021 via livestream.

GPEPS recognizes the best and innovative public service programs across UP to inspire support and replication of their best practices. Nineteen programs have been given the award and prize money that may be used to expand the program or initiate a new one. The awardees were subsequently showcased in CUPSCon, giving them the opportunity to be adopted by other higher education institutions (HEIs).

Raising Public Service Awareness in UP – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/raising-public-service-awareness-in-up/,"


Republic Act 9500, also known as the UP Char­ter, mandates the University of the Philippines to “lead as a public service university by providing various forms of community, public, and volunteer service, as well as scholarly and technical assistance to the government, the private sector, and civil society while maintaining its standards of excellence.”

Public service is one of UP’s key responsibilities as the national university. But the actual performance of public service is one thing, while the act of co­ordinating, harmonizing, and standardizing public service initiatives among eight constituent units in 21 campuses is another feat altogether. This is where the Padayon Public Service Office (Padayon) enters the scene. Padayon is a Visayan word that means “to do promptly, and unceasingly”—an apt description of how UP must tirelessly and relentlessly serve the people.

These lofty goals will not be realized without an office at the UP System level to centralize efforts to monitor programs, provide technical assistance, and recommend policies to respond to the needs of UP’s various publics when it comes to volunteerism, community engage­ment, and sustainable development.

We spoke to Padayon’s project managers to discuss exist­ing initiatives and how these are implemented, as well as future plans to maintain and improve the public character of the University.

Institutionalizing initiatives

In order to assess UP’s compliance with its mandate, a system for reporting public service initiatives is needed. This system is provided by the UP Informa­tion Technology Development Center (UP ITDC) through the Public Service Module of the Human Resource Information System (HRIS) of the Univer­sity Information System. The template was devel­oped in partnership with the UP System Committee on Public Service Monitoring and Reporting."

We Are Family! – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/we-are-family/,"

2015 UPOU Family Day (Photo from UPOU Information Office)

 

We’re not just colleagues. We treat each other like family.” This is how Dr. Jean Saludadez, UP Open University (UPOU) Vice Chancellor for Finance and Administration, describes how UPOU employees relate to each other.

The community of roughly 200, based in the UPOU Los Baños headquarters and scattered across several learning centers in the Philippines, makes time to cultivate interpersonal relationships, which the UPOU administration actively supports.

“Our leadership has always had the heart for all who work here, whether faculty or staff, permanent or contractual,” says Human Resources Development Office chief Michael Lagaya, who has been with UPOU since 1998.

 

Celebrating milestones

It’s not uncommon for institutions to commemorate foundation day anniversaries. Celebrating growth and progress, they’re milestones for many organizations.

In UPOU, Foundation Day has two components—the formal anniversary program with “outsiders,” and the informal gathering of “insiders.” Institutional milestones are celebrated in the former, while the people behind the institution take center stage in the latter. It’s in that informal setting, an exclusive “for UPOU people” event, where its best workers are recognized.

The UPOU Service Awards, which began in 2000, recognize length of service in multiples of five years. UPOU was five years old at that time. Over the years, the Service Awards program has included honoring employees for other achievements.

The Gawad Chancellor rewards exemplary service by faculty, administrative staff, and research, extension, and professional staff (REPS). Research grants, professorial chairs, and other incentives are given those who have published scholarly works.

These are of course not unique to UPOU. What makes them different, especially in the area of scholarship, is that administrative staff members are included.

“We give both the academic and non-academic sectors the opportunity to undertake research. We don’t believe that scholarship can only come from faculty or research staff,” says Saludadez. In fact, some administrative staff members have traveled abroad to present their papers in conferences.

 

Family Day

By 2015, when UPOU marked its second decade of existence, the Service Awards had evolved into “Family Day.” Lagaya and Saludadez recall that the idea came up in one of their meetings for the celebration.

“It’s not just a label or a title. It’s the result of our reflection on UPOU’s 20 years. Our anniversary really is a celebration of our UPOU family—our teamwork, the work challenges we overcome together, the personal struggles we help each other through,” says Saludadez.

Just like family gatherings, the UPOU Family Day celebrates the accomplishments of its family members such as receiving awards, winning competitions, and earning degrees. This year, the event had a surprise award called “UPOU Face of the Year.” It was given to employees who best promoted institutional visibility and showcased UPOU’s “face” to the world, through social media and other online platforms, and even through UPOU souvenir items.

Family Day is like a well-attended reunion, says Saludadez.

“Our staff members from the learning centers all over the country fly out to attend Family Day. It’s that important to them.”

How important is Family Day to the administration?

“It’s a must. Even if we are swamped with organizing other anniversary activities like conferences, exhibits, and competitions, we don’t skip Family Day,” Lagaya says.

After his acceptance, Nemenzo formally swore in his executive staff composed of: Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs Maria Theresa Payongayong; Vice Chancellor for Administration Adeline Pacia; Vice Chancellor for Research and Development Gonzalo Campoamor; Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Louise Jashil Sonido; Vice Chancellor for Community Affairs Aleli Bawagan; and, Vice Chancellor for Planning and Development Raquel Florendo.

Accompanying Nemenzo and serving as witnesses to his investiture were members of his family, Dr. Maria Victoria Raquiza and Julio Anton Mulawin Nemenzo.

In his investiture speech, he spoke of the anchor of his governance, his administration’s response to the pandemic, and his administration’s thrusts of academic excellence, operational efficiency, and the community’s health and well-being.

Having been nurtured by UP Diliman from his childhood to the present, he accepted the call to serve it as “pag-aalay” to the institution. “Everything that we have done in the past year and everything that we plan to do for the rest of my term are anchored on my vision for UP Diliman as a vibrant and diverse academic community, a partner in nation-building, and one which plays a role of social critic through evidence-based scholarship and moral courage,” Nemenzo said.

Pandemic response

Barely two weeks into his term, however, he was confronted by the COVID-19 lockdowns. One of his first responses was the formation of a multidisciplinary task force which meets once a week to plan, implement, and update the University’s pandemic response. The administration provided accommodation to its frontliners, strengthened the University Health Service, and provided free testing and facilities for quarantine, testing, and vaccination.

“Today I am proud to say that we have put into practice what I had envisioned for UP in the context of the pandemic: to make our University an academic center of excellence providing an interdisciplinary hub that works with government, industry, and civil society in protecting the UP Diliman community and our people’s health,” Nemenzo said.

With the sudden shift to remote learning, UP Diliman strengthened its University Virtual Learning Environment, crafted guidelines, and conducted webinars to help the students and faculty cope. “We saw this as an opportunity to reimagine our classrooms and learning spaces as social laboratories to innovate and test new ideas mindful of the principles of inclusivity and compassion. . . . This remains an ongoing challenge,” Nemenzo pointed

Academic excellence

Beyond the pandemic, a major thrust of the UP Diliman administration is the strengthening of the General Education Program. It aims “to equip students with imaginative and critical faculties that will enable them to deal with complexity and change and provide them the cultural and ethical moorings in this fast-changing world”.

Nemenzo spoke of launching a tri-college PhD program for Data Science and Analytics; and of establishing a Data Commons, which is a computing hub, data repository, and archives to serve the entire UP System.

He also envisioned greater collaboration with other state universities and colleges in developing disciplines such as space engineering.

This year saw Southern Luzon and Metro Manila being hit with back-to-back crises, with the phreatomagmatic eruption of Taal Volcano in January and the COVID-19 pandemic in March. For the education sector, it meant multiple weeks-long class suspensions. While the institutions to which the panelists belonged had online learning systems in place, Chua said it best: “No one was prepared for this kind of lockdown.”

UPOU started shifting to online classes in 2001 and its classes were fully online by 2007, so Bandalaria said that the University initially assumed things would be business as usual. But she admitted the quarantine brought up issues beyond the usual open and distance e-learning operations. Anxiety, stress, accessibility, work-school scheduling, and health risks were some of the concerns raised by faculty, staff, and students alike."
From giant shipworms to biofuels – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/from-giant-shipworms-to-biofuels/,"From giant shipworms to biofuels
July 28, 2017 | Written by Jo. Florendo B. Lontoc



This giant which lived inside long crusty tubes under the sea had eluded scientists for a very long time, earning the title of “Loch Ness Monster of mollusks” in a New Yorker scientific feature. Little was known of the shipworm with the scientific name Kuphus polythalamia. All modern-day scientists had were the empty skeletal pipes turning up in different parts of the world, and pre-War specimens that had turned into mush.

Early scientists had established that it was descended from the wood-burrowing and wood-consuming shipworms that locals called tamilok, which live in mangrove wood and whose bodies are much softer and nowhere near the giant shipworm’s size which recorded a length of five feet.

It was only when a local show known to feature strange cuisine, Kapuso Mo Jessica Soho, broke the news in 2010 of people eating a strange creature for its meaty flesh and alleged curative powers that scientists got wind of where to look.A researcher in the Marine Natural Products Laboratory (MNPL) of the UP Marine Science Institute (MSI), Jem Lapitan, saw the video on TV and reported it to Dr. Gisela Concepcion, her supervisor, head of the MNPL and UP lead person in the project studying the tamilok and their symbiont bacteria, or bacteria in symbiotic relationship with them.

After confirming the existence of giant tamiloks in the area with research collaborators in Sultan Kudarat State University (SKSU), the UP researchers acted quickly. They braved the long flight to Sultan Kudarat, met their counterparts from SKSU led by Prof. Julie Albano, and endured a dangerous ride through risk areas to a coastal area where the giant tamilok were said to live.

Leading the team on the ground, Marvin Altamia, a research associate at the UP-MSI, already knew a lot about mollusks, especially tamilok. He conducts research for the Philippine Mollusk Symbiont International Cooperative Biodiversity Group (PMS-ICBG), which is led by marine microbiologist Margo Haygood of the University of Utah, and dr. Concepcion in UPMSI, in association with top scientists in marine microbiology, natural products chemistry, biochemistry, and evolutionary biology from the University of Utah, Drexel University’s Academy of Natural Sciences-Philadelphia, and Northeastern Eastern University’s Ocean Genome Legacy (OGL).

Shipworms fall under these experts’ study. A shipworm belongs to the family of bivalve mollusks. Its two shells have been reduced to two raspy teeth just before its mouth, used to gnaw at wood and burrow in it. Its body is host to several bacteria in symbiotic relationship with it. Bacteria are responsible for producing enzymes necessary to break down wood for ingestion by the shipworm. Cellulose which constitutes wood and other plant materials is quite indigestible without enzymes from bacteria.

Because of their symbiont bacteria, shipworms were the bane of ship hulls which were made of wood in the old days. They earned the reputation of being the termites of the sea.

Arriving at the marine lagoon in Sultan Kudarat, the researchers found it full of decaying matter, mostly forest debris from land. The sediment reeked of rotten eggs, the usual smell of hydrogen sulfide. They found the giant shipworms not growing in wood but buried in thick pitch-black muck three meters from the surface of the lagoon. It was easy to see how scientists had missed it.

A giant shipworm was brought to Gisela’s laboratory, where Dan Distel of OGL and Gisela’s research staff chipped at the bigger but closed end of the calcareous tube, creating an opening to slide off the creature from the tube onto the table. The animal easily fell into notoriety as a science fiction horror creature feature. The black slimy body resembles that of a worm from hell. Its “head” is all mouth with two “beaks” for lips and its tail ends with a pair of siphons and stalk-looking “pallets”.

But the researchers found that the “monster” was really immobile and could not possibly swallow creatures whole. It could hardly eat, its mouth being located awkwardly at the closed bottom of the pipe.

Knowing how shipworms and clams in general thrive on symbiosis with bacteria in their bodies, Marvin knew that a lot of questions about the newly found creature would be answered by looking at its symbiont bacteria. After having seen the strange habitat of the giant shipworm and its distance from solid wood, he knew they were off to discover a new set of bacteria.

Guided and assisted by Gisela and foreign collaborators, particularly Margo and Dan, who are the world’s experts on shipworms, Marvin and the MSI research team proceeded with experiments.

The team took out flesh from the gills and other organs and cultured microorganisms found in the specimen. Knowing the giant shipworm’s rotten-egg-smelling home, the team used a dish with a sulfuric medium, and was able to isolate sulfur-processing bacteria. They found this to be dominant in the shipworm’s gills. The team’s hunch about the giant shipworm’s “chemoautotrophy” (or more specifically, what is known as “sulfur- or thio-autotrophy”) was spot on.

The Marine Natural Products Laboratory crew of the UP Marine Science Institute headed by Dr. Gisela Concepcion (seated, middle). Shown are: (left to right, standing) MJ Cleofas, Meljune Chicote, Victor Chua, Jose Miguel Robes, Iris Bea Ramiro, Marvin Altamia, Jortan Tun, Jessa Laude, Albebson Lim, Miguel Azcuna, Noel Lacerna, Renheart De Leon, Oliver Belleza, and Melfeb Chicote; and (left to right, seated) Emma Handy, Neda Barghi, Carrissa Shipman, Dr. Concepcion, Dr. Lilibeth Salvador-Reyes, Myra Ruth Picart, Malem Flores, Irene Pamisan, and Eliza Belen.

Through complicated and high-technology processes, they characterized the bacteria, and found its enzyme to be indeed a catalyst in hydrogen sulfide oxidation. The team looked at the bacteria’s genome, and amplified the genes associated with the sulfur-processing enzyme.

The team had of course suspected sulfur-processing symbiont bacteria all along. And they knew that in hydrothermal vents under the sea, tubeworms and mussels are host to bacteria that utilize hydrogen sulfide being spewed from under the earth. In processing the sulfide using its enzymes, the bacteria produce energy which the host animals use to fix carbon into organic compounds, which in turn nourish the host animals.

Hydrogen sulfide is the same compound produced by decaying organic matters in the sea. “It often results from the microbial breakdown of organic matter in the absence of oxygen gas, such as in swamps and sewers,” Gisela explains. “The lagoon was oxygen-less. Why? Trees, wood, and leaves fell to the lagoon and were broken down by microbes. Microbes consume oxygen as they break up organic matter.”

The muck in the lagoon contains broken-down, decaying pieces of wood.

In later tests, the team found bacteria from the shipworm and the hydrothermal mussels arranging themselves into a cluster, a behavior exhibited only by bacteria of the same family. This confirmed his suspicions relating the creatures at the coast to those in the ocean trenches.

With the findings, the PMS-ICBG proved that somehow during its evolution, the shipworm emerged from wood, and favored bacteria that process sulfur, which is abundant in the sea. Having discovered new symbionts to aid in its nourishment, the shipworm thrived in the harsh, oxygen-lacking environment of seabeds, not needing to devour food, but only growing a calcareous tube to protect its fragile body. Growing into a gigantic size, it was able to harbor more bacteria particularly in its overgrown gills, while its digestive system shrank to insignificance.

This family of bacteria was harnessed by the mussels and tubeworms (which are real worms) so that they could survive in and populate the deeper part of the sea, near boiling hydrothermal vents, where no living creature was expected to survive.

This discovery thus contributes to the study of evolution and to learning how life forms spread and survive between land and the deep blue sea, extending the “wooden-steps” theory. The details have been published by the prestigious Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in a paper by Dan Distel et al. (www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1620470114).

But the study of the giant shipworm is also significant for the study of biofuels, which is a major component of the PMS-ICBG project. Enzymes used by cellulose-processing bacteria to break down wood to something digestible by animals for their energy needs, are prime candidates for producing biofuels out of abundant organic matter, e.g., waste materials from major crops, mostly constituted by cellulose. Could enzymes from the symbiont bacteria of giant shipworms, thriving on rotting matter, also be used to derive fuels?"
UP to continue providing teaching enhancement and academic support grants – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/up-to-continue-providing-teaching-enhancement-and-academic-support-grants/,"


The University of the Philippines (UP) administration will continue providing teaching enhancement and academic support grants for UP faculty, REPS (research, extension, and professional staff), administrative employees, and one-time device support for the first semester of AY 2021-2022.

This continuing grant of teaching enhancement and academic support was announced in a memo, Memorandum No. PDLC 21-19, released on October 22. According to the memo, courses will continue to be delivered remotely in the first semester of the academic year, just as they have been during the previous academic year. Alternative work arrangements for administrative staff and REPS will remain in effect for the same period, in light of the continuing community quarantine and the logistical constraints to mass vaccination and the achievement of herd immunity in the country against the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its variants.

The University, however, is preparing to transition to blended teaching and learning by the second semester of AY 2021-2022 and to new forms of alternative work arrangements in the next normal of living and working with the pandemic and other disruptions.

 

The guidelines for the grant of teaching enhancement and academic support and one-time device support are as follows:

Resilience begins at home – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/resilience-begins-at-home/,"


Mandated to advance national development and also to help save people’s lives, the University of the Philippines established the UP Resilience Institute (RI) in July 2016, followed by its adoption of the Nationwide Operational Assessment of Hazards (NOAH) Center in March 2017 as its core component.

By harnessing the expertise of academics and professionals in the fields of science and technology as well as the arts and humanities, these UP hubs are at the forefront of scientific research and extension work on natural hazards, climate change actions, disaster risk reduction (DRR), and the promotion of disaster resilience in the Philippines and the Pacific Rim.

The Philippines is one of the most disaster-prone nations in the world, and minding its many tantrums is the unenviable but vital job of UP’s top disaster scientist, Dr. Alfredo Mahar Francisco A. Lagmay. A faculty member of the UP National Institute of Geological Sciences (NIGS), Lagmay also concurrently heads the RI and the NOAH Center.

Dr. Lagmay obtained his bachelor’s and master’s degrees from UP and holds a PhD degree in Earth Sciences from the University of Cambridge. He is also an Academician of the National Academy of Science and Technology (NAST).

Our own backyard

One of the first projects of the RI and the NOAH Center aims to make all UP campuses and communities around the country resilient to climate change and geared for long-term development.

Lagmay explains that UP “must first do it in our own backyard, if we are to get all municipalities to prepare and plan ahead. We can’t preach what we don’t practice. The first step is to do the resilient campuses project so that it can be a model for campuses in the Philippines.” He says that the project uses climate change projections prescribed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a scientific and intergovernmental body under the United Nations.

“We have to translate the projections of climate change into hazard maps that can be used by the UP campuses to plan ahead and to develop. Before we do it for the entire Philippines, we must do it in our backyard first. I’m not saying the campuses are not planned. I’m saying that campuses need to be more resilient and adaptive to the climate change impacts, building resilience, which is relatively a new concept,” Lagmay says.

Probabilistic hazard maps

According to Lagmay, the RI and NOAH have many projects lined up, aside from the resilient UP campuses project. Among these are the completion of climate flood maps for the entire Philippines for the years 2049-2079, and the landslide maps for 2049-2079, based on the representative concentration pathways 4.5 and 8.5 as prescribed by the IPCC.

“We also are producing storm surge hazard maps with climate change projections. Basically, these are multi-scenario, multi-hazard maps. Collectively, they’re called probabilistic hazard maps that get us to understand better the risks involved in planning against hazard impacts. We also have a project on detecting CO2 using low-cost UV cameras, and another on solid waste management,” Lagmay adds.

“We are also proposing to study the interaction of the seas, land, and atmosphere. Because here in the Philippines and in other tropical areas, as well as areas near the equator, it’s very hard to predict weather, and largely that may be due to unknown factors related to the interaction of the sea, ocean, land and atmosphere. That needs to be understood,” he emphasizes.

Dr. Lagmay says that Senator Loren Lagarda wanted the UP Resilience Institute “to lead all the state universities and colleges in helping the Climate Change Commission get the local government units to complete their local climate change action plans.”

Meet the giant clam fam – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/meet-the-giant-clam-fam/,"Meet the giant clam fam
June 22, 2018 | Written by Stephanie Cabigao



It is impossible to miss those electric colors—shifting from olive green to brown or dark green to violet; those shining in brilliant shades of blue and green; or the ones freckling in mixed colors of yellow, green, and brown; and especially those looking regal in mottled patterns of yellow-brown, green or gray—when passing through the waters of Silaqui Island in Bolinao, Pangasinan. Their luminescence is matched by their gigantic size, which make them the darling giants of the North.

There are nine extant species of giant clams. Seven of these are found in the Philippines, four of which are home to University of the Philippines Marine Science Institute-Bolinao Marine Laboratory (BML). These giant clams are being cultured both at its onshore hatchery and ocean nursery.

Giant clam fam

The bands of olive green to brown or dark-green to violet clams are the Tridacna gigas, more commonly known as the true giant clams, because adults have such immense shells. In the Philippines, they’re called taklobo, a term which applies to most giant clam species, according to administrative aide Julio Curiano Jr. Particularly, these species of T. gigas are locally called bukà, with reference to the clam’s gaping habit, Curiano adds.

Hagdan-hagdan, the Filipino name for Tridacna squamosa, is the type of giant clam in mottled patterns of mixed yellow, green, and brown. Those in brilliant shades of blue and green in linear patterns are called Tridacna derasas. Another member of the BML’s clam fam is the Hippopus hippopus, locally called kukong-kabayo, in mottled patterns of yellow-brown, green, or gray.

The magnificent colors that these species produce are part of a process of symbiosis. Curiano explains that giant clams are symbiotic with zooxanthellae, particularly Symbiodinium microadriaticum. “Zooxanthellae are dinoflagellates that live within the clam’s mantle, where they are able to photosynthesize, reproduce, and grow in large numbers,” Curiano says. He adds that the presence of giant clams makes the ocean conducive for various fish species to reproduce, making it rich and abundant.

Giant clams are protandrous, meaning, they begin life as males. Curiano describes how these species are male from zero to seven years old. Thereafter, they are able to release both sperm and egg. He theorizes that since giant clams are sessile creatures—or fixed in one place—they have adapted to become hermaphrodites for their survival. The highest egg production recorded by the Marine Science Institute was 105 million eggs from a 61-cm clam.

However, giant clams are cultured at the BML in a different way from their natural spawning. Curiano says that his team takes 20 giant clams from various cohorts during the spawning phase. “We do away with inbreeding because it has a lesser chance of survival,” he adds.

 

The oldest and the largest

Curiano is a fisheries graduate from Samar. It was only through a job advertisement in a daily newspaper that he learned about giant clams when the BML opened its research aide post. He immediately applied for the post, and soon after, he was seeing these huge clams for the first time in 2006.

He recalls that it was in 1983 when Dr. Edgardo Gomez, in collaboration with Dr. Angel Alcala, surveyed the waters off Bolinao, and eventually discovered the depletion of the giant clams there. That same year, they acquired three juvenile giant clams all the way from the Solomon Islands. Since 1985, the BML has been able to increase the number of giant clams, as well as to distribute them to as far as the United Kingdom and Germany.

Two of the three giant clam pioneers from the Solomon Islands are still alive today, with a massive size of 98.3 centimeters, the largest giant clams recorded in the country. BML also holds the biggest kukong-kabayo (Hippopus hippopus) at 90.3 centimeters, with T. derasa growing as large as 93.6 centimeters; and hagdan-hagdan at 87.6 centimeters. These gentle giants have a lifespan of 50 to 60 years, according to Curiano.

Going beyond the Summit – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/going-beyond-the-summit/,"

“Life begins kapag hindi ka na nag-iinarte,” so the UP Mountaineers say. What could this actually mean for the longest running mountaineering organization in the country?

Its forty years tell us how UP Mountaineers pioneered and sustained mountaineering as a consequential sport. More importantly, it showed how mountaineering is not just about literally reaching the summit, but going beyond it.

 

Mountaineering as a sport

Since 1977, the UP Mountaineers have counted over a thousand professionals and students as members, as the open organization has welcomed individuals in and outside the UP community. Its strength lies in its observance of two basic rules—punctuality and participation.

UP Mountaineers President Ed Magdaluyo defines mountaineering thus: “Primarily, like any other kind of sport, it requires one to be physically fit. In fact, during the application period, applicants go through a physical fitness program, which is later applied to levels of climb activities before attaining membership status. It’s also about setting the right attitude while performing those tedious physical activities,” the UP Mountaineer Batch 2013 adds.

UP Mountaineer Batch 2016 Donna Padilla emphasizes attitude and mental fitness as very important qualities to possess as a mountaineer. “Like any other sport, mountaineering requires a holistic kind of preparedness, which means equipping oneself with physical strength as well as mental toughness.”

“To those who are wondering, mountaineering is not an expensive sport. As long as you have a good pair of hiking shoes and proper clothing gear, you’re all set,” says Magdaluyo. “Other hiking gear is shared, especially among UP Mountaineers,” Padilla adds.

 

Superlative mountaineering

Magdaluyo, an associate professor at the Department of Mining, Metallurgical, and Materials at the College of Engineering, says that mountaineering is a multisport.

“We have developed various physical fitness trainings and programs necessary for every climb we take. In turn, this exposure to high impact physical fitness, such as running and swimming, has turned members into trail runners, rock climbers, bikers, even triathletes.”

“I have been joining small groups of mountaineers in several hiking activities. But only when I signed up for the UP Mountaineers did I change how I value my every climb. It taught me to not only think about myself, but also to consider the surroundings, to become responsible in general,” College of Home Economics Food Technology major Padilla shares.

Of course, Romy Garduce’s Mt. Everest climb is one of the many shining moments of the UP Mountaineers, according to Magdaluyo. Besides that, the organization also takes pride in its unrivaled expertise in opening up new and emerging trails.

Always practice the Leave No Trace Principle

 

Padilla and Magdaluyo also mention the mountaineering training programs that the organization has developed over years of hiking experience, from basic mountaineering courses to outdoor life support, and crisis and rescue response.

The recent success of the Akyat Convention held last May 18-19 with over 300 participants in attendance was a gratifying moment for these members. Magdaluyo describes this year’s convention theme—transformative learning beyond mountaineering—as a platform that provided discussions on pressing issues in four identified areas such as biodiversity, the digital age, ecotourism policies, and practices from various mountain terrains.

While the UP Mountaineers have achieved these milestones, there are also moments in its history that remind them of constant struggle, even the inevitability of death."
Film Scores Music to Your Eyes – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/film-scores-music-to-your-eyes/,"


How did Shake, Rattle and Roll ever become a hit in 1984, and eventually one of Philippine cinema’s great movie franchises? How did its trilogy—Spirit-of-the-Glass, Frigidaire, and the Manananggal—define the Filipino’s collective memory of horror?

How did scenes in the film Heneral Luna rekindle our patriotic and nationalistic sensibilities? Or how did a line in the song “Bituing Walang Ningning” draw the Filipino audience to that showdown moment between Dorina and Lavinia in the movie of the same title?

Most moviegoers probably don’t know it, but it’s the music that gives depth to cinematic storytelling. It is essential to keeping the imaginative work afloat and to transforming dialogue and words into a field of image and sound.

Musical scoring may be underrated compared to directing, acting, and scriptwriting. But two of UP’s talents are at it in today’s Philippine cinema, and are paving the way for the bright future of musical scoring in the country.

 


TOFARM’s Best Musical Score for the film Tanabata’s Wife (2018)

 

Composing for the screen

UP Fine Arts alumni May-I Guia Padilla and Diwa de Leon have become staple names in the music scoring industry. It may be a puzzle how they wound up as music composers, given their visual arts backgrounds. But Padilla and de Leon both attribute their success to passion and a combination of talent and networking.

Both admit to initially hardly knowing anyone in the film industry. They started out small. Their first clients were film students who were also composing for radio and television, but whose works sometimes didn’t get to air.

With 30 original compositions, May-I Guia Padilla started composing at the young age of six. This year marks his breakthrough in the industry. “My major break in musical scoring is winning TOFARM’s Best Musical Score for the film Tanabata’s Wife. The goal was to compose a theme that moviegoers would leave the cinema singing, along with the film’s theme song. I feel that we have succeeded. This is our first win, and hopefully not the last.”

“We were also able to create a theme for every character in the film, which is not common in mainstream cinema. No offense, but theme songs are still seldom composed in mainstream movies today,” Padilla adds.

For Diwa de Leon, it was when he first saw Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, and heard John Williams’ wonderful score in Betamax format as a child in the 1980s that implanted in him the idea of someday becoming a film composer.

“Health is a very difficult agenda. In local politics today, no one will believe you when you define health as a campaign issue by giving out ‘free’ PhilHealth. That era is over. There are a lot of health issues that can be solved without doctors and just by governance,” says Del Carmen’s man of action, Mayor Alfredo M. Coro II.

What drove this UP Los Baños Computer Science alumnus, with a graduate degree in Technology Management from UP Diliman and years of ThinkPad technologies experience, to turn the sleepy town of Del Carmen on the island of Siargao in Surigao Del Norte into a dynamic municipality that leads the country in health management?

For Coro, being a native of Del Carmen and at the same time an Isko immersed in public service was always a reason to come back. It was in 2009 when he was called to run for public office. It was an opportunity for him to apply his IT systems background to good governance, especially for something as abstract as health.

 

Health as a framework for governance

Del Carmen consists of four island barangays, nine coastal barangays, an upland barangay, and six inland barangays. It is the largest town on Siargao Island, with a population of about 20,000, mostly farmers, fisherfolk, senior citizens, government employees, and students. “We have the airport, the sea port and the state college. I have a city problem in a 5th class community,” Mayor Coro points out.

He looks at the town’s pressing issues as a matter of health. “By focusing on health, we are also able to address other issues in food security, environment, poverty, social and economic activities,” Coro says.

“At first, we had no data. There was nothing until we started documenting things from one barangay to another,” he recounts. “The concept is for you to understand the complexity of health systems and develop a complex solution to the complex problem. And then, I heard about a health governance program conducted by Zuellig. I persevered and insisted and that our town be included in its two-year program in bridging leadership,” he continues.

He confesses that he had no idea what exactly to do until he took the second phase of the module where he was able to see the uniqueness of Del Carmen’s geography and its situation. The challenge was how to cascade a health system to a municipality that had varied concerns, needs, and physical and cultural characteristics for every barangay.

“That’s when we started looking into a health program with problems that even the LGU is part of. I myself had this idea that health was the doctor’s concern. But then we realized that there are so many health issues that are matters of governance,” he emphasizes.

 

The SOHG experience

The mayor, together with the MHO and RHU staff, developed a health governance program to list all the Department of Health (DOH) programs and local initiatives needed to address the priority health targets. “We have a barangay that has a high incidence of teenage pregnancy, others have zero. We have barangays that has Schistosomiasis, while others don’t. Given the varied situations, we cannot use a generic approach. We can address the health issue by finding a solution unique to every barangay,” he says.

Mayor Coro also stresses, “You can never be there for everyone. So, you have to capacitate the barangay leaders in identifying their concerns and how to develop their own innovations in addressing their concerns.”

The Seal of Health Governance (SOHG) is simply a monitoring tool. It has a systems-thinking application to governance in the barangay level. There may be unique and individual health concerns in every barangay; however, there is still a common metric being monitored as non-negotiables, such as maternal deaths, immunization, and infant mortalities, formulated by the collective efforts of the LGU, midwives of BHWs, nurses, and barangay captains.

“As a barangay leader, you must be able to quantify how ‘healthy’ your barangay is, and this is expressed through this tool. After being able to establish this tool, we rolled out rewards and incentives. We launched the first set of awards in 2013 during the town’s fiesta. Out of 20 barangays, only 10 participated. The successful outcomes and reports from 2013 have encouraged a 100 percent participation in 2014,” Mayor Coro proudly says.

The lack of toilet bowls in Barangay Antipolo led the community to innovate its own locally made urinals. Another barangay zoomed in on clean and green. Meanwhile, one barangay was the first to set up a community-based drug rehabilitation program. “This is not yet in the books,” Mayor Coro says. “As soon as President Duterte declared the war on drugs, we immediately declared drugs a health issue. We asked the help of the UP Manila Community Medicine in teaching us, the LGU and the barangays in solving drug-related problems without anyone dying or getting into jail. We were able to prove it in just three months. No tokhang. We saw that it was possible, so we set it up in other barangays,” he continues.

 

Health wonders

Since health management is continuously improving in this side of the country, community health workers now have the opportunity to visit bedridden patients in their homes. They are also implementing the “white uniform visibility,” which means nurses are set to go to barangays on a daily basis. “We have senior citizens who only got to see a doctor for the first time. The behavior of the people of Del Carmen has greatly changed towards health,” Mayor Coro says."

The University of the Philippines is the country’s national university—the home of thinkers who help shape the nation. It is also a compassionate and nurturing University committed to honor and excellence. The University environment has always been a welcoming place, a place to turn to for refuge, healing, and enrichment. Here is a look at the University as a haven, a sanctuary of and for the people.

 

UP Baguio: Quads, commons, hubs

The UP Baguio Campus Masterplan (February, 2018) is based on three major principles: 1) respect for nature and society; 2) ensuring long-term sustainable campus development; and 3) linking education to a “living laboratory” for sustainability.

The future quads, commons as well as cultural and learning hubs within its forest reserves are spaces that encourage movement, interaction, and productivity. “These address the issue of pedestrian and vehicular conflicts. The recreation particularly of the main quad from a parking lot into a central open space will provide a new circulation and gathering space for students on campus,” says the proposed campus plan.

 

UP Diliman: Peace sanctuary

UP Diliman is home to various academic and public activities. It also provides a public space for its local constituents as well as a peace sanctuary.

In 2017, UP Diliman and the Mindanao Interfaith Services Foundation Inc. (MISFI) entered into an agreement in “developing curricula in the University and MISFI recognizing the vital contributions of indigenous communities, the Moro and peoples of Mindanao to national development and nationhood, forming advocacy campaigns on defense of the rights of indigenous communities, the Moro and peoples of Mindanao among others,” according to Rius Valle, spokesperson of Save Our Schools (SOS) Network-Mindanao.

MISFI is a network of 32 schools, offering basic and secondary education from preschool to junior high school in Regions 10, 11, 12 and 13, with the majority of its students coming from long-neglected lumad and Moro communities.

“The Save Our Schools (SOS) UP Diliman has launched a campaign of geotagging communities, schools, institutions, groups and individuals that have been named or have declared themselves as Peace Sanctuaries for the children of the lumad or the indigenous peoples in Mindanao. Geotagging means adding geographical information to digital image, data and social media applications. The campaign works by encouraging individuals, organizations, schools, colleges, units and institutions to declare spaces and communities as a refuge or sanctuaries for lumad children who are displaced or threatened by the ongoing martial law in Mindanao,” UPD Professor and spokesperson of Save Our Schools (SOS) Network-Diliman Sharon Briones explained.

 

UP Manila-PGH: Haven of hope and healing

The UP Manila-PGH Department of Pediatrics is a hub for collaborative and interdisciplinary research in health research. It has launched infrastructure projects prioritizing the delivery of quality patient care as well as providing an environment for recovery and healing. Among these projects is the Teddy Rey Healing Garden, which is an outdoor facility for pediatric patients as well as those with chronic illnesses and their caregivers. Right in the middle of the garden is the Dr. Artemio Jongco Gazebo, where patient-students of Silahis ng Kalusugan and their relatives gather after classes.

The Silahis ng Kalusugan is a school for the chronically ill. “The school was founded by Dr. Perla Santos Ocampo on September 23, 1996 and remains the only one of its kind in the Philippines. She was then the chair of the Department of Pediatrics when she convinced a special education teacher from the Division of City Schools, Manila, Estelita Samson, to hold classes for admitted patients,” Emma Alesna-Llanto wrote in a recent article.

 

UP Los Baños: Premium on life

The College of Human Ecology (CHE) puts a premium on life and the whole cycle of human development. As an institution, CHE addresses the family and community concerns in terms of age and psychosocial conditions.

A report by Mary Franhet Esperidion, Daisy V. Pelegrina, and Mark Jayson E. Gloria notes that “CHE has helped children and the elderly. Indeed, human development is business that concerns everybody and should be everybody’s concern as well. And CHE, with its commitment to understand all its complexities, is helping the helpless through their vulnerabilities.”

The Child Development Laboratory (CDL) teaches children to socialize through play. The Playshop promotes learning and friendships, and facilitates conscious parenting through play. CHE is also the first institution in the country to draw its attention to the elderly with the UPLB Elderly Development Program (UPLB EDP) by providing health and wellness services to senior citizens in nearby communities.

 

UP Visayas: A safe campus

“The UP Visayas Miag-ao campus has always been a safe place for its students, faculty and staff since it opened its doors to the public in 1989. One can still sleep with one’s doors unlocked at night although this is not encouraged,” Chair of the UPV Healthy Lifestyle and Wellness Committee Mary Lyncen M. Fernandez says."

May 31, 2019 | Written by Fred Dabu



A vending machine for non-prescription drugs and other over-the-counter products; a device that helps lifeguards detect drowning victims; and a tracking system for Alzheimer’s patients.

These were among the innovative products showcased at the 21st anniversary conference of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-University of the Philippines Manila (UP Manila) on February 28 at the Bayanihan Center, UNILAB Inc. complex, Pasig City.

With the theme, “Lab to Life: Translating Health Research for Filipinos,” the day-long conference included presentations and a poster exhibit of abstracts on these “future products” as laboratory-tested solutions that can be made commercially viable and available for development with prospective industrial partners.

Among the other technologies and plant-based products featured by the NIH were: virtual reality applications for phobia therapies; electronic medical record systems; and medicines derived from Tsaang gubat, Ulasimang bato, Yerba buena, and Akapulko herbs.

OTC Express

Research by members of the Adamson University’s Electronics Engineering Department features the OTC Express, a “microprocessor and microcontroller-based automated vending machine that monitors sales, transaction records, and product inventory remotely through a database.” According to the proponents of this innovation, the vending machine aims to dispense non-prescription medicines and toiletries, or over the counter (OTC) products, that are commonly purchased from drugstores. This makes commerce more convenient for both customers and operators. Customers will be able to save time since the machine allows flexible payments in coins, bills, and points earned through purchases using magnetic stripe cards; and they do not have to queue up at the cashier. On the other hand, operators can easily monitor products with the machine’s proximity sensors; and inventories are reported to them in real time, making restocking easier and eliminating periodic manual inspections.

Drowning Detection System

Another technology being offered by the Adamson EE department is a system for detecting body movements indicative of drowning. Proponents of this study cited drowning as one of the top causes of accidental deaths worldwide. Thus, to help lifeguards prevent drowning, they conceptualized the development of a wearable device and alarm system. According to the researchers, “there are specific near-drowning body movement patterns that could be detected and assessed.” The project shows the feasibility of developing a wearable device that detetcs an instinctive drowning response in the user using motion detection, and a receiving device that makes the system “capable of sensing, communicating, comparing and initiating an alarm”.

Tracking System for Patients with Alzheimer’s Disease

Also from the Adamson University, a research project proposes “the development of a real-time tracking system for patients with Alzheimer’s disease.” Proponents of this study designed a wearable tracking device for patients in nursing homes. The tracking device is linked to a personal computer-based software application that notifies administrators or caregivers if a patient has wandered out of the facility. Using wireless GSM technology, the system “will be able to locate the exact position of the patient,” and can even interconnect the patients’ individual devices through mesh network data transfers among their wearable devices. The researchers cited data from the National Statistics Office  indicating that, as of 2007, there were 3.6 million persons aged 65 and above, majority (56.8%) of them women, with Alzheimer’s disease. They are the main beneficiaries of this product.

The following innovations are currently handled by the UP Manila-Technology Transfer and Business Development Office (UPM-TTBDO):

YANIG: A Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy for Earthquake-related PTSD

The UPM-TTBDO describes YANIG as “a virtual reality application designed as an alternative way of exposing patients with earthquake-related post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to their stressors.” This application for Android mobile devices can simulate earthquakes with intensity levels ranging from 4 to 10 and allows the therapist to customize the parameters of the virtual environment and auditory cues to settings that are appropriate to the patient’s conditions.

VRETA: Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy for Agoraphobia 

VRETA is an application designed to supplement treatment for patients with Agoraphobia, the irrational fear of being in open or public spaces.  According to the proponents, the program provides “exposure therapy” using virtual environments, reduces the time and cost of finding a suitable public place, and can generate a progress report after each simulation. It also protects the person’s privacy. The website of the Mayo Clinic describes Agoraphobia as a type of anxiety disorder in which the patient fears and avoids places or situations that might cause him or her to panic and make the patient feel trapped, helpless or embarrassed. The patient fears an actual or anticipated situation, such as using public transportation, being in open or enclosed spaces, standing in line, or being in a crowd. It is also “one of the most disabling phobias and one of the most challenging to treat”.

AVRET: Acrophobia Virtual Reality Exposure Treatment

AVRET is a program designed to help therapists treat patients with fear of heights. Like the YANIG and VRETA applications, AVRET provides a virtual environment that the therapist can customize for the patients, allow more privacy and less costs, minimize the risks posed by the outdoors, and generate progress reports after each simulation.

RxBox and CHITS

“RxBox is a multi-component program designed to provide better access to life-saving health services in isolated and disadvantaged communities nationwide.” It includes the continuous development of “a biomedical device, the Community Health Information Tracking System (CHITS—a pioneering electronic medical record system) and telemedicine, and their integration and eHealth training of rural health professionals”.  Around 160 government primary care facilities use RxBox. CHITS is a secure and interoperable EMR capable of transmitting electronic reports to the Department of Health (DOH) and the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth). Around 180 public health centers are using CHITS.

My most memorable PE subject was swimming. I learned I was quite good at it. All throughout my high school days, I had poor eye-hand coordination (table tennis, badminton) and was very poor at team sports (volleyball, basketball). But in swimming, neither was required. All I needed was to be comfortable in the water and make it to several laps. It was an excellent full body workout for my wiry frame and improved my lung capacity.

In commemoration of the September 21 anniversary of the declaration of Marcos’s Martial Law, the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) paid tribute to the heroes and victims who fought the dictatorship. Dubbed “Never Again, Never Forget: A day of remembrance for democracy and freedom”, the event was held on September 21, 2018 at the CHR building in UP Diliman, Quezon City, and highlighted “the recognition of the victims of human rights violations under the Marcos regime who, with their sacrifices and heroism, helped the country restore its democracy”.

In addition to the thousands of claimants already approved for monetary reparations by the former Human Rights Victims’ Claims Board (HRVCB), another 125 cases were determined motu proprio by the board. The said honorees who chose to forego reparations were prominent leaders, activists and human rights advocates who will be included among the thousands to be memorialized in an archive, a museum, and a wall of remembrance. The CHR presented certificates of recognition to the following honorees or their representatives: Jacobo S.

UP and Barangay Krus Na Ligas: Intersections of History – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/up-and-barangay-krus-na-ligas-intersections-of-history/,"


A land dispute that hundreds of years, a revolution and a world war failed to resolve has apparently been settled by the stroke of a pen. Long-time residents of Krus Na Ligas, once regarded as “illegal settlers’’ on property owned by the University of the Philippines in Diliman, Quezon City, will soon become rightful owners of the land that their ancestors had occupied long before the city or the university even existed.

Last month, Republic Act No. 11454 was signed into law authorizing UP to sell 22.467 hectares of land in Barangay Krus Na Ligas to the Quezon City government. This marks a significant turning point in a decades’ long dispute between the UP Diliman campus and Krus Na Ligas, a community adjacent to the university whose history goes back hundreds of years, and whose life today is distinct from yet intertwined with the national university’s flagship campus.

 

The Katipunan and the village of the cross-shaped ligas tree

According to various accounts, what is now Krus Na Ligas was once a large forested area west of Marikina surrounded by high hills; the people of Marikina simply called the area “Bundok.” Around the year 1700, some 30 families, who were until then living in a part of Marikina now known as Barangay Tanyong, migrated to the area to live off the land as farmers. These families bore such names such Tiburcio, Salvador, Cruz, Santos, Baluyot, Francisco, and Fulgencio. The community, which was under the territory of Marikina, became known as “Gulod,” and in time the farmlands of the settlers covered around 2,000 hectares. The residents erected a chapel made of bamboo and cogon, and built their homes around it.

How did it get its name Krus Na Ligas? Back in the Spanish period, according to one account, a Spanish soldier on a hunting expedition in the area asked a local what the name of the place was. The local thought the Spaniard was asking about the name of the tree he was pointing at. The tree in question, a ligas tree, was growing in a cross formation and considered sacred, so the local answered “Krus Na Ligas.”

An ancestor of this tree, whose branches grew in a cross formation, became the source and inspiration for the name of the community.

The community played an important role during the onset of the Philippine revolution in August 1896. Andres Bonifacio, founder of the Katipunan and regarded as the Father of the Philippine Revolution, is said to have established Krus Na Ligas and nearby Balara as a fortress or defensible site due to their strategic location.

An account by Atoy M. Navarro and Raymund Arthur Abejo published by the National Research Council of the Philippines and UP, said that on August 26, 1896, three days after the August 23 Cry of Pugad-lawin/Balintawak, a battle between the Spanish forces and the Katipuneros took place near Pasong Tamo. Afterward, Bonifacio and other Katipuneros retreated to Balara and Krus Na Ligas, then known as Gulod, to rest, eat and take shelter from the rain. Among those present, aside from Bonifacio, were Emilio Jacinto, Aguedo del Rosario, Enrique Pacheco, Cipriano Pacheco, Alfonso Pacheco, and possibly Guillermo Masangkay and Pio Valenzuela.

Katipuneros were said to have rested at a spot known as Hangyang Gipit, which was a path between two large hills in the area now known as Maginhawa Street in Teacher’s Village. The Katipuneros also stayed at a house in front of the church and the plaza. Bonifacio and the others used the time to plan their next moves in preparation for their August 29 attack on Manila, ultimately deciding to head to Malanday and Barangka in Marikina.

A hundred years later, a marker was installed on the façade of the old church of Krus Na Ligas by UP to commemorate the role that Krus Na Ligas played in Philippine history.

 

Titles of land and Spanish nobility

Another side of the Krus Na Ligas story begins with a Chinese trader from Binondo named Son Tua, who prospered from the galleon trade. Son Tua, who changed his name to Don Antonio Maria Tuason, led and organized the Battalion of the Royal Prince against the British forces that occupied Manila from 1762 to 1764 to prove his loyalty to Spain. As a reward, King Carlos III of Spain elevated the family to Spanish nobility, and awarded Don Tuason a large encomienda, a land grant which comprised vast areas of what is now Quezon City and the Marikina Valley.

Before his death in 1775, Don Antonio Tuason founded a mayorazgo or noble estate, and his eldest son, Don Vicente Dolores Tuason, became the first holder of the mayorazgo. Don Vicente soon acquired the Jesuit Hacienda de San Isidro de Mariquina, as well as the Hacienda de Maysilo in Tambobon (now Malabon). With the Hacienda de Nagtajan bought by his sister in Pandacan, and Don Vicente’s purchase of the Hacienda de Sta. Mesa formerly belonging to the Real Mesa de la Santa Misericordia and which included Sitio Diliman, the Tuasons became owners of four vast haciendas contiguous to one another.

The Tuasons managed to hold onto their mayorazgo until the 1890s. The Americans, however, did not recognize the concept of a noble estate. On May 3, 1914, the Tuasons registered their title to the land on the Mariquina Estate, which included Krus Na Ligas, at the Office of the Register of Deeds. Although Krus Na Ligas accounts indicate that on March 25, 1877, the Tiburcio family was granted a Titulo Posesorio to the land they lived on by the Spanish government, the Supreme Court in 1967 declared the family’s title invalid in favor of the Tuason title. The Tuason family eventually sold the title to the People’s Homesite and Housing Corporation (PHHC) and to UP.

UP and the rise of President Quezon’s dream city

The University of the Philippines, founded in 1908, soon outgrew its original site in Manila. In 1935, plans for UP’s relocation to a larger site gained traction when Manuel L. Quezon, then the Senate president, became the first Commonwealth president. On December 14, 1937, President Quezon created the Committee on Education Policy to study UP’s relocation.

UP’s relocation meshed well with President Quezon’s dream of improving the living conditions of laborers and low-salaried employees, and to create a new city to replace Manila as the Philippines’ capital. To achieve this dream, Quezon created the People’s Homesite Corporation, the first government housing agency, which was a subsidiary of the National Development Corporation. In October 1938, the Board of Directors of the PHC approved a resolution to purchase “a tract of land consisting of 15,723,191 square meters” from the Diliman Estate of the Tuason Family, at five centavos per square meter. The Tuasons donated an additional 493 hectares to serve as UP’s new site.

President Quezon urged the National Assembly to legislate UP’s relocation. On June 3, 1939, the Assembly enacted Commonwealth Act No. 442, allowing the UP Board of Regents to proceed with UP’s relocation.

At the time, Krus Na Ligas was one of the rural barrios in the Diliman Estate, which also included Culiat, Balara, Pansol, Barangka, Quirino, Mahabang Gubat and Bago Bantay. When UP acquired the site and delineated the Diliman campus, it included within its boundaries a number of these barrios.

 

The parallel rise of UP, Quezon City and Krus Na Ligas

The Krus Na Ligas community gradually grew. In 1940, the Krus Na Ligas Elementary School was founded as an annex of the Balara Elementary School. In its first year, the school handled a first-grade class of 26 students. Without a school building, classes were held in the house of a Krus Na Ligas resident. According to Krus Na Ligas accounts, by 1948-1949 a census found that there were 163 families and a total of 815 people, including children, living in the barrio.

The war devastated UP’s Manila campus, giving greater impetus for UP’s relocation. On July 17, 1948, President Elpidio Quirino signed Republic Act No. 333 amending Commonwealth Act No. 502, “An Act to Establish the Capital of the Philippines and the Permanent Seat of the National Government.” RA No. 333 authorized the Capital City Planning Commission to purchase all private estates in the delineated land, including the Diliman Estate. The full relocation of UP to Diliman was accomplished from December 16, 1948 to January 11, 1949, and on January 12, UP formally began classes on its new campus. In February 1949, UP celebrated its 40th anniversary with the transfer of the Oblation from Manila to Diliman.

According to the official monthly review of President Elpidio Quirino published in the Official Gazette, the President signed on March 1, 1949 the deed of sale transferring the eight parcels of land in the Mariquina estate now occupied by UP to the UP BOR. A token sum of one peso was paid by UP to the Philippine government.

The relocation of the campus to the Diliman site was a turning-point for Krus Na Ligas. Some residents found work in the new campus doing laundry or selling produce to campus residents. On the other hand, construction in the campus and in the housing projects in Quezon City brought in an influx of workers who settled in the nearby rural communities, including Krus Na Ligas and Old Balara. In 1951, a temporary school building was set up in Krus Na Ligas; in 1955, a regular health center was also constructed. In 1961, the first school building for the Krus Na Ligas Elementary School was built.

Push and pull between UP and Krus Na Ligas

There have been conflicting claims over ownership of the lands covered by Krus Na Ligas and UP for decades. Families residing in Krus Na Ligas contested the Tuason family’s titles over the lands, which according to them put the legitimacy of the transfer of ownership of the lands to the PHHC and UP into question.

On August 16, 1967, in GR No. L-24114, the Supreme Court upheld the validity of the Transfer Certificate of Title 9462 and 1356 in the names of UP and the PHHC, which the Tiburcio family of Krus Na Ligas had challenged. Previously, the same court stated that the degree of registration issued in 1914 under the Torrens system to the Tuasons, who were the predecessors-in-interest to UP and the PHHC, became incontrovertible after one year. The question of ownership of the lands, according to the Supreme Court, was now a matter “settled definitely and conclusively by the courts, and must be deemed well beyond the reach of review.”

On April 18, 1975, UP President Onofre D. Corpuz announced his administration’s intention to transfer nine hectares of Barrio Krus Na Ligas to its bona fide residents on the basis of communal ownership. This sought to resolve a 26-year-old problem between UP and the residents of Krus Na Ligas. Dr. Corpuz stated: “My decision was based primarily on the recognition that the population of both the barrio and of the University community will continue to grow, and that the early solution of the land problem would avert any possible collision in the future. I also hold the opinion that it was never the intention of the University to dispossess people of their rightful ownership to the land and that the transfer of this land to them would be in keeping with the spirit of the government’s national housing program for the masses.”

UP’s continued expansion to provide for housing spaces for its academic community had negative impacts on the community of Krus Na Ligas. According to accounts by Krus Na Ligas residents, in 1972 UP had the houses of farmers who were living in Sitio Paltok and Sitio Libis torn down, and in 1977, UP destroyed some of the farmlands to construct the Pook Amorsolo housing project. Expansion projects undertaken by the government also adversely affected the livelihood of the Krus Na Ligas farmers. From 1976 to 1981, the Ministry of Human Settlements destroyed more farmlands to construct the UP Sikatuna BLISS Housing Project of Imelda Marcos, then first lady and Metro Manila governor. Camp General Caringal was also established in this area. As a result, the once 2,000 hectares of land that the Krus Na Ligas ancestors had farmed shrank to around 50 hectares.

In 1986, the UP BOR, through UP President Edgardo J. Angara, granted a Deed of Donation granting 15.8 hectares to the residents of Krus Na Ligas. This Deed of Donation was executed by UP as the donor and the Quezon City government as the donee. It bore several terms and conditions that were to be implemented within 18 months from the date of donation. However, because the conditions of the donation were not met, UP President Jose Abueva issued Administrative Order No. 21 on February 6, 1988 declaring the Deed of Donation revoked.

Krus Na Ligas residents continued to campaign for the preservation of their farmlands. From 1990 to 1991, Krus Na Ligas farmers applied to the Department of Agrarian Reform to have their farmlands covered by the 1988 Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program. However, UP successfully opposed the petition. Construction of a housing project for UP faculty and employees in the late 1991 in what was formerly the community of Daang Tubo sparked protests among the Krus Na Ligas residents and farmers.

The complex relationship between UP and Krus Na Ligas

The relationship between UP and Barangay Krus Na Ligas from the 1990s onwards could be described as a complicated, at times uneasy, co-existence. The years 2003 to 2006 saw legal battles as Krus Na Ligas residents, who were to be the beneficiaries of the 15.8 hectares to be donated by UP to the Quezon City government, demanded the turnover of the title. This case was resolved in favor of UP as the donation was revoked by UP President Abueva since the Quezon City government was not able to fulfill some conditions in the deed of donation.

The historical lineage of Barangay Krus Na Ligas was recognized in 1998, when the National Historical Institute declared the Krus Na Ligas Church a historic site, together with the Plaza Sta. Ines, which was found to have been built in the early 18th century. That same year, the Krus Na Ligas church and Plaza Sta. Ines were also declared a historical site by the National Research Council of the Philippines and UP.

In 1998, the National Historical Institute declared the Holy Cross Parish and Plaza Sta. Ines, which according to historical evidence was built in the early 18th century, a historic site. Photo by Celeste Llaneta, UP MPRO.

 

In 2008, Republic Act No. 9500 or the UP Charter was signed. It prohibited the sale of real property owned by the national university. In 2011, UP President Alfredo Pascual created a UP Legal Team as a counterpart to the Quezon City Task Force UP and Its Surrounding Communities. Quezon City Mayor Herbert Bautista was cognizant of the aspects unique to Krus Na Ligas, such as that accounts indicate that the settlement dates back to the 1700s, preceding UP’s existence by hundreds of years, thus, the community cannot be simply demolished and resettled elsewhere. However, as Mayor Bautista pointed out in a letter to UP President Pascual, “the residents are also legally considered ‘informal settlers’ due to their lack of a title to the lands they are living on, and UP has not been able to make use of the land occupied by the community.” Krus Na Ligas presented a problem for the Quezon City government as well, because the residents could not be made to pay real property tax due to the lack of ownership documents over their property. Neither did they need to apply for building permits, even for the private structures they built, because they are legally under UP’s jurisdiction. Neither can the local government enforce order inside the community, because territorially, they are supposed to be within the security arrangement of UP. A solution that would mutually benefit all parties involved should therefore be sought.

 

Recourse to the law

In the succeeding years, discussions were held both within UP and between UP and the Quezon City government and the Krus Na Ligas community. In 2015, Speaker Feliciano Belmonte, Jr. filed House Bill No. 5737 (HB No. 165 in the 17th Congress) declaring a portion of UP Diliman a disposable asset for housing and urban settlement based on the constitutional precepts of social justice. The bill would amend the UP Charter by declaring Krus Na Ligas as the only exception to the provision prohibiting the sale of the University’s real property subject to the provisions of Republic Act No. 7279 or the Urban Development and Housing Act of 1992. UP sought clarification over what constituted the boundaries of Krus Na Ligas, and the appropriateness of RA No. 7279 as the basis for exempting Krus Na Ligas from RA No. 9500, given that existing data supplied by Krus Na Ligas barangay officials indicated the presence of at least 500 two-storey to four-storey residential buildings. Additionally, since many UP students, faculty and employees now live in Krus Na Ligas, the University has the responsibility to discuss the issue with its stakeholders and to see to their welfare.

On July 21, 2016, Senator Ralph G. Recto filed Senate Bill No. 864, and on October 24, 2017, Senator Vicente Sotto III filed Senate Bill No. 1606. Both bills sought to amend the UP Charter to authorize the sale of land in Barangay Krus Na Ligas to its legitimate and qualified residents. UP President Danilo Concepcion, in a letter dated February 2018 addressed to Senator Francis Escudero, chair of the Senate Committee on Education, Arts and Culture, clarified UP’s stand on the issue: that the metes and bounds of the Krus na Ligas property that UP would be authorized to sell should be fixed by geodetic survey; that UP should be authorized to sell only to the Quezon City government at an acceptable, fair and reasonable price; that the sale of the Krus Na Ligas property should be considered perfected from the time all parties have agreed on the price and terms of sale; and that immediately after the law takes effect, the Quezon City government would construct a fence along the boundaries segregating Krus Na Ligas from UP. On May 20, 2019, UP, the Senate Committee on Education, Arts and Culture and the Committee on Urban Planning, Housing and Resettlement held a joint public hearing to discuss SB No. 1606, SB No. 864 and HB No. 165.

 

Amending the UP Charter of 2008

Republic Act No. 11454, authored by Senate Pro-Tempore Recto, Senate President Sotto, and Senator Escudero, amends RA 9500 or the UP Charter, thus allowing UP to sell not more than 22.467 hectares of land in Barangay Krus Na Ligas at a fair market price acceptable to UP. During his sponsorship speech of the Senate bill that eventually became RA 11454, Senator Escudero emphasized the fact that Barangay Krus Na Ligas is a historic community that had existed since at least the Spanish period, predating modern-day Quezon City, a fact that has documentary proof.

However, UP can only sell this land to the Quezon City government at the agreed-upon price, and only until UP has received the full payment will ownership of the land be transferred to the Quezon City government. Payment must be made within one year after the execution of the agreement between UP and Quezon City. The law further states that the authorization of UP to sell is automatically revoked if UP and the Quezon City government fail to agree on the terms and conditions of the sale within one year from the effectivity of the law, or if UP has not received the full payment one year after the execution of the agreement. All in all, the law must be implemented in full approximately two years from its effectivity.

The terms and conditions of the sale of the land in Barangay Krus Na Ligas would be agreed upon by both UP and the Quezon City government. Once the ownership of the land is transferred from UP to the Quezon City government, the latter is to immediately fence off the property of UP to separate it from the area sold under the law. The city government must also transfer the property to legitimate residents of Barangay Krus Na Ligas. This transfer, said Senator Escudero in his sponsorship speech, may be done via donation or a program carried out by the NHA.

According to the law, the Quezon City government shall create a Technical Working Group to determine the “legitimate residents” of Barangay Krus Na Ligas—those whose long-standing residence in the area can sufficiently be established by authenticated documentary and testimonial evidence, who are themselves or through their predecessors-in-interest have been in continuous possession and occupation of the same parcels of land as owner since time immemorial, or for a period not less than thirty years. The Quezon City government shall also assist UP in resettling all the other settlers found in the remaining property in UP that is adjacent to the parcels of land in Barangay Krus Na Ligas.

Those who have been determined as “legitimate residents of Barangay Krus Na Ligas” are forbidden by the law to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of their lots or any right therein to anyone except their legal heirs. Otherwise, the transaction shall be rendered null and void, and the residents would lose their right to the land and forfeit the total amount of amortization they have paid. If the legitimate resident dies before full ownership of the land has been vested on him or her, his or her heirs shall assume both the full ownership of the land and its obligations. If the heirs somehow fail to assume the obligations, the land reverts to the Quezon City government for disposition.

To issue the necessary guidelines for the effective implementation of the law, an Interagency Committee would be created, to be headed by the Quezon City government and composed of representatives of UP, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the National Housing Authority.

While it is still a waiting game for Krus Na Ligas residents to fully acquire ownership of their lands as full implementation of the law may take two years from now, this is nothing compared to their decades’ long struggle to gain what is rightfully theirs.

Findings of the 14 Deaths with Prior Dengvaxia® Vaccination by the DOH-Commissioned Independent Evaluation Team of Physicians, the Philippine General Hospital Dengue Investigative Task Force (PGH DITF): An Interim Report 

 

Executive Summary

 

Under the directives of the Department of Health (DOH) Sec. Francisco T. Duque and the Philippine General Hospital (PGH) Director Dr. Gerardo D. Legaspi, the PGH Dengue Investigative Task Force (PGH DITF) was organized by Dr. Juliet O. Sio-Aguilar, Chair of the Department of Pediatrics, to serve as the independent body of expert physicians of PGH to evaluate the deaths of 14 children who were given one to three doses of the Dengvaxia® vaccine.

 

The DITF was instructed to thoroughly review each case to address the growing concern of the general public regarding the safety of the Dengvaxia® vaccine. The DITF was specifically tasked to determine the cause of death of each child and to assess if any possible association existed between the death and the vaccination.

 

The selection of members of the DITF was based on the following qualifications: the physician (1) must not be affiliated with any vaccine company, and (2) must not have administered the dengue vaccine to any patient. As a result of the stringent process of selection, the DITF formed consisted of 10 members: two (2) pediatric cardiologists, two (2) pediatric infectious disease specialists, one (1) pediatric emergency specialist, one (1) allergist/immunologist, one (1) pediatric gastroenterologist, one (1) pediatric nephrologist, one (1) neonatologist, and one (1) forensic pathologist. This 10-person team was complemented by four (4) other subspecialists whose expert opinions were solicited to clarify certain cases; these specialists were a pediatric neurologist, a pediatric hematologist-oncologist, a geneticist, and a rheumatologist. A team of three (3) pediatric residents served as the DITF’s secretariat.

 

In undertaking its task, the DITF identified the following terms of reference: definition of terms, mechanics and tools of evaluation, and process flow. The DITF then adapted the World Health Organization (WHO) Algorithm for Causality Assessment of Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) as its evaluation tool.

 

The WHO Algorithm for Causality Assessment of AEFI[1] is a systematic, scientifically sound, and universally accepted process of assessing causality of events following any vaccination. Based on this tool, the outcomes may be categorized as follows:

 

A. Consistent with causal association to immunization

A1. Vaccine product-related

A2. Vaccine quality defect-related

A3. Immunization error-related

A4. Immunization anxiety-related

 

B. Indeterminate

B1. Consistent temporal relationship but insufficient evidence for vaccine causing the event

B2. Conflicting trends of consistency with causal association to immunization

 

C. Inconsistent with causal association to immunization (coincidental)

Presence of underlying or emerging condition; or other condition caused by exposure to something other than the vaccine

 

D. Unclassifiable (additional information to determine causality is needed)

 

Of the fourteen (14) cases evaluated, the results of the DITF’s evaluation are as follows:

Three (3) cases under Category A1: consistent with causal association to immunization that is vaccine product-related; two (2) of which implicated vaccine failure;
Six (6) cases under Category B1: indeterminate only because of the consistent temporal relationship within a month of exposure of the vaccine but insufficient evidence for the vaccine causing the event;
Three (3) cases under Category C: coincidental because there was inconsistent causal association to immunization; and
Two (2) cases under Category D: unclassifiable due to inadequate information available.

 

The DITF recommends further investigations in order to clarify the nature of the association with vaccination or the cause of death for the following cases:

All three (3) A1 cases (Cases 1, 2, and 3) and two (2) indeterminate B1 cases (Cases 5 and 6) are recommended for further tissue evaluation for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) RNA of dengue virus, viral sequencing, and antibodies for the yellow fever and dengue viruses. Yellow fever- related tests are recommended as Dengvaxia® is a live attenuated vaccine using recombinant DNA technology created on the yellow fever (YF 17D) backbone.
One (1) indeterminate B1 case (Case 9), one (1) coincidental case (case 13), and both unclassifiable cases (Cases 12 and 14) may be subjected to further investigations, such as an autopsy to determine the nature of their disease and the cause of death.

 

The results of this evaluation are to be forwarded to the Pharmacovigilance Team of the DOH for further investigation and/or signal detection for possible new causal association. Only then can the investigation of these cases be completed and the results considered final.

 

Overarching the DITF recommendations is the call to ensure that:

clear, specific, and appropriate information be given to the public on dengue infection – its clinical presentation, actions to be taken for suspect cases, and preventive measures; and
all health practitioners do a thorough review of the existing treatment guidelines, particularly fluid management, in the care of such patients.

 

FACT SHEET:ADVERSE EVENT FOLLOWING IMMUNIZATION (AEFI) AND CAUSALITY ASSESSMENT

 

IS THERE A SYSTEM OR PROCESS FOR CHECKING WHETHER AN INCIDENT OR OUTCOME IS RELATED TO VACCINATION LIKE DENGVAXIA®?

Yes, the World Health Organization has developed a systematic, standardized, global process for evaluating whether an incident or outcome is related to any vaccination. This is the WHO Causality Assessment of Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI).

 

WHY WAS THE CAUSALITY ASSESSMENT FOR AEFI ESTABLISHED?

Immunization safety is an important aspect of vaccine development, just as the effectiveness of a vaccine is crucial. Unlike medicines or drugs, the expectations from vaccines (and vaccination) are much higher because these are given to healthy people. The reality is that the benefits of immunization are often not as obvious or visible and that it may even take months to years before an impact to the person and/or the society can be known. Thus, allegations that vaccines or the vaccination process cause adverse events must be addressed because this issue may have negatively influence immunization coverage.

It is thus the purpose of the WHO to guide the healthcare system to objectively analyze the events that occur surrounding the vaccination.

 

WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY CAUSALITY?

Causality is simply the relationship between two events, where the second event is a consequence of the first. A direct cause is a factor in absence of which the effect would not occur (necessary cause). Sometimes, there are multiple factors that may precipitate the effect (event) or may function as co-factors so that the event occurs.

 

WHAT IS CAUSALITY ASSESSMENT?

Causality assessment usually will not prove or disprove an association between an event and the immunization. It is intended to assist in determining the level of certainty of such an association. A definite causal association or absence of association often cannot be established for an individual event.

 

WHAT IS AN ADVERSE EVENT FOLLOWING IMMUNIZATION (AEFI)?

This refers to any untoward medical occurrence which follows immunization, and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the use of the vaccine. The adverse event may be any unfavorable or unintended sign, an abnormal laboratory finding, a symptom or a disease.

 

WHAT IS VACCINE FAILURE?

Vaccine failure refers to the development of the specific disease being prevented by the vaccine in a person who is appropriately and fully vaccinated, taking into account the incubation period of the disease and the normal delay for the protection to be acquired as a result of immunization. This may refer to both the vaccinee (or host)-related and vaccine-related factors.

 

WHAT IS VACCINE PHARMACOVIGILANCE?

This involves the science and activities relating to the detection, assessment, understanding, and communication of adverse events following vaccine- or immunization-related issues, and relating to the prevention of untoward effects of the vaccine or immunization. The goal is early detection of and the appropriate and timely response to AEFIs in order to minimize negative effects to the health of individuals and lessen the potential negative impact on immunization of the population.

 

WHAT IS A SAFETY SIGNAL?

A signal is an information (from one or multiple sources) which suggests a new and potentially causal association, or a new aspect of a known association between an intervention and an event, or set of related events, either adverse or beneficial, that is judged to be of sufficient likelihood to justify verificatory action.

 

WHY IS VACCINE PHARMACOVIGILANCE IMPORTANT?

There is a very high level of safety required for vaccines. The elements to consider when conducting vaccine pharmacovigilance include the following:

Shaping the key to unlocking cancer – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/shaping-the-key-to-unlocking-cancer/,"Shaping the key to unlocking cancer
May 10, 2017 | Written by Andre DP Encarnacion



It could hold the key to unlocking cancer’s secrets, and the Philippines could soon help in shaping that key.

Ten years ago, Francis Collins and Anna Barker, at that time from the National Human Genome Research Institute and the National Cancer Institute, respectively, wrote an article for Scientific American celebrating the launch of a milestone project in science and health research. Today, aspects of that research can be undertaken here at the University of the Philippines.

The project so loudly lauded by the pair was The Cancer Genome Atlas (note the acronym, TCGA) of the US National Institutes of Health.

Building on the technological and collaborative breakthroughs accomplished by the Human Genome Project, TCGA is a massive collection of multi-dimensional maps of notable genomic changes found in at least 33 types of cancers.

All 2.5 petabytes (1 PB=1,000,000 GB) of data on these cancers from 11,000 patients are now publicly available, thanks to the efforts of a vast network of research and technology teams. Researchers have established that cancer is primarily caused by mutations in specific genes to create a catalog of genetic mutations that, for instance, cause normal cells to turn malignant.

Through this analysis of each cancer cell’s complete set of genes, its genome, and how these changes within them interact on a broader scale, scientists attempt to improve cancer prevention, detection, and treatment.

An interdisciplinary environment

One key dimension that Collins and Barker revealed in their work is the highly multidisciplinary environment in genomics and cancer research, an environment of which the TCGA is both a promoter and a product.

Such global and eclectic projects naturally encourage players from traditionally distinct research areas to capture the complexity of biological phenomena using a unique set of scientific tools.

Increasingly, therefore, biologists and clinicians who had long manned the front lines of cancer and health research are finding themselves shoulder to shoulder with a different sort of ally.

Armed with algorithms, software, and statistical modeling techniques, this new class of researcher allows initiatives like the TCGA to share and make better sense of the hundreds of terabytes of genomics data being produced globally. These data sets, many believe, hide important secrets to preserving human health and to uncovering deep truths about the origins and future of life on the planet.

Enter the Filipino scientist. To take advantage of these exciting developments, the UP Board of Regents approved the creation of the Computational Genomics and Systems Biology (CGSB) research program at the Philippine Genome Center (PGC) in January 2017.

Marrying two fields

The reorganization of the PGC allowed its researchers to group genomics and systems biology—normally considered distinct areas of study—into a single R&D program. PGC Executive Director Baltazar D. Aguda, himself a systems biologist and cancer expert, explained what holds these different parts firmly together.

“Genomics is all about genomes,” Aguda said, referring to the genetic material of an organism, made up of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) that some call the blueprint for creating an organism. Information in DNA is encoded in a sequence of four letters or bases, the aforementioned T, C, G, and A which stand for thymine, cytosine, guanine, and adenine.

Sequences of these letters run along every DNA strand in different arrangements and permutations, totaling around 3 billion for each person. The primary challenge of genomics lies in interpreting the meaning behind these four-letter sequences. Some of these sequences, less than 2% of them, are called genes, which contain the code for the creation of molecules called proteins.

And the rest? “What does the bulk of our DNA do?” asked Aguda. This, he said, was an open question, one that the men and women of the PGC are trying their hand at answering. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, PGC researchers are sequencing the DNA of a wide variety of organisms, from plants like coconuts to microorganisms like infectious bacteria.

While genomics attempts to uncover the secrets behind the fundamental units of life, systems biology views the components and space-time scales of organisms as one integrated and holistic system.

“If DNA sequences are not complex enough for you,” Aguda said, “think of networks of interactions among genes, proteins, cells and organs.” These networks and interactions are the fertile ground that systems biologists till for scientific insights.

Modeling and predicting 

Unlike its “wet laboratory” counterparts, the CGSB is, as its name implies, an initiative built around computation. The language of life is read by these scholars via the Rosetta Stone of equations and computer models.

More specifically, computational genomics researchers use advanced mathematics and computer algorithms to decipher the meaning behind huge linear arrays of the T, C, G, and A found in DNA. Computational systems biologists, on the other hand, generate models to simulate how genes affect the development and behavior of biological systems (e.g., a particular organism)."

June 30, 2019 | Written by J. Mikhail Solitario



While the right to privacy and invasion of privacy have been the topics of national conversations involving data leaks from celebrities or politicians, the idea of privacy itself remains abstract among many. In fact, words like “private” or “privatization” have loose Filipino translations, and there seems to be no exact term for “privacy” in our native language. Instead, we have vague impressions of privacy or its absence as we deal with the loss of personal space in cramped jeepneys, with gossiping neighbors or when oversharing in social media.

The Act and its Commission

In fact, when asked whether privacy has attained the status of being a household term, Deputy Commissioner Dino Aguirre of the National Privacy Commission says that appreciation of the concept of privacy is still largely limited to the academe, or those of a particular educational background or exposure. From his experience in interfacing with various stakeholders, Aguirre observes that the level of public awareness still needs a lot of work, which can be attributed mainly to culture. Even jurisprudence (e.g., Vivares v. St. Theresa’s College, GR No. 202666) has constantly confused types of privacy, often switching decisional privacy (i.e., the right to keep behavior on sensitive issues private, such as sexual preference, political activities, and religious practices) with locational or situational privacy (i.e., the right to move in spaces without being identified, tracked, or monitored) and informational privacy.

The work of the National Privacy Commission as the country’s privacy watchdog deals primarily with informational privacy, i.e., the right to secure personal data and information from individuals or organizations that are not authorized to access, handle, or distribute such information. The Commission’s central mandate is to implement and ensure compliance with the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Republic Act 10173). This important legislation aims to protect individuals by regulating the handling of data, and guarantees that the Philippines meets international standards on data protection.

Since the Data Privacy Act (DPA) was enacted into law with its corresponding implementing rules and regulations (IRR), the common notion of privacy being traditionally tied to location (private or public spaces) has evolved to become one of the fundamental human rights of the individual. Privacy now revolves around the individual’s level of control over his or her personal data or information. However, one of the more common misconceptions of the coverage of the DPA needs to be dispelled: it does not only apply to digital or online data, as it applies to data on paper as well. Compliance does not merely depend on investing on the latest technology on data security. Compliance actually takes into account the installation of proper policies, procedures, and processes in handling data. In relation to the coverage of the law, Aguirre emphasized, “It would help tremendously if we would be able to properly characterize the scope of the DPA to be limited to personal information.” Personal information pertains to any data that could directly or indirectly identify a person.

This year, the Commission saw a significant increase in the complaints that they received compared to last year, with complaints for the first half of 2019 surpassing the 2018 aggregate total. A huge number of complaints were classified as informal and were never followed up. To address this issue, the Commission employed an institutional approach by coming up with resource materials that make compliance easier to private companies, government agencies, and organizations so that they understand what the law requires. Sectoral associations were also tapped to gather issues that are unique to each sector. Before 2018 ended, a campaign focusing on data subjects was launched to emphasize the rights of individuals.

Forensics 2.0 comes to the Philippines – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/forensics-2-0-comes-to-the-philippines/,"


In 2016, National Geographic ran a story on the case of Sierra Bouzigard, a 19-year-old from Louisiana, USA who was found beaten to death seven years prior. Although in the fatal struggle Bouzigard managed to get some of her attacker’s tissue under her nails, traditional methods of matching DNA to suspect failed to yield any result. Policemen were stumped.

With the collected DNA their only lead, the case analyst decided to take a chance and send the evidence to Parabon Nanolabs, a company specializing in “DNA phenotyping.” Using so-called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, pronounced “snips”), which are variations in a single building block of DNA, Parabon promised to conjure a rough likeness of the sample’s owner that would include certain physical features and probable ethno-geographic ancestry.

While the analysis of these characteristics is in its relative infancy and not without controversy, its use in the Bouzigard case highlighted the question of how much more science could contribute in the pursuit of justice. If a broader variety of DNA markers could be simultaneously analyzed to build on what current methods can accomplish, how much more sophisticated could our power to discriminate and investigate become?

That question is one of many that the DNA Analysis Laboratory, Natural Sciences Research Institute, UP Diliman (DNA Analysis Laboratory, NSRI-UPD) is currently trying to address. Using breakthrough technology called “Next Generation Sequencing” (NGS), University research associates Jazelyn M. Salvador and Dame Loveliness T. Apaga are now getting a first-hand glimpse of the answers.

The gold standard

The laboratory, headed overall by Dr. Maria Corazon A. De Ungria, is no stranger to breakthrough contributions. Its work was a major driver behind the approval by the Supreme Court of the 2007 Rules on DNA Evidence that set terms and guidelines for the conduct of DNA testing and its specific applications in Philippine courts.

The technology behind much of the team’s success to date is called capillary electrophoresis (CE). In creating a DNA profile for any individual using this method, members of the team look at what they call “short tandem repeats” (STRs). These are areas in the genome with sequences of nucleotides, made up of combinations of nitrogen bases: (G)uanine, (T)hymine, (A)denine and (C)ytosine. True to their name, STRs are sequences of these bases that repeat a certain number of times with successive repeats being located next to each other (i.e., TCGA-TCGA-TCGA…).

The laboratory typically examines a person’s DNA profile in 20 of these STR regions that are found across 22 so-called “autosomal” chromosomes, as well as in the X and Y, or human sex chromosomes. In a sample like blood or saliva, which has sufficient amounts of DNA, these pre-selected DNA regions or markers are amplified or “photocopied” via a process called the Polymerase Chain Reaction or PCR.

“After amplification,” Jazelyn says, “fragments of DNA are separated by length via CE, where they migrate along an electric field through a tube separating anode from cathode. Because of their size, smaller fragments can migrate from start to end much faster.

Fragments, distinguished by the number of repeats using a reference set, are then detected by a laser via fluorescent tags. The result of this process is a person’s DNA profile. As more STR regions are analyzed, the probability that two unrelated individuals would have the same DNA profile on each DNA marker becomes increasingly remote.

Dame also spoke about how CE continues to be the gold standard for human identification. “The system is stable and accurate, and is relatively easy to use for forensic applications.” The technique, however, has its limits. Because of the relative length of STRs, creating a suitable profile may not always be possible, especially with degraded DNA. The latter situation is unfortunately all too common in disaster areas and in many crime scenes.

Next Generation Sequencing

“That’s the advantage of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), also known as Massively Parallel Sequencing,” Dame continues, referring to the newest technology being validated by the laboratory. “This technology enables a researcher to study and sequence several markers simultaneously, thereby significantly increasing the amount of information that can be mined from the sample.” In fact, NGS can be used to sequence an entire genome at a relatively shorter time compared to more traditional procedures.

The NGS project by the Laboratory funded by DOST-PCHRD has for the most part used Illumina’s MiSeq FGx Forensic Genomics System. Using this platform, billions of short, single-stranded templates of DNA are attached to a slide. Fluorescently-labeled nucleotides are added one by one to the templates, after which a photo is taken that captures light from color-coded bases. The process is repeated with these bases added one at a time until sequencing is complete.

Who’s afraid of the Endocrine Witch? – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/whos-afraid-of-the-endocrine-witch/,"Who’s afraid of the Endocrine Witch?
September 4, 2017 | Written by Andre DP Encarnacion



While her online supporter base knows her better as the Endocrine Witch (and her equally popular recent moniker, “Dok Bru,” short for “Doctor Bruha”), UP-PGH Endocrinologist Iris Thiele Isip-Tan has certainly become many things to many people in recent years.

The Endocrine Witch is the first ever Gawad Pangulo awardee for Progressive Teaching and Learning.

The wife and mother of two sons is best known to her official patients as an endocrinologist—an internist, or duktor ng lamang loob, in her terms, specializing in thyroid, diabetes, adrenal, and other hormone disorders. To her colleagues at the UP College of Medicine, she is a highly innovative teacher—the first-ever Gawad Pangulo Award winner for Progressive Teaching and Learning and an advocate of blended learning.

To many of her online followers, however, Iris still best known as perhaps the best online local source for educated views on endocrinology. Moreover, as the current head of the UP Manila Medical Informatics Unit and the Director of the UP Manila Interactive Learning Center, she is currently helping others utilize digital technology to improve the Philippine health landscape.

Iris’ moniker was famously adopted early on from the sisterhood of strict mentors in endocrinology who were themselves called “witches.” ” One of my mentors said, ‘You’re even proud to be called a witch.’ But then I told them that we already have characters like Hermione Granger from Harry Potter, who go against the traditional concept. So that’s how it started.”

The right information

With several definitions of “health informatics” floating in cyberspace, Iris had to construct one for herself. “Health informatics is that field where we aim to get the right information to the right person at the right time,” she says. This overarching vision, though simple to some, has become a guiding philosophy for her, one which she can easily impart to the lay person.

There are few avenues in this doctor’s life that reflect this more than her Facebook page. Begun in 2012 as a complement to her official web pages (dokbru.endocrine-witch.net and endocrine-witch.net), it emerged to give her readers access to her content on “free data” packs. Despite not being able to give actual consultations online, Dr. Isip-Tan thought there was at least some information she could give out to help the public make better health decisions."

A crowd of developers and engineers with laptops packed the small white room at the iAcademy in Makati City for the day’s workshop on data analysis and machine learning. The diverse audience contrasted with the fact that the event’s technical facilitators were all female. Casually dressed and with years of training behind them, the team featured UP molecular biologist Iris Diana Uy, who led participants last February through the meticulous process of slicing and merging arrays of data.

As Uy took the stage, the rest stood at attention, ready to assist. Donning a red baseball cap, computer scientist Issa Tingzon later showcased introductory exercises on finding correlations to help machines make predictions. Meanwhile, Clau Yagyagan and Marylette Roa assisted individually. Roa, in particular, who had never fancied herself a skilled communicator, navigated all corners of the room helping participants stay on the same page and resolving their coding errors with well-placed suggestions.

Roa, who works as a bioinformatician at the UP Marine Sciences Institute (UP MSI), says that what binds their group of experts together is a commitment to education and empowerment. As with fellow UP-trained researchers Uy and Tingzon, she is a member of Women Who Code Manila, the local network of a global community dedicated to inspire women to excel in technology careers.

Through study groups, panel discussions, and other events, members of the group provide a space for women (and men, as well) to develop their skills and connect with current and aspiring coders across the country.

The shift from working strictly as a scientist to also being a part-time mentor was an opportunity that Roa fully embraced. Her path towards that role, however, while rewarding, was a journey in itself.

 

A bioinformatics pioneer

After graduating from the UP National Institute for Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (UP NIMBB), Roa had her first professional coding stint as a pioneer member of the Philippine Genome Center’s (PGC) Core Facility for Bioinformatics, where Uy also was. “I just wanted to try it,” Roa says, who did disproportionately more “wet” laboratory work as an undergraduate compared to the data analysis that would become her forte. This post, in contrast, explicitly required her to use computer science and statistical techniques to solve biological problems.

It was at the PGC that Roa would work under her mentor, the molecular geneticist and bioinformatician, Arturo Lluisma. It was Lluisma, she says , who decided that the group would use the programming language Python—the language she would soon be teaching. During their capacity-building phase, which began in 2012, the young scientists both trained as well as trained themselves in the tools to analyze genomics data. Mingled in with this scientific training were more practical skills, such as server administration and talking to clients, which would likewise slot into Roa’s future mentoring toolkit.

While her skills in coding grew at the PGC and in a brief stint at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM), Roa did not yet arrive at her vocation as a mentor. What led her towards the coding community even before officially transferring to Lluisma’s MSI laboratory in 2017 was a desire that many women in technical fields likely experience—to have other women to talk to.

“It was a little weird,” Roa says, “because I was coding and doing data analysis, while my lab-mates were doing wet laboratory-style basic research.” While she could still count on her teammates and Uy for conversation, she felt the need to connect with more women doing her kind of technical work. “People who develop tools and software, who you could talk to about best practices in the field.”

September 4, 2017 | Written by Arlyn VCD Palisoc Romualdo



“It’s not really music. Not in the strictest sense.”

National Artist for Music, composer, ethnomusicologist, and UP University Professor Emeritus Ramon Pagayon Santos was referring to his area of research—non-Western indigenous expressive traditions included in the genre called “ethnic music.” Music, he said, is a Western concept defined by elements such as structure, counterpoint, harmony, texture, and form, among others.

“I prefer calling it ‘non-music’ because it doesn’t fit that idea.”

Santos began questioning the use of “music” to refer to such expressive practices because of an incident at a Philippine music festival he organized when he was dean of the College of Music.

“I had invited three guitarists and a dancer from Batangas to participate. Imagine my surprise when two jeepney loads arrived!” During the performance, he said the others acted as bystanders who would react loudly and throw money at the performers. “That type of ‘music’ wasn’t meant for just listening because it wouldn’t have the intended effect. It needed the participation of the ‘community.’ There was an experiential condition.”

October 5, 2017 | Written by Jo. Florendo B. Lontoc



Marine mammals—such as whales, dolphins, dugongs—are descended from ancestors that lived entirely on land. Fleeing from terrestrial competition, they turned to the waters and the vast resources of its depths.

The Philippines is rife with marine mammals, a fact confirmed by stranding incidences—more than 800 recorded since 2005—exceeding the normal numbers in the region.

Professor Lemnuel Aragones is UP’s foremost expert on marine mammals and heads its only laboratory for marine mammal research. This research includes processing strandings. Though unfortunate and still largely unexplained, strandings provide the opportunity for closely studying marine mammals in their environment.

When not responding to or saving stranded marine mammals, or doing office, mentoring and laboratory work in UP and various training venues, or Skype-meeting with colleagues, Lem is farther offshore, swimming with grazing dugongs of Busuanga, Palawan, or spotting dolphins at Tañon Strait in central Visayas.

But Lem has not always been at sea. Like marine mammals, Lem saw his career make a decisive step from land to sea.

By the river in Africa

As a child, Lem traveled across the globe with his father, who was a consultant of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. From 10 to 14 years old, he moved back and forth between the Philippines and Malawi, where his father taught at the Bunda College of Agriculture. He stayed at Lilongwe, the capital. Located in the Great East African Rift Valley, Lilongwe was strange land with a nature sanctuary in the middle, surrounding the Lilongwe River that drains to Lake Malawi.

Often, the car little Lem was riding in had to stop and let wild animals cross the road.

“Giraffes, elephants, zebras, and antelopes! So many!” the adult Lem excitedly recalls. But back then, he lived in a gated subdivision, guarded, and ferried in VIP vehicles. He watched from a car window. “Big animals have a certain majesty,” he says.

Malawi left him with a legacy of fascination. Returning to the Philippines, Lem was sold on a Zoology course in college. He would graduate in UP Los Baños in 1986 with a special project on bats and a non-thesis degree in Field Zoology. His graduation prize from his parents was a solo trip to Puerto Princesa, Palawan.

Lem meets a duyong

Officially an adult, he was free. In Puerto Princesa, he jumped onto fishing boats and sailed off with the crew to remote islands. As the fishermen laid out the nets, Lem would put on his mask, snorkel, and fins, and swim alone in the open sea.

One day off San Vicente, Palawan, on a second dive near the coast, he saw billows of murk rising from the bottom. As he dove deeper, a gray mass began to move in the murk. It was bigger than he. Lem frantically swam toward the boat. “Help!” he shouted, grasping an outrigger. “Shark!”

The crew saw the dark figure peek at the surface before gliding back under. “Ay, that’s a duyong!” they said.

Lem would not be eaten. The animal was simply grazing on the seagrass on the bottom, stirring up sediments.

Even as a graduate of Zoology, Lem had not heard of duyong. Returning to Los Baños, his father advised him to consult the Department of Environment and Natural Resources in Manila.

“We have dugong in the country,” the DENR officer said. The animal he saw was most likely it, but the officer could not give details. At that point, Lem vowed to study the big marine animal that had scared him so much. He ended up earning a master’s in Marine Science in UP Diliman.

UP alumni scientists continue to lead research and provide data on saving Philippine freshwater ecosystems such as that which supports the tawilis, recently declared an endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

For example, key resource speakers in the Tawilis Summit 2019 were: UP alumni scientists, Dr. Mudjekeewis Santos and Dr. Maria Theresa Mutia, who graduated from UP Baguio and UP Los Baños, respectively, and are now with the National Fisheries Research and Development Institute; Dr. Jonas Quilang of the UP Diliman Institute of Biology; and, UP Diliman alumna Dr. Alicia Ely Pagulayan, now with the University of Santo Tomas.

Hosted by the University of Santo Tomas, the summit was an immediate multisectoral response led by scientists to the IUCN red-listing of a Philippine endemic. It was held in the Buenaventura Garcia Paredes, OP Building, España, Manila on February 19, 2019.

Saving the tawilis, found only in Taal Lake, has long been a rallying cry of freshwater scientists who advocate sustainable management and conservation of all Philippine freshwater bodies and their ecologies. As early as 2000, scientists such as Prof. Augustus Mamaril of the UP Diliman Institute of Biology had been raising red flags on the tawilis, with Mamaril even proposing its translocation to another Philippine freshwater body.

Spearheaded by the recently launched Philippine Society for Freshwater Sciences, led by its interim president, Dr. Francis Magbanua also of the UP Diliman Institute of Biology, the recent tawilis summit was able to gather a sizeable number of government and non-government scientists and research staff, students, administrators, local government executives including two town mayors, and fishing and aquaculture organizations in the Taal Volcano Protected Landscape (TVPL).

Maria Paz Luna, currently chief of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Region IV-A and of the multi-sectoral management of the TVPL, was present in the summit to get the latest scientific research and recommendations from the scientists and other stakeholders.

Luna gave an update on the TVPL management plan and her own recommendations to strengthen management and conservation initiatives in TVPL, including more research, which she found relatively lacking. She also joined roundtable discussions with stakeholder representatives.

November 10, 2017 | Written by Celeste Ann Castillo Llaneta



At the side of the main entrance of UP Baguio, in a kiosk underneath one of the many pine trees that mark UP’s northernmost campus, is an institution perhaps as beloved among the members of the UP community as the Oblation itself: a peanut vendor famously known as Nanay Mani.

Nanay Mani, whose real name is Mrs. Lolita Lazaro, has been selling peanuts, biscuits, mangos and assorted fruits and snack foods to generations of UP students since 1968, when she was just in her mid-twenties. At that time, she and her husband, Juanito Lazaro, were newly married and had settled in Baguio City. He eventually found work in UP Baguio, and Nanay Mani, who has worked as a vendor since her childhood in Lingayen, Pangasinan, began selling peanuts and snack food in the schools and universities in Baguio City.

 

 

“For decades now, and in all the schools here. There is no school that I haven’t gone into to sell my wares, even the Philippine Military Academy during graduation. I’ve been in all of them,” she recalls.

But out of all those schools, UP Baguio is the one she loves best and where she chose to stay. “UP is different, because here no matter what your station in life is—even if you are just a vendor—they treat you with respect. In UP, even the children of senators are my children. If they see me walking down the street, they give me rides in their cars, even today. It’s different here. In UP, even if I’m just a peanut vendor, the kids love me.”"

“When I face an ordinary Filipino citizen, and he asks me who I am, I want to be able to tell him that I know what he’s going through and that we can help each other.” This is what keeps Attorney Hanna Keila Garcia serving in government despite criticism from some people, including family and friends.

Kei, as people fondly call her, has lived a life of conflicts and contradictions. While she had always seen herself eventually taking up Law, her undergraduate degree in Sociology made her ask whether this was the right step to take. Sociology forced her to to question a lot of things. It taught her that, most of the time, getting the right answers meant asking the right questions, too.

Twin tools

Initially, she saw the study of law as something rigid, with set ways, and not dynamic enough when it came to interpretations of the law. So instead of going straight to law school after graduation like some of her batchmates, she took a gap year and taught Sociology in a state university before finally taking up law. Now, she finds the twin training of sociology and law as helpful tools in her policy work as a staff member of the Office of the Deputy Executive Secretary for General Administration in Malacañang.

She has also devoted most of her life to public service, starting in student government as early as when she was in the third grade. While her batchmates in University of the Philippines College of Law focused on getting good grades in order to get recruited by big law firms as interns and eventually as associates, Kei knew from the very start that she wasn’t interested in joining the private sector, wanting to link her education with her advocacy. She continued teaching Sociology in all her years in UP Law, enriching her lessons with what she learned in Malcolm Hall.

Kei joined the Office of the President (OP) towards the end of the previous administration while waiting for the results of her bar examinations. With the start of the current administration in 2016, her immediate boss, Deputy Executive Secretary Michael Ong, himself a graduate of UP Law, offered her an opportunity to stay in the OP and continue to be part of his staff and of the Office of the Executive Secretary (OES). Given a week to decide and with other offers to work in the offices of a senator and several representatives, she chose to stay in the Palace. “I honestly wanted more action, to be in the middle of things with great impact. I wanted to see how things were run, and to learn more about governance firsthand,” she says.

“They’re always surprised that a Filipino is doing plasma research, especially in relation to materials.”

This is a common reaction to Magdaleno “Jong” Vasquez Jr. when he meets foreign scientists. They’re even more surprised, he says, when he tells them that he works on ion sources. “And I’m working on low-energy ion sources when most are working on high-energy.”

Why the astonishment from foreigners? It seems the Philippines is not big on research in plasma and vacuum science and technology and their allied fields with their wide range of applications. There are very few Filipinos in the country who undertake research in these areas; so for the rest of the scientific world, meeting someone like Jong would be a pleasant shock.

But he’s confident that things are picking up, that more are becoming interested in these fields. Jong has been doing what he can to promote these areas of study, starting with UP.

 

Pasalubong from Japan

It’s a traditional Filipino practice to bring back items from a place one has visited, to give to loved ones back home. Jong’s pasalubong—an improved, smaller version of an ion source he created for his doctorate in Electrical Engineering at Doshisha University—started the ball rolling in 2013.

He had already been teaching at the College of Engineering in UP Diliman (UPD) before he left for his doctoral studies and he had every intention of going back to the University when he was done. While Jong had earned his doctorate in 2011, he stayed for two more years in Japan, working in a company where his adviser, Dr. Motoi Wada, was a consultant. “It was like post-doc training.”

To say that those two years were productive is an understatement. Jong was not only able to file two patents that were accepted in Japan and Korea, but he also worked on his pasalubong for UP during weekends. “It had to be small enough to fit into my luggage.”

When he came back to the Philippines, he filed an application for the University’s Balik PhD Program, a grant from the UP System that provides a P2.5 million startup fund to encourage foreign-trained PhD graduates to teach and do research in UP. But for some reason, the application papers got mixed up with documents for his faculty position. It took a while to fix, but he was able to finally get the grant in October 2014.

“Without that seed money, I wouldn’t have been able to put up the lab at the time that I did,” he says, referring to the Plasma-Material Interactions Laboratory (PMIL) at the Department of Mining, Metallurgical, and Materials Engineering (DMMME), where he is currently on his second term as department chairperson.

 

More funds, more research, more people

Even with the Balik PhD grant, Dr. Vasquez still looked for other funding sources to support research at PMIL. Before 2014 ended, he had gotten two more grants that totaled over P13 million. By the start of 2015, PMIL was a “working” facility, in the sense that experiments could be done.

“I just keep on applying for grants, especially for equipment outlay. Not necessarily to buy new ones, but to restore what would otherwise just sit and rot.” They’ve restored three so far and with added funds, may be able to repair more, according to him.

Holding on to a dream – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/holding-on-to-a-dream/,"Holding on to a dream
May 4, 2018 | Written by Arlyn VCD Palisoc Romualdo



It was a yearning she just couldn’t shake off. As a high school senior back in 1963, Virgie Garcia wanted to study painting and pursue a Fine Arts degree in UP Diliman. Fifty years later, she finally enrolled in the program.

The dream had evolved over the course of those five decades, but its essence never really changed. She still wanted to study Fine Arts in UP. But it wasn’t about getting the degree anymore. She just wanted to learn.

 

Passion for learning

When Virgie tells the story of how she had to forego the Fine Arts program for a BS in Education, there’s no regret in her voice. “I had to be realistic and practical. I needed to earn a degree that could land me a job after graduation.”

Back then, becoming a teacher was a much better option than becoming a starving artist—especially for someone whose father was a radio technician, whose mother was a dressmaker, and who was only the second of six children. It meant she needed to help support her family.

Virgie wasn’t completely devastated over the decision she had to make. She simply saw it as an opportunity to learn and enrich herself intellectually. And that appetite for knowledge remains to this day. “Even at my age, there’s still so much to know. I’m still curious and fascinated by so many things in the world.”

In her second year at UP, the teenager who wanted to be an artist but studied to be a teacher was so swayed by her interest in the natural sciences that she shifted to the BS Chemistry program. She graduated in 1969 and when the results of the licensure exams were released in 1970, she was number nine in the top-ten list of successful examinees.

Climbing the corporate ladder

Fresh off university life, Virgie’s first job was in quality assurance at Johnson & Johnson, where she stayed for six months. She then moved on to the UP College of Medicine as a project researcher, also staying there for six months. “That was where I got the idea for my next job,” she says and continues with a laugh, “from one of the reagents we used!”

It was so random that she still couldn’t believe how well it turned out. Virgie saw the name of the company that produced that reagent and told herself to just apply for a job there. That company was Warner Chilcott (later Warner Lambert), where, for 25 years, she moved up the ranks—from a technician/analyst in quality assurance to production supervisor to managerial positions in procurement as well as production planning and inventory control.

In 1977, seven years into her stint at Warner Lambert, she began to pursue an MBA at the Ateneo de Manila University. While she’s a thesis short of her degree, she was successful at applying everything she had learned as her position in the company got higher.

In 1995, Virgie transferred to Century Pacific Food Inc., holding corporate managerial positions in procurement, production planning and inventory control, and warehouse and shipping.  “I never would have thought, growing up as I did in Sta. Mesa, studying in public elementary and high schools, that I would reach the positions that I had in the corporate world.”

She was later promoted to assistant vice president and had become such a valuable part of the company that they asked her to postpone her retirement when she turned 60 in 2007. After a few years, she again expressed her desire for retirement to pursue formal studies in Fine Arts. The company agreed to let her do the latter and in 2013, at age 66, she went back to UP while still with Century Pacific."

For some people in this unique office, a day at work means getting up at the break of dawn to sail off to a nearby reef, and spend the rest of the day on an island in the sun, the salt crusting on their arms. Some stay behind at headquarters, tending saltwater tanks where colorful marine creatures reside. On the waves or onshore, these workers have special skills meant to sustain life in our vast and resource-rich oceans.

These are the people of the University of the Philippines Marine Science Institute-Bolinao Marine Laboratory (BML). As in leading scientific research institutions in Southeast Asia, BML has these dedicated employees who have made BML the efficient and dynamic institution that it is today.

Unlike typical UP employees, they ride speed boats to work, and have the ocean or marine water tanks as their offices. They use dive suits as their uniforms and dive gear as their gadgets. They also employ interesting specialized tools at work other than the regular calculators and staplers.

 

BML’s sentinels

Renato Adolfo landed his first job at BML as a boatman. He then turned into a laboratory aide, spending most of his time focused on the hatchery laboratory. He primarily assists in all experiments assigned to him by various marine science scholars and researchers stationed at the research center. His latest task is with the ongoing giant clam project, from the spawning all the way to the settlement phase.

Handling the continuous sea cucumber and sea ranch projects, and the most recent invertebrate project under Prof. Marie Antonette Juinio-Meñez, is laboratory aide Tirso Catbagan. He is in charge of the spawning and restocking of sea cucumbers, as well as of managing a five-hectare sea ranch in coordination with a people’s organization in the area.

Alfonso Rubio Jr. keeps good company with every marine researcher or visitor at sea. Alfon is one of BML’s four boatmen who give smooth and safe rides to the giant clam nursery at Silaqui Island. Besides the boat rides, he heads the dive gear unit. He ensures the overall condition and maintenance of all diving apparatus, especially the boats and oxygen tanks which are refilled by BML’s own heavy-duty oxygen compressors.

BML’s longtime handyman is Christopher Diolazo. He takes care of both the electric and plumbing systems of the whole facility. Meanwhile, BML administrative officer Charina Caalim is the overall custodian of the research center. She manages all of BML’s engagements, support, and services from the use of the facility to project collaborations.

Brando Padilla is BML’s newest face, taking on an important task as a volunteer patroller at the giant clam nursery at Silaqui Island. Only this year, he decided to volunteer along with a few others who are all residents of the island to watch over the giant clams and protect them. At the same time, he is a regular member of Bolinao’s local government fishing patrol unit known as Bantay Dagat. He monitors the safety and fishing activities covering the fifteen-mile sea stretch from Silaqui Island to San Fernando, La Union’s boundary.

From watchers to trainers

Laboratory aides Renato and Tirso have been serving BML for 11 and 26 years, respectively. All these years have trained them in various aspects of marine research through their hands-on facilitation and assistance.

Surprisingly, both laboratory aides were able to discuss in scientific and descriptive detail the developmental stages of some marine species they have focused on for years, such as sea cucumbers and giant clams. They were also able to formulate their own observations, recommendations, and suggestions, to include government policies concerning marine management and conservation which may be able to improve existing ones.

IUCN red-listing of tawilis reveals advocacy of Philippine scientists – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/iucn-red-listing-of-tawilis-reveals-advocacy-of-philippine-scientists/,"IUCN red-listing of tawilis reveals advocacy of Philippine scientists
May 16, 2019 | Written by Jo. Florendo B. Lontoc

The humble Tawilis is famous for being the only Sardinella fish to live entirely in freshwater, and it can only be found in Taal Lake. Surrounding towns and cities consider the tawilis a staple food, and tourists love them deep-fried and served with Batangas bulalo.

But all good things come to an end—and in this case, it was an abrupt one. A cursory Google search on tawilis as an endangered species yields a slew of news articles that echoed public panic in the wake of a reassessment of the fish’s status by the Switzerland-based International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in October 2018.

Before then, news on the endangerment of the tawilis had been few and far between, even after multiple warnings from the scientific community.

Despite moderate progress being made via recently imposed fishing regulations, there has been pushback from people who depend on the lake for their livelihood.

In the brine-soaked hands of a handful of scientists lay the full story of the tawilis, as well as the key to its survival— tale of declining catch, pollution, wanton fishing, and careless human development.

The advocacy of scientists

“The catch was dwindling, and fish size was smaller and thin,” Augustus C. Mamaril of the UP Diliman Institute of Biology, quotes general observations from the lakeside town as far back as the 1990s. He raised the alarm on the lake which has been a field demonstration and specimen collection site for his Biology class since the late 1980s.

His motivations for proposing the translocation of tawilis to Lake Lanao in northern Mindanao in 1997 were scientific as well as sentimental: he was inspired by the all-out assistance extended by the late Raymundo Punongbayan, director of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology.

“Tawilis and practically all of the Taal biota, including a highly venomous marine snake, are the end product, or captives, of a violent volcanic eruption in geologically recent times,” Mamaril says. “The organisms are of marine origin. There was a time when sharks swam in Taal!”

Maria Theresa Mercene-Mutia of the National Fisheries Research and Development Institute (NFRDI) points to declining catch, observed through at least 20 years’ worth of research dating back to the 1990s. Initial exploitation rates were contributed by studies published in 1996 by the Southern Tagalog Integrated Agricultural Research Center, led by Leah Villanueva.

Mutia, a UP Los Baños alumna, was a research assistant of the Taal Lake pioneer environmental scientist, Dr. Macrina Zafaralla, also of UP Los Baños. Mutia serendipitously found herself assigned to a biological station in Taal, Batangas, when she worked for BFAR in the early 1990s. Her immersive devotion to the study of the lake fisheries led to a love for the town, which she has since called home. Her work now forms the backbone of most studies on the tawilis.

She is not alone in her work. Before 1991, the spawning characteristics  of tawilis were studied by a BFAR team headed by Simeona Aypa; and around 1999, aspects of its reproductive biology were further researched by Alicia Ely Joson-Pagulayan, a UP Diliman alumna currently with the University of Santo Tomas. In 2008, Rey Donne Papa of the University of Santo Tomas looked into the fish’s diet, which mostly consists of tiny floating zooplankton animals. Papa has put together a team of UST-based researchers to further research Taal zooplankton. In 2011, a team from the UP Diliman Institute of Biology, headed by Jonas Quilang and Brian Santos, did a DNA analysis of the tawilis.

All of these studies provided much-needed data for the environmental planners responsible for the Taal Volcano Protected Landscape (TVPL). Sadly, despite numerous public consultations and symposia, the scientists’ recommendations fell on deaf ears.

The serendipity of red-listing

Then in 2017, their published works were used as the bases for the IUCN assessment that red-listed the tawilis. Mudjekeewis Santos, the principal author, said that the IUCN report merely reiterates the work and advocacy of the Filipino scientists.

Santos, a UP Baguio alumnus and a National Academy of Science and Technology Academician, belongs to the same institution as Mutia. The co-authors of the IUCN assessment include BFAR’s Francisco Torres, a Fisheries alumnus of UP Diliman, and Quilang of the UP Diliman Institute of Biology. They came together during the formation of the Philippine Aquatic Red-List Committee in early 2017.

“By law, we were late [in convening the committee] by seven years or eight years,” Santos adds.

As the Philippine point person for Clupeidae, the family of sardines, Santos headed the assessment of its Philippine species. And this he coordinated with the IUCN global assessment group, which had also been set for sardines. He and his IUCN colleagues had earlier ascertained the marine origins of the tawilis."

It may seem a long time ago for many, but it was only on March 16, 2020 that President Rodrigo Roa Duterte first imposed an enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) on the island of Luzon in response to reports of rising cases of COVID-19. As with many, the women and men of UP Diliman’s Department of Linguistics (DL) felt a heightened urge to provide any meaningful help possible to counter the dire situation.

We felt like we needed to come up with something that would contribute to the efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Prof. Kristina Gallego, a faculty member of DL and currently a PhD candidate at the Australian National University. Assessing how public health information was being disseminated while the virus was spreading, Gallego and her colleagues observed that a great majority of the material produced was communicated in only Filipino and English, to the detriment of many who did not use either language.

Noting the powerful role that language plays in any effort to contain the pandemic and the rise in community translators working on DOH-released information, DL officially launched Language Warriors PH (LWPH) in late March. Dubbed a “meta-translation initiative”, the project aims to connect the disparate community translation projects and “language warriors” across the country that are translating materials related to COVID-19 into the country’s estimated 180 or so languages.

Making connections

Building on recent BA Linguistics graduate Soleil Vinoya’s work done on explaining public hygiene in Philippine languages and tapping into existing networks already actively translating COVID-19 materials, the project members decided that rather than duplicating what was already being done, they could best help by bringing all these initiatives under one roof. “LWPH serves as a platform for these community translators to collaborate, share resources, and get informed about overall translation efforts in the country,” Gallego explained. All these are in service of the broader aim of relaying public health information in languages people use and understand.

One of the project’s most important aims is the creation of a repository of all translated material for easy access, monitoring and dissemination. The group provides frequent status reports on the state of these materials, as well as on individual translators and projects, while connecting the right people to translation jobs where they are needed most.

While Gallego admits that a more thorough study must be done on how equitable the access to government-produced COVID-19 materials has been, the group’s March to May 2020 data revealed that most materials produced on this and other important issues were produced through grassroots efforts. “This clearly shows that the local communities are aware of the need to provide information about the pandemic in the languages the people understand,” Gallego said. While LGUs typically provide information in major Philippine languages, smaller languages are usually left out.

“The communities where these languages are actually spoken are actually the most vulnerable to the pandemic,” Gallego said. “They don’t have access to basic medical facilities, no direct access to news and they lack institutional support in all directions.”

“In addition,” Gallego added, “the Filipino Deaf community is often left in the periphery. New outlets rarely provide FSL interpretations. As a result, some members of the Deaf community were not aware of the implementation of community quarantine procedures in the initial months of quarantine.” She credits one group, FSLACT4COVID, for partly addressing this problem by providing FSL interpretations of new broadcasts on their Facebook page.

The repository

The volunteers of LWPH, who come from a staggering array of backgrounds, have certainly been busy. The is reflected in the group’s material repository, which can be accessed via their Facebook page. As of their May 8, 2020 report, the group had done work in 70 languages, having translated 927 materials in 10 thematic domains, including physical and mental health.

Gallego cites the enthusiasm and activity of their volunteers as the secret behind the considerable material they amassed in such a short period. According to the report, the languages with the highest number of materials include Bikol Sentral (222), Tagalog (143), Hiligaynon (41), Ilocano (37), Cebuano (37), Chavacano de Zamboanga (36), Kapampangan (30), Maguindanaoan (26), Akeanon or Aklanon (26), and Surigaonon (24). Gallego warns, however, that despite its breadth, the repository should not be taken as representative of the collective translation efforts in the country due to difficulties in acquiring material to translate.

As a self-proclaimed dance “fangirl,” she found other venues where she could learn other techniques and dance styles besides her jazz class. “Whenever I went to class at the dance school, I would observe the classes before ours or the dances of the other classes, like modern dance, hip hop, ballet,” Apara shares. “I kept watching dance videos on YouTube as well. And I would take notes, and I would try to recreate or mimic the moves on my own. Ultimately, I found my own groove, which I felt is really more in the neo-ethnic style.”

Her passion for neo-ethnic dance was enhanced when she entered UP Mindanao in 2012. At the time, she had only one goal: to join the UP Mindanao Dance Ensemble (UPMinDE). “I remember it clearly. June 6 was our first day of class then a week or two weeks later, I auditioned for the UPMinDE. The Office of Student Affairs advised us freshmen not to join any orgs yet and to let ourselves adjust to UPMin life. But I was certain: I was going to join that ensemble. So I became a member from 2012 to 2016.”

19 years and counting

The UP Mindanao Dance Ensemble, founded by Prof. Alma Flor M. Brigole, is the resident dance company of UP Mindanao. The UPMinDE or the Ensemble focuses on exploring social commentaries, advocacies and experimental performances through neo-ethnic, contemporary dance and improvisation techniques. It holds yearly full-length dance-concerts, the most recent being “Baylanan” held on May 10, 2018, which celebrated the UPMinDE’s 19th anniversary as a resident company by portraying through dance a story inspired by the life and culture of the baylans or community healers, priests and priestesses.

Apara refined her skills throughout the four years she spent dancing, learning, teaching, training and choreographing with the UPMinDE. In 2016, the year she graduated, she became a finalist in the World Championship for the Performing Arts in Los Angeles, California. She was chosen for her interpretation of a Tausug version of the Pangalay, a traditional dance in Sulu.

Still, the lessons she learned over the course of her journey as a UPMinDE member go beyond dance. Over the years, the UPMinDE has overcome challenges that other UP performing groups have gone through at some point. The experience of overcoming these challenges has instilled within her and her fellow members qualities that prepared them for life, whether onstage or in the real world.

 

Initiative, resourcefulness, and teamwork

One challenge is functioning as a student-driven performing group in UP without an official coach, artistic director or adviser. UPMinDE has gone through times when they had no coach, sometimes lasting years. Apara recalls how hard it was: “It’s very difficult when a varsity team or school organization doesn’t have a coach or adviser. It’s hard to get a budget or to have your proposed events approved because there’s nobody to sign for them. There were times when we got suspended or couldn’t join competitions because having no coach or adviser was not allowed according to the rules.”

During those coach-less years, the UPMinDE’s members found ways to keep on doing what they had to do. “We trained on our own. Whatever techniques each of us learned, we just shared with one another. We just repeated the techniques and ultimately, we even managed to hold a concert.”

Respect for indigenous culture

The UPMinDE is known for its performances that showcase the dances and culture of indigenous people. However, the research that goes behind every piece is just as much a trademark of the Ensemble. This was discipline its founder, Prof. Brigole, instilled in the group.

The Ensemble’s research process includes visiting the communities and immersing themselves in the indigenous culture, learning the dances directly from the tribal members themselves. “Research really plays a big part, because we cannot perform something that is not well-thought of,” Apara says.

After Prof. Brigole left the group around the time of Apara’s freshman year, the UPMinDE shifted more toward modern dance and jazz. “The ethnic spirit was still there, though, so during that time, it was like the Western-style dances and the ethnic dances were kind of mashed up.”

This commitment to indigenous cultures, now combined with touches of the modern, was kept alive by Arch. Gloryrose Dy, herself a UPMinDE alumna, when she became UPMinDE’s coach and artistic director during Apara’s third year in college.

Passing on the torch

Seeing UPMinDE members develop and improve themselves, and seeing the Ensemble explore indigenous cultures and create something new, are things that Apara deeply appreciates, because she’s seen it from both sides. In May 2017, she visited the Ensemble again to give a workshop on contemporary dance. There, she learned that, due to certain circumstances, the group was again falling into that same predicament of having no coach.

“So I applied as coach. Because I was thinking that I should help, in a way, because I know how it felt. That’s why I came back, and I’ve been a coach for over one year now. And I’m still planning to continue,” she says.

Besides coaching the UPMinDE, Apara works as a PR officer in a young advertising agency, and on the occasions when she has to focus on work, she calls on the officers of the UPMinDE to take the lead during practice sessions. This way, she, like Arch. Dy before her, is continuing another long-time tradition of the UPMinDE—training the next generation of leaders.

Looking to the future, the UPMinDE has lined up certain projects, such as joining competitions outside the University, aside from their usual performances in UP Mindanao."

First is the art. Wyndelle Remonde’s works are catchy. Comic. Contemporary.

They would have to be, to be exhibited alongside other urban and edgy works in the annual Moniker Art Fair, which took place in New York in May 2018; and the Coaster Show at La Luz de Jesus Gallery in LA in mid-2017.

Then the appreciation intensifies with knowledge of how, from province and poverty, they came to be. The number one metanarrative of Remonde’s art actually and graphically recurs in his works, consisting of the head of the carabao, as in kayod-kalabaw; and an anatomical heart, puso.

These are very local icons presented to the world by the struggling artist, in jarring self-imagery within the world of his art.

 

A life of struggle

“I started using the symbol when I went back to school for a bachelor’s degree, for my thesis. I was a working student, supporting myself and my family. It was a very difficult time,” he says.

“There was Papa and my two younger siblings. Mama had died. My father was a casual government employee, until he got laid off. He became a tricycle driver. Mama, when she was alive, sold food at the school.”

 

Entry for the Joya Art Awards
(Posted on March 17, 2014

Remonde earned money designing and selling shirts, doing commissioned work, joining art and design contests, penetrating Cebu’s pop-underground scene where his bizarre comic style found an audience.

All the while, he struggled to develop his works to become truly an art form and to be appreciated as such. “My style is a product of blood and tears. I came up with it after several years of working it out. That is why now, I do not compromise my style.”

 

Precocious years

The years began with a child in Argao town, Cebu, finding escape from life’s difficulties in cartoons, which he would himself draw with skills he derived from a self-taught father. His father’s realistic and pragmatic style must have left the young Wyndelle with the notion that his art was not as serious. It must have been a proud moment for him to be recognized in high school for his talent for cartooning, which found an outlet in the editorial page of the school paper.

Yet, while still in UP Cebu for a certificate course in Fine Arts Major in Painting, cartooning took a back seat, as UP gave him the opportunity to explore mediums and other styles. And of course, nobody in Painting school did cartoons, and he did not do cartoons in UP until he earned his certificate. But when he set out for the outside world, the opportunities offered by companies—graphic, animation, book illustration, and design—called for comics.

One thousand three hundred kilometers from the airconditioned halls of the Batasang Pambansa is an open-air barangay gymnasium jampacked with hundreds of members from a Lumad community. This is where Chad Errol Booc, a volunteer teacher for high school students in the Alternative Learning Center for Agricultural and Livelihood Development (ALCADEV), has been staying for almost a week prior to the president’s state of the nation address (SONA). Their community fled the agricultural school, which is also a boarding school, due to continued threats from the military presence in their areas.

ALCADEV was established in 2004 as an “alternative learning system especially designed to provide secondary education to indigent indigenous youth from the Manobo, Higaonon, Banwaon, Talandig, and Mamanwa” in the Surigao and Agusan provinces comprising CARAGA. Academic courses are taught in a way as to include vocational and technical skills, often rooted in agricultural traditions in their respective communities. The need for establishing schools arose when Lumad leaders realized how education could shield them from abuse. In the past, they were tricked into signing spurious contracts which gave away their ancestral land for a few cans of sardines. It was when the Tribal Filipino Program of Surigao del Sur was created, which then gave birth to ALCADEV.

Hailing from the College of Engineering in Diliman, Chad earned his Computer Science degree cum laude and was recognized for his undergraduate research project which he had presented in academic forums abroad. He was cut out for a corporate life just like most of his peers. But exactly five SONAs ago, he joined a rally for the first time and began seeing other realities and possibilities.

Chad became an activist and found himself in the middle of Manilakbayan 2015 on the eve of the killing of the ALCADEV executive director at that time. “I witnessed how the Lumad stood up as a tribe for self-governance and self-determination. The fact that they built and ran their own school without our help, even if we are deemed more educated because we finished college,” he recalls. This encounter inspired and challenged him at the same time; and after graduating, he veered off the corporate track and finally decided to volunteer in Mindanao in 2016.

He chose ALCADEV because, prior to graduation, he had the chance to integrate with the community for several weeks. It was particularly difficult explaining the decision to his family. But through several Facebook posts and even more hours patiently sharing his firsthand struggles and adventures with his worried family, he finally made progress. His choice appealed to the humanitarian sensibilities of his parents, both active members of their church. Serving the oppressed and marginalized was a value they shared.

Shaping the future of Philippine forensics"
UP and the Ins-and-Outs of the Data Privacy Act: Interview with DPO Atty. Gaby Fernandez – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/up-and-the-ins-and-outs-of-the-data-privacy-act-interview-with-dpo-atty-gaby-fernandez/,"


Atty. Marcia Ruth Gabriela Fernandez, UP System Data Protection Officer (DPO), and the DPOs of the constituent universities have a complicated job: helping UP, an institution mandated under its Charter to teach, do research and generate and disseminate knowledge and provide public service, to navigate Republic Act No. 10173 or the Data Privacy Act (DPA) of 2012.

Fernandez notes that a common misconception of the DPA is that consent of the data subject is needed to process information all the time. The law lists several conditions or cases, aside from consent, where personal information can be processed. Personal information may be processed (i.e., collected, used, stored, etc.) when needed to comply with a legal obligation, to protect the vital interests of the data subject to life and health, to respond to national emergency, and to fulfill the functions of public authority. Sensitive personal information (i.e., confidential education records, age, civil status, health information) may be processed, for example, when allowed by law. Regulatory enactments provide for the following: to protect such information, and the consent of the data subject is not required for such processing; to protect the life and health of the data subject or another person when the data subject cannot physically or legally express consent, and when needed for medical treatment subject to conditions; and, to protect lawful rights and interests of natural and legal persons in the exercise or defense of legal claims and where these are provided to public authority.

“It is possible for UP to invoke, in applicable cases, our mandate under the Constitution and the UP Charter to exercise the right and responsibility of academic freedom as our lawful basis for processing personal and sensitive personal information,” Fernandez said. The DPA itself also provides for exemptions from the applicability of the DPA such as when the processing of information is necessary in order to carry out the functions of public authority and personal information processed for journalistic, artistic, literary or research purposes. Still, the law itself is complex, and the UP community needs to know how to traverse it.

UP researchers and the DPA

With the penalty of imprisonment as well as hefty fines for the punishment of various acts or omissions involved, the DPA can feel like a sword hanging over the heads of UP researchers, especially for those in the social sciences, who often use approaches that may or may not involve written, electronic or recorded consent. Fernandez herself, before her appointment as DPO, pointed out in position papers she submitted to the National Privacy Commission (NPC) in her personal capacity the dysfunctional unintended consequences of a too narrow interpretation of the DPA that requires written, electronic or recorded consent in all instances from research participants for the processing of sensitive personal information. This could be used by groups or agencies with ulterior motives to force researchers to divulge their research participants’ personal data under threat of jail time and/or other penalties.

“That’s why I said, such an interpretation of the DPA could have a chilling effect,” Fernandez said. “We have to go back to the spirit, the purpose behind the law. The law recognizes that while the State has the duty to protect the right to privacy of individuals, the State must also promote the free flow of information by upholding other Constitutional rights and freedoms.”

There are laws and issuances that UP researchers can invoke to lawfully process sensitive personal information under Section 13b of the DPA. These include the Philippine Statistical Act, the Philippine National Health Research System (PNHRS) Act, and the National Ethical Guidelines on Health and Health Related Research (NEGHHR). The NEGHHR, which was issued pursuant to the PNHRS Act, provides for instances when research ethics committees (RECs) or research ethics boards (REBs) may waive the requirement of informed consent, as in the case of archival research or naturalistic observation, or alter some of the requirements of informed consent, such as waiving the requirement of a signed consent form.

Noting that the Philippine Health Research Ethics Board, which was established pursuant to the PNHRS Act, allows for several REBs or RECs in one academic unit, Fernandez recommended that constituent universities that have yet to establish REBs or RECs consider the creation of RECs at the college level, considering the diverse range of disciplines throughout the UP System. “It is really our duty, as the national university and as a research institution, to uphold research ethics, which requires among others the protection of the privacy of research participants and the establishment of research ethics committees or boards.”

UP students and the DPA

The UP System has a privacy notice (https://www.up.edu.ph/index.php/university-of-the-philippines-up-privacy-notice-foi/) informing UP students on what personal and sensitive personal information will be collected from them, for what purpose, the legal basis for processing such information, as well as measures adopted by UP to safeguard the same. Students are asked to indicate on their Form-5s that they have read the notice, recognize the authority of UP to process such information, and give their consent.

The notice also informs students that UP will disclose their personal and sensitive personal information when required or allowed by applicable laws or with their consent. For example, the notice states that UP may disclose a student’s personal and sensitive personal information to their family or next of kin to promote the student’s best interests as required by law; when necessary to respond to an emergency, to uphold the student’s vitally important interests including her/his life and health or to prevent harm to her/him and/or others; or with the student’s consent. UP recognizes that there are cases where the student may be struggling with a serious condition or has become suicidal or his or her life is in jeopardy.

It was a nail-biter reminiscent of last season’s finals bid: the UP Fighting Maroons head to head with the Adamson University Soaring Falcons. Last year’s semifinals saw UP snatching the finals spot away from Adamson, knocking away its twice-to-beat advantage in what was arguably the two most exciting games of Season 81 of the University Athletics Association of the Philippines (UAAP) men’s basketball tournament.

In their much anticipated first meeting in Season 82, UP’s Bright Akhuetie and prized recruit Kobe Paras rallied the Fighting Maroons to victory in overtime, 83-82.

Akhuetie filed his second double-double of the season with 18 points and 18 rebounds, while the debuting Paras successfully emerged from his baptism of fire with 20 markers and six boards. Save for Juan Gomez de Liaño’s one trip to the line, Akhuetie and Paras received the most charity chances. Both also clocked in the longest playing times among the UP squad this season, with Paras playing for 41:05 and Akhuetie for 34:38.

The tight first quarter saw the Maroons ahead with the first lead change of the match happening in the last few minutes, ending with a two-point deficit for UP at 18-20. Six of those points were off David Murrell’s field goals, six from Paras’s basket and free throws, four from Akhuetie’s field goal and charities, and two courtesy of Jun Manzo’s basket.

But Adamson was hell-bent on widening the gap in the next quarter. One-and-done Falcon guard Val Chauca surely made his presence felt by banking 15 of his team’s 21 points: nine points from three treys, four from two inside the arc, and two from the line. UP struggled against Adamson’s 11-0 run in the second half of the quarter, with only one inside shot by Akhuetie and one of two free throws from Paras. The team from Diliman trailed by 16 at the end of the first half, 25-41.

As if the double-digit damage to UP wasn’t enough, Adamson veteran Jerrick Ahanmisi shot two, less than 30 seconds into the third quarter, marking the biggest lead in the game at 18. But the Fighting Maroons weren’t about to take it lightly.

Whatever happened in the Maroon dugout during half-time was the much needed shot in the arm as UP retaliated with three runs after Ahanmisi’s basket: 9-0, 7-0, and 6-0, with the in-betweens accounting for only three Adamson points. Less than two minutes remaining, Falcon AP Manlapaz stopped UP’s run with a two-pointer, only to be answered by Paras’s inside shot. Adamson center Lenda Douanga sank another basket before Juan Gomez de Liaño’s trey sealed the deal for UP to end the third quarter with a two-point lead, 52-50.

Heart-stopping would be one of the best ways to describe the last quarter, with five deadlocks and six lead changes across the last ten minutes of regulation time. UP’s James Spencer kicked things off with a three-point shot a few seconds in and Adamson replied with a 7-0 run. With 22 seconds left and the team from Ermita up by three, Paras drove to the basket against three Falcons as fellow Maroon Javi Gomez de Liaño ran outside the arc. As if guided by a sixth sense, Paras executed a smooth no-look pass to the UP forward who was free to take the three-pointer. With 17.8 seconds remaining and 10 left in the shot clock, Gomez de Liaño’s trey slid into the ring to tie the game. With no answer from Adamson, the match went into overtime.

Key scientific capabilities and projects of UP Cebu, offering solutions to pressing threats and problems in the region, such as water-related disasters, fires, emerging vector-borne diseases, water scarcity, and internet vulnerability, were presented to local media on April 26, 2019 at the Performance Arts Hall on campus.

“Did you know that after the Naga landslide which was said to [have] one of the fastest search and retrieval operations in a disaster, UP Cebu’s LIDAR and CENVI were there?” UP Cebu Chancellor Liza Corro said in welcoming media representatives, as she referred to a UP Cebu environmental informatics team, whose quick mappings of the landslide site in the neighboring city right after the disaster facilitated search and retrieval operations.

“This was one of the best examples of science being applied in the real world. All our researches here are really more of solutions for real problems,” Corro emphasized.

The UP Cebu team, employing LIDAR, which stands for Light Detection and Ranging, a remote sensing method using light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure variable distances to the Earth, was able to pinpoint the location of structures buried under the Naga City, Cebu landslide debris. It is one of the expertise of CENVI or the Central Visayas Center for Environmental Informatics of UP Cebu.

Among the 383 members of UP Cebu Class of 2019 who marched onstage to receive their diplomas at UP Cebu’s 82nd Commencement Exercises held at the campus in the afternoon of June 28, 2019, one stood out because of her absence.

Ms. Kis Tryvl Cabasag Ramos, who would have graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology alongside the rest of her batchmates, was fatally shot on April 11 along with two of her workmates and the café proprietor at a coffee shop on F. Ramos Street in Cebu City where she worked.

Two months later, her parents, Mrs. Elvira Ramos and Mr. Juan Reynaldo Ramos, who himself graduated from the UP Diliman Institute of Social Work and Community Development, marched onto the stage to receive the diploma on their daughter’s behalf, amid bittersweet cheers and applause from her fellow graduates, UP Cebu officials and faculty, and the audience.

Later in his speech on behalf of the graduates, BS Computer Science, magna cum laude graduate, and Class of 2019 valedictorian Juan Carlos “Jace” Tabacon Roldan gave a touching tribute to Kis, a former student leader and writer for UP Cebu’s official student publication, Tug-ani: “I would like to acknowledge one who had yearned and fought and shone despite the tyranny she had bravely stood against: our friend and kauban, Kis Tryvl Ramos, who is with us in militant spirit today. She had had a chance to touch the souls of many in this University, and she deserves a seat alongside us, just as much as the rest.”

Roldan urged his fellow UP graduates to continue to work and fight for the poor, the marginalized and the oppressed minorities, especially after they have learned how to foster righteous indignation and cultivate an understanding of society in UP. “We have been asked to make the profitable choice. . . but the logic in the gears of the iskolar ng bayan is not predicated upon the blind search for more. The algorithm or blueprint for being iskolar ng bayan does not dictate making choices simply towards seeking prestige in the fields of industry or in the academe. Being iskolar ng bayan is in the realization that the struggle in here is a part of the struggle out there and making the correct choice to fight alongside it.”

UP Cebu Chancellor Liza D. Corro prefaced Roldan’s call to the graduates in her opening remarks by referring to UP Cebu’s slogan, nurtured to create, inspired to innovate, destined to serve, printed across the backdrop of the stage. “It is just fitting that before you start going out to the real world, you all remind yourselves that we in UP are a sui generis. Many may not understand why there are rallies in UP, even during commencement. Actually, what we do here is not so much for others to know but it is more of a reminder to all of you, our dear graduates, and to us in UP, that service is what we are destined for.”

UP Cebu Class of 2019 produced 70 honor graduates. Five were magna cum laude graduates and 64, cum laude graduates, while one graduate student who earned a Master of Education degree was recognized Most Outstanding Graduate.

Gracing the occasion as commencement speaker was Executive Vice President Maria Luisa Aboitiz Booth of Mehitabel, Inc., which is one of the Philippines’ most prominent members of the furniture-making industry and one of Cebu’s most enduring institutions.

Booth shared four simple truths and guiding principles that she thought would be helpful to them, truths she learned, not when she graduated from college or law school in the US, but during the course of her life.

UP Cebu FireCheck develops CoVcheck – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/up-cebu-firecheck-develops-covcheck/,"


 

The FireCheck Project team and the University of the Philippines Cebu have developed CoVcheck, a web-based application that allows the local government to collect data from its constituents about cases or potential cases of infection. By doing so, the concerned agencies – health units, disaster management offices among others, may be able to respond to the community’s needs as soon as necessary. On top of that, with the collected data, the local government can plan and execute localized, ad hoc measures to control or contain transmission or support the affected communities. The application shall also serve as a hub for disseminating information to concerned communities and several other future interactions with response units.

The platform includes the following functions:

Reporting of Potential Infection (Self or others) —

The residents will have a way of reporting to the local government if they, a relative or a neighbor, are potentially infected by COVID19. By doing so, the local government will have an overview of the potential mass of infection and identify mitigating actions to reduce risk or mobility in certain locations. In addition, the immediate response through medication or other means may be designated whenever and wherever it will be needed. By default, residents are encouraged to stay in their homes. With the need to go to designated hospitals in the city center for testing and/or medical consultation, the potential for transmission is increased.

Self-assessment —

Users will be able to assess themselves if they already need medical attention or not. This function hopes to reduce the number of patients who unnecessarily go to the hospitals to be checked. The risk of getting infected or infecting others may be reduced."

The ANTENA Consortium, of which UP is a member, held the ANTENA Project’s First National Round Table and Coordination Meeting on July 15 and 16 at De La Salle University (DLSU) Manila.

The ANTENA Project is an initiative on the internationalization of Philippine higher education institutions (HEIs), coordinated by the Oficina de Gestión de Proyectos Internacionales (International Project Management Office) of the Universidad de Alicante (UA), Spain. It is co-funded by the European Commission through the Erasmus+ Program.

The two-day event succeeded the ANTENA launch and initial meeting of partners held at UA from February 26 to March 1.

A highlight of the event’s opening program was the Ateneo de Manila University’s (ADMU) presentation of initial findings from the national survey it conducted on internationalization in and of Philippine HEIs. It had 103 respondents.

ADMU School of Management-Business Resource Center Director John Luis Lagdameo pointed out the top four barriers to mobility in three sectors: student, faculty, and administration and staff. The biggest challenge in all sectors was insufficient financial support. Administrative and bureaucratic difficulties also hindered mobility for all three.

Limited interest and involvement, as well as lack of foreign language skills, were also barriers to student and faculty mobility. For administration and staff mobility, other barriers included in the top four were limited technical support and lack of organizational development.

To highlight the importance of having a gender responsive early childhood care and development (ECCD) program for women’s empowerment and gender equality, and in fulfillment of the role of interior designers to address practical concerns of Filipinos, BS Interior Design students of the University of the Philippines College of Home Economics (UP CHE), together with the UP Center for Women’s and Gender Studies (UP CWGS) and the UP CHE faculty, sponsors of the renovation project, and guests, marked the opening of the newly renovated Kalinga Day Care Center (KDCC) in UP Diliman, Quezon City, with a ribbon-cutting ceremony and guided tour of the facility on January 10, 2020.

UP’s Atty. Gaby Concepcion and Justice Marvic Leonen; Dr. Sylvia Guerrero, Dr. Nathalie Verceles, and Dr. Excelsa Tongson of UP CWGS; and, Dr. Adelaida Mayo, Prof. Hanna Faustino, and Prof. Pamela Aquino of UP CHE led the ceremonial cutting of the ribbon to open the improved KDCC facility to its constituents.

Interior designer and faculty adviser Pamela Aquino introduced the ten BS ID students responsible for renovating KDCC’s reception area, teachers’ room, recreation area, kitchen, storage, and toilet: Dana Sangalang (project head); Erielle Ekong (quality control & site coordinator); Gaille Marquez (secretariat & procurement); Clement Ignacio (design head); Rizza Tabios (procurement & quality control); Steffi Yuquimpo (finance head & design co-head); Mikee Arevalo (CAD operator & procurement); Catherine Asejo (site coordinator & quality control); Angela Titular (externals & publicity co-head); and, Sophia Teaño (externals & publicity co-head). New furnishing and two additional spaces, the dining area and the breastfeeding room were also provided to KDCC through the project.

Prof. Tongson turned over to Prof. Aquino and the students the letter of appreciation written by the children enrolled in KDCC.

Prof. Tongson provided a background on how the KDCC started, and encouraged everybody to take a look at the KDCC whole-day and half-day programs and to put up their own day care centers in public or private offices. She explained that the day care primarily caters to the needs of the children of UP employees and students so that they, as parents, may be able to pursue their interests and participate in nation building.

The KDCC opened in 1998 and is fully managed by the UP CWGS as a non-formal, non-structured alternative learning environment which aims to provide a comfortable, gender-fair, and safe environment for children from ages 1 to 5 years old, and to promote a positive self-concept in children. KDCC also provides parents, guardians and caregivers or yayas with gender-responsive seminars on childhood care and development, laws, and other women’s and gender related issues.

According to the BS ID students who completed the project, “the opportunity to renovate KDCC was brought about by ID 179: Special Project in Interior Design.” This course is taken by graduating BS ID students to engage them in a real-world scenario or provide them a glimpse of what they may expect of professional life. It involves the class in meticulous planning, designing, execution, and post-evaluation of the project for a chosen beneficiary.

UP CHE Department of Clothing, Textiles and Interior Design (CTID) Chairperson Faustino provided more details on the project. She said ID students used to hold exhibits in malls to showcase their skills until the start of 2000.

The University of the Philippines Center for Women’s Studies (UPCWGS), the UP Center for Women’s Studies Foundation, Inc., and the Angat Buhay: Partnerships Against Poverty program of the Office of Vice President Maria Leonor “Leni” Robredo, with the support of the Canada Fund for Local Initiatives of the Embassy of Canada, launched the second Angat Bayi Women’s Political Empowerment Program.

The Angat Bayi Women’s Political Empowerment Program, which was piloted in 2018, is a comprehensive women’s political empowerment program that aims to contribute to the full, meaningful, and effective political participation of women towards a people-centered, rights-based, gender-responsive, participatory, empowering and sustainable development agenda.

The opening ceremony and welcome reception for the Angat Bayi program’s Fellows for 2020-2021 was held on February 19, 2020, at the Quezon City Reception House in New Manila. As with the first batch of 2018-2019, the Angat Bayi’s Fellows include women leaders from various levels of local governments and from various cities, municipals and provinces across the different regions of the Philippines. Under the program, they will undergo four days of intensive training in feminist and gender transformative leadership, including online courses, sessions with feminist leadership mentors, and insight-sharing from fellow women political leaders and past Angat Bayi Fellows.

Aside from the 21 new Angat Bayi Fellows, attendees included: UP System and UP Diliman officials; officials, former directors, researchers and staff of the UPCWGS; members of Vice President Robredo’s media and Angat Buhay project team; and, members of the media.

Through the UPCWGS, Tamayo’s dream became a full-fledged women’s political empowerment project through the support of the Canadian Embassy, the Office of the Vice President, and Certified-edu.net, which hosts the program’s online courses.

The first two of five batches of COVID-19 test kits from the Apl.de.Ap Foundation International (ADAFI), the UP Alumni Association of San Francisco, Inc. (UPAASF), and UP alumnus and entrepreneur Yobie Benjamin have arrived at the University.

The Grammy-winning artist Apl.de.Ap, founding member of the hip hop group Black Eyed Peas, and chairman of ADAFI, officially turned over the donation to UP President Danilo L. Concepcion, UP-PGH Director Gerardo D. Legaspi, and TVUP Executive Director Gigi Javier-Alfonso.

The donation is the culmination of many months of massive efforts coordinated by US-based Mr. Ted Benito, Executive Director of the ADAFI, and Ms. Sonia Delen, ADAFI Board Director and immediate past president of the UPAASF.

The boxes containing DNA/RNA Shield™ Saliva Collection Kits, manufactured by Zymo Research Corporation, are currently housed in the newly constructed warehouse of the UP System Supply and Property Management Office in the Diliman campus. The boxes contain 131,000 COVID-19 test kits altogether, representing a partial shipment of the 227,722 test kits, worth US$2.85 million, donated to UP. The three remaining containers of test kits will arrive on or before March 18.

Opportunity to expand services

In his brief remarks, UP President Concepcion expressed his appreciation for the presence of Apl.de.Ap and the donation of the COVID-19 test kits. He officially accepted the gift during his meeting with UP alumni in San Francisco, California on December 10, 2021.

“Thank you very much from the bottom of our hearts, from the Filipino people and UP,” he said.

UP PGH Director Legaspi also thanked Apl.de.Ap, Benjamin, ADAFI, and UPAASF for “giving us this opportunity to expand our services to our patients.”

“The plan is to expand this [COVID-testing service] to the whole UP community,” Legaspi said in his message during the turnover of the newly arrived first batch of testing kits. These kits will facilitate the immediate preparation of UP students for their gradual return to limited face-to-face instruction and practical academic work in laboratories and related facilities.

Related news: UP faculty discusses return to face-to-face classes this semester

Legaspi also commended the timeliness of the arrival of the first batch of COVID-19 test kits since the UP PGH has just recently received certification from the Department of Health (DOH) to conduct saliva-based Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing. With this, the UP PGH has become one of few institutions, including the Philippine Red Cross and the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, allowed by the DOH to conduct such testing.

“Saliva-testing has become a more convenient screening method for our patients as well as our students and faculty who will come in. It has also brought down the cost of testing from Php1200 to around Php300-400 per test, making it even more affordable and available to a lot of our constituents,” Legaspi said as he reiterated his gratitude for the donation."

From genotype shift to HIV epidemic – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/from-genotype-shift-to-hiv-epidemic/,"From genotype shift to HIV epidemic
April 6, 2018 | Written by Fred Dabu



Reports indicate that HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infections in the Philippines have reached epidemic proportions.

Source: Department of Health (2018). HIV/AIDS and ART Registry of the Philippines: January 2018. Department of Health, Epidemiology Bureau, Manila, Philippines. Available at: http://www.aidsdatahub.org/sites/default/files/publication/Philippines_HIV_January_AIDSreg2018.pdf [Accessed April 6, 2018].

 

The HIV/AIDS & ART Registry of the Philippines (HARP) revealed that 1,021 new HIV-infected individuals were reported in January 2018, of which 17% of the newly diagnosed already showed signs of advanced HIV infection. With patients’ ages ranging from 3 to 61 years old, more than half of the newly tested were 25 to 34 years old, and 29 percent were 15 to 24 years old.

Available at: http://www.aidsdatahub.org/sites/default/files/publication/Philippines_HIV_January_AIDSreg2018.pdf [Accessed April 6, 2018].

 

According to the same report, “About one-third (327 individuals) was from the National Capital Region. 87% (885 individuals) of newly diagnosed infections was among males who have sex with males. Other modes of transmission were needle sharing among injecting drug users (18 individuals) and mother-to-child transmission (two individuals).”

 

Dealing with the HIV epidemic

Dr. Edsel Maurice T. Salvaña, director of the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), University of the Philippines Manila, said that although the prevalence of HIV infections has gone down by 25 percent in most parts of the world, HIV in the Philippines has gone up by more than 25 percent in the last ten years.

 

TED Fellow Dr. Edsel Salvaña describes the aggressive HIV subtype AE that’s currently plaguing his home of the Philippines—and warns us about what might become a global epidemic.

 

“It is now the fastest-growing HIV epidemic in the world,” Salvaña said during the scientific conference hosted by the NIH at the Bayanihan Center, Pasig City on March 14. He explained that the majority of infections from 2006 to present was locally transmitted, and that the epidemic is attributed to a shift in HIV genotype, “from subtype B to what looks like a more aggressive subtype CRFo1_AE (AE, for short), which is not a new subtype, but is more common in Thailand and other parts of Southeast Asia.” This genotype shift was discovered through research at the NIH.

“It’s now a local epidemic, and the trajectory is quite alarming. In 2000, we only had one new case every three days. In 2007, only one case a day. In 2009, we had two new cases a day. Now, we have 31 cases a day,” Salvaña said. There have been 10,111 reported cases from January to November 2017, or more than 50,000 since 1984 when the first case of HIV in the Philippines was reported.

According to Salvaña, there has been “a 30-fold increase in the past decade. Nearly 85 percent of those cases were newly diagnosed in the last five years. If we compare the new cases from 2001-2015, the number of cases worldwide has gone down by 32 percent, but in the Philippines, it has gone up by 4,800 percent, to the point that we now have the fastest growing HIV epidemic in Asia and the world, in terms of percentage.”

The subtype AE is more aggressive and more transmissible, as illustrated by Salvaña. “This is partially responsible for the explosion of cases in the Philippines. Before the year 2000, about 71 percent were subtype B (the subtype that is more common in the US and Europe), and now it’s 75 percent subtype AE and about 22 percent subtype B. The most common subtype in the world is C, which represents about 50 percent of cases in the world, and most of that is in Africa. Whereas subtype B, the most studied subtype, only represents about 12 percent of the world’s HIV population,” he said.

Salvaña further said that an explosive epidemic in the Philippines because of a genotype shift could have global implications. He added that subtype AE infections were also emerging in other countries, including the US, Canada, and Australia, and that the problem might become more complicated due to drug resistance.

 

NIH’s role vs. HIV

Dr. Salvaña said the NIH provides important scientific evidence for policy and helps us understand, “and potentially defeat the HIV epidemic.” He added that “NIH is currently doing research on the molecular epidemiology and emergence of drug-resistant HIV. We have collaborated with the Department of Health (DOH) in determining rates of drug resistance to antiretrovirals.”

“Research geared towards supporting policy has always been the guiding principle for our HIV work in NIH. We looked at prevalence of HIV in special populations and described the changing molecular epidemiology of HIV in the Philippines, leading us to discover that the shift in HIV genotype is a major factor in the current epidemic. In addition, we were the first to do a systematic study on the emergence of drug resistance on treatment, and we are currently doing work on transmission of HIV drug resistance which is essential to long-term planning for HIV control and elimination efforts,” Salvaña reiterated.

The research efforts of the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology focus on the prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment of the top causes of sickness and death in the country. The NIH offers a variety of cutting-edge services, among them HIV drug resistance testing, genotyping, and research on other disease-causing bacteria and viruses.

 

Get tested, get proper treatment

“This is no longer something to be scared of,” Salvaña said, as he encouraged people to get tested for HIV. He said earlier diagnosis means better response to medication, and longer life.

Antiretroviral Therapy increases the survival rate in HIV patients. “With treatment, you can live a long and full life. After an unprecedented global effort in research and aid, effective medication was discovered. Turning point came with the discovery of protease inhibitors, and the use of HAART, or High Active Antiretroviral Therapy). Our HAART is a combination of three drugs. The people who use it don’t die of HIV. Most of the data generated on the effect of Antiretroviral Therapy is abroad, but we do have local data here at the NIH. If you are diagnosed with full-blown AIDS, you are six times more likely to die. So you really want to get diagnosed early,” Salvaña said.

“Being on treatment reduces risk of transmission by 96 %. New data suggests that if your viral load is suppressed, which we expect after six months of taking your treatment, your risk of transmitting HIV is zero. Undetectable equals untransmissible. Treatment restores your health for you to be able to do the things you used to do. You do not put your loved ones at further risk,” concluded Dr. Salvaña.

The UP System consulted UP offices that deal directly with students and student organizations in the first phase of a “gender mainstreaming” effort for the entire University.

In a workshop organized by the UP Padayon Public Service Office (PPSO) on April 29 and 30, 2019 at the UP Diliman (UPD) Institute of Small Scale Industries, the UP Technical Working (TWG) on Gender Sensitivity and Equality consulted with the constituent unit (CU) offices of student affairs, the registrar, gender, housing, health service, counseling and guidance, anti-sexual harassment, and student councils.

Instituted by UP President Danilo Concepcion, the TWG is chaired by Jeanette Yasol-Naval of the PPSO, with the following members: Assistant Vice President for Student Affairs Richard Philip Gonzalo; UP Center for Women’s and Gender Studies (CWGS) Director Nathalie Africa-Verceles; CWGS Deputy Director for Training and Outreach Excelsa Tongson; UPD Registrar Ma. Theresa Payongayong; UPD Office of Anti-Sexual Harassment (OASH) Coordinator Nancy Kimuell-Gabriel; UPD Gender Office Coordinator Teresa Paula de Luna; and, UPD Asian Center’s Maria Dulce Natividad.

Currently, the CWGS is at the helm of implementing the Gender Guidelines and Anti-Sexual Harassment (ASH) Code of the University, and the development of programs and the coordination of efforts at gender mainstreaming, according to Vice President for Academic Affairs Cynthia Bautista in a message read by TWG member Verceles.

Yasol-Naval said, “The TWG was primarily tasked to further craft programs and recommend policies that will continue promoting gender sensitivity and responsiveness among students and student organizations.”

“We are now in the initial phase, which is the consultative workshop. The second one is the system-wide training of trainers on gender mainstreaming. The third one is the GST [gender sensitivity training] caravan where we will bring the training to the constituent universities,” Yasol-Naval added.

Cebu’s fab fablab – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/cebus-fab-fablab/,"Cebu’s fab fablab

There’s a growing space in the world for a growing community of “makers.” Makers are those who transform the virtual into actual physical objects. They “make” in a network of laboratories specifically equipped for rapid fabrication, thus, “fablabs.”

A new member of this global network, and among very few fablabs in the Philippines, the UP Cebu FabLab has made its presence felt since opening in September 2016. A project of the University and the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), supported by the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), it is doing what it set out to do: people the booming industries of Cebu with digital creatives able to convert their designs into solid reality.

UP Cebu Fablab enables those creatives with fablab basic services: laser cutting, desktop and large CNC (computer numerical control) milling, 3D printing, large-format printing, and vinyl cutting. It has two conference rooms with Wi-fi: one equipped with 15 computer units with 3D modeling and design software.

On top of these physical features is the laboratory’s young but already cherished tradition of openness. “I know for sure there are some companies who have machines like these: the typical tarpaulin printer machine, laser cutters, and this CNC. But they are privately owned. What we provide here is democratic access to these machines,” UP Cebu Fablab manager Jay Nathan Jore says.

“And it’s a kind of a one-stop shop,” he adds, as he emphasizes the training the facility also provides on fabrication and the use of the machines.

One is hard put to call it a “laboratory.” Jore would rather call it “makerspace,” a “communal space” open to makers in the region where there had been none.

One comes in and is greeted cordially by teachers, staff, and a cardboard T-Rex as tall as a human. A shelf presents rows of curios and collectibles. At the farther end of the main hall is a quirky lounge set and a CNC-shaped conference table. Beside it, an arcade game console is ready to be played. All are prototypes fabricated in-house. Walk-in guests get a rush of ideas and possibilities.

They comprise the majority of the clientele: enthusiasts from outside UP, and micro, small, and medium enterprises in the region. The 30-percent student clientele mostly come from other universities, to include medical students 3D-printing brain, parts of the spinal column, and teeth for visualization.

“We are one center that can bring students from different universities—competing universities—together and to work together. In one weekend there were students from San Carlos, from San Jose Recoletos, from others, who all wanted to have something done in the Fablab. It was fun seeing them together,” Jore says, adding that students are given discounts on the already cheap rates.

“People would come: entrepreneurs one day, artists and designers the next, and engineers or architects on another. We know these engagements would germinate things we could not by ourselves [in UP Cebu].”

The Fablab has served 350 individuals as of October 2017, germinating 25 to 30 product prototypes a month. These include scale models of buildings, trophies, electronics, and prize-winning entries to design contests by UP Cebu students. Apparel, fashion accessories, shoes and bags developed by UP Cebu students from scrap and salvaged wood in the Fablab won this year’s “Green Fashion Revolution.”"

The University of the Philippines, through the Padayon Public Service Office or UP Padayon, is working for the advancement of the Manila Bay rehabilitation.

The academic as well as public service initiatives of the various colleges across the UP system have aided key national government agencies in the bid to make Manila Bay sustainable. UP Padayon has forged a network of resources that will further mainstream the contributions of UP’s academic, research and public service efforts toward Manila Bay’s rehabilitation.

“This consolidation is necessary as it enables us to see the comprehensiveness of UP’s involvement in addressing Manila Bay’s systemic rehabilitation,” Padayon Director Jeanette L. Yasol-Naval said.

From community to scholarship engagement

Since April, the UP Diliman National Service Training Program (NSTP) has partnered with the Philippine Coast Guard Auxiliary (PCGA) in conducting an awareness campaign, “Sikhay Lingkod 2: A Summit on Volunteerism,” which featured grassroots initiatives and advocacies, especially in maritime and environmental protection, as well as the Manila Bay clean-up drive.

The UP budget in the NEP 2022 explained – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/the-up-budget-in-the-nep-2022-explained/,"


In the recently presented National Expenditure Program (NEP) for Fiscal Year 2022, the University of the Philippines (UP) has been given a total budget of P20.174B. According to the UP Office of the Vice President for Planning and Finance (UP OVPPF), this represents a decrease of 6%, amounting to P1.329 billion, compared to its allotment in the General Appropriations Act (GAA) of 2021 of P21.503B.

The decreases in the UP budget are seen mainly in its Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE), which went down by 11%, and in its Capital Outlay (CO) by 70%. On the other hand, Personal Services (PS) saw an increase of 6% or P780M. This is generally attributed to the rise in basic salary due to the Salary Standardization Law (SSL).

 

From the “Highlights of the NEP 2022 of the University of the Philippines System” produced by the UP OVPPF

 

Funding for the PGC and PGH

The CO is appropriations for goods and services whose benefits would extend beyond the fiscal year. Many Locally Funded Projects involving capital outlay in the GAA 2021 are no longer given budget in the NEP 2022. The new CO projects included in the NEP 2022, totaling P601M, are the construction of the Food Processing Research and Development Center Building and rehabilitation of the Dairy Building of Dairy Training Research Institute (DTRI), both in UP Los Baños, and equipment for the second phase of the Philippine Genomic Information and Resource Hub, under the UP System.

The budget allotted for the UP Philippine General Hospital (UP PGH) in the NEP 2022, on the other hand, is P5.666B, which is an 18% decrease from the GAA 2021’s P6.872B. As with the rest of the UP System, there is an increase of P127.7M or 5% in the PS for the UP PGH due to the SSL’s rise in salary. The UP PGH’s MOOE faces a decrease of 4% or P130M due to various initiatives provided for in the GAA 2021 no longer being included in the NEP 2022.

Math + culture for indigenous peoples – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/math-culture-for-indigenous-people/,"Math + culture for indigenous peoples
October 5, 2017 | Written by Celeste Ann Castillo Llaneta



How do we take Mathematics out of classrooms and into the real world of work, tradition, and everyday life? Making abstract mathematical concepts as real and concrete to mathematics learners has always been a challenge. This is certainly the case too for Indigenous students.

One possible answer is ethnomathematics, the study of the intersection of mathematics and culture, which is now finding its way int the Philippine government’s Indigenous Peoples’ Education (IPEd) program.

Brazilian mathematician Ubiratan D’Ambrosio conceptualized ethnomathematics as ethno [culture] + mathema [explaining, understanding] + tics [techné, arts, techniques]—“the art or technique of explaining, knowing, and understanding diverse cultural contexts.” Ethnomathematics as a field of study began in the latter part of the 1980s. A decade or so earlier, movements toward teaching basic education among culturally diverse peoples began to grow globally.

“It’s a worldwide movement born out of the realization that IPs have been marginalized for so many years, including within our educational systems,” explains Dr. Wilfredo V. Alangui, math professor at the UP Baguio College of Science. Through colonization, the IPs’ knowledge systems were supplanted by Western knowledge systems. This included Mathematics, which—despite being called “the universal language” and “the door and key of the sciences” that makes it seem removed from things like cultural bias—is a Western, mostly Eurocentric, strain.

In his paper, “There’s a Theory Behind What We’re Doing! Ethnomathematics and Indigenous Peoples’ Education in the Philippines,” which he presented at the 13th International Congress on Mathematical Education at the University of Hamburg in July 2016, Willy noted that in the Philippines, IPEd initiatives have been taken by the Department of Education (DepEd), civil society groups, IP organizations and other community-based efforts since the 1970s. Then in 2011, the DepEd issued Department Order 62, adopting the National Indigenous Peoples Education Policy Framework and creating the Indigenous Peoples Education Office (IPsEO) in 2012."

Twenty-three works of research and two keynote lectures were presented at the 17th Philippine-Spanish Friendship Day Conference on October 3 and 4, 2019, shedding light on law and order during Spanish times.

The annual conference held this year in the National Institute of Science and Mathematics Education Auditorium in UP Diliman had the theme, “The Pursuit of Colonial Oder: Interrogating Crime, Law, and Justice in Spanish Philippines”.

Supreme Court Associate Justice Marvic Mario Victor Leonen and Prof. Florentino Rodao of Universidad Complutense de Madrid were the keynote lecturers. They shared  their ideas on decolonizing law and social order.

 

Supreme Court Associate Justice Marvic Leonen appreciates the space given him to “step back to reflect upon the praxis that we as judges and justices engage in”, with a paper, “Reflections on the Postcolonial Constructions of Legal Text: An Invitation to a more Heterodoxical Interpretation as a Challenge to the Hegemony in the Academe”.

UP Los Baños celebrated the 100th anniversary of the day 193 students and 27 faculty members comprising the majority of the UP College of Agriculture enlisted with the Philippine National Guard to help the Allies fight World War I. The campus has named the day its Loyalty Day, celebrated since 1921.

It has become a most anticipated event for UPLB administration, faculty, staff, and students when they can reconnect with the alumni and reunite in the spirit of voluntarism and public service. This year, the Loyalty Day theme was “100 years of Uplifting Peoples’ Lives and Beyond”.

Performances of the UP Symphony Orchestra (UPSO), University choral groups, and several militant artists on a set-up dominated by an art installation brought the spirit of the First Quarter Storm (FQS) to life on February 7, 2020 on the historic AS Steps of UP Diliman’s Palma Hall.

The event, “FQS: Konsyertong Bayan sa Ika-50 Taon”, was written by Bonifacio Ilagan and directed by Chris Millado, with musical direction by UPSO Conductor Josefino Chino Toledo. It featured an art installation of Toym Imao, called “Nagbabadyang Unos”, inspired by the barricades of the UP Diliman Commune of 1971, and upon which flowers were offered for dead activists by University officials and National Artists from UP.

A crowd composed of FQS and Diliman Commune veterans, University constituents, and the general public converged for the evening concert, shielding themselves from the rain with jackets and umbrellas, but staying glued to their seats and places for the entirety of the show.

The numbers were linked together by spiels by Bonifacio Ilagan and atmospheric soundscape from the FQS recreated by Teresa Barrozo, beginning and ending with orchestral variations and community singing of “UP Naming Mahal”.

Primary Care benefits for all UP faculty and staff – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/sample-post-title-1/,"


New primary care benefits may now be availed of at the University Health Service (UHS) in UP Diliman. These health care benefits are given as part of a pilot study, “Philippine Studies in Primary Care”, which was launched on October 2016 to run for a year until September 30, 2017, unless otherwise extended. Jointly funded by UP System and Philhealth, the study aims to test the effectiveness of a primary care health delivery system in a corporate setting. “Our target beneficiaries are employees, which in the pilot study would refer to university staff of various categories.  Since they are part of the mandated clientele of the University Health Service, the health benefit package and the Primary Care health delivery system under study are in that sense, within a ‘corporate setting’,” according to UHS Acting Director Jesusa Catabui.

If found effective, the system may be adopted on a national scale and may be made the basis of an appropriate Outpatient Benefit Package by Philhealth, as well.

In an interview, UHS Acting Director Jesusa Catabui explained the significance of primary care and its important aspects.

Multi-awarded screenwriter, filmmaker, playwright, writer and editor, Bonifacio Parabuac Ilagan, added a new entry to his long list of accomplishments when he was awarded the 2019 Gawad Plaridel award on November 20, 2019.

After being presented the award, Ilagan also delivered the 2019 Plaridel lecture in a ceremony held at the UP Film Institute in Diliman. It was attended by University of the Philippines (UP) System, UP Diliman and UP College of Mass Communication (UP CMC) officials, students from the UP CMC and other UP units, fellow Gawad Plaridel awardees, and guests from media organizations and other universities.

As the citation for his award stated, Ilagan was presented the Gawad Plaridel “for his socially-conscious works in theater, film and television, which have garnered recognition from the Cultural Center of the Philippines Centennial Honors for the Arts, Gawad Balagtas, the UP Creative Writing Center, Don Carlos Palanca Memorial Awards for Literature, CCP Playwriting Contest, Palihang Aurelio V. Tolentino. Catholic Mass Media Awards, Film Academy of the Philippines, Star Awards, and the Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences.” He was also cited for his passionate commitment to the promotion of a progressive social agenda through his works on various media platforms, for his brave leadership of activist organizations, and for his dedication to advancing art and media that are liberated and liberative for the last 50 years.

The Gawad Plaridel is an annual award given by the UP System and the UP College of Mass Communication to outstanding media practitioners who have excelled in media (print, film, radio, television, and new media) and have performed with the highest level of professional integrity in the interest of public service. Mr. Ilagan was given the award in recognition of his lifetime achievement in the transmedia category, that is, as a Filipino media practitioner who has achieved excellence in at least two media platforms. He is the fifteenth recipient of the Gawad Plaridel and the second for the transmedia category, the first being Nora Cabaltera Villamayor, more popularly known as “Nora Aunor”, who was given the award in 2014.

In the footsteps of The Propagandist

A Martial Law survivor, lifelong activist and human rights advocate, Ilagan opened his Plaridel lecture by dedicating it to the memory of the Filipino heroes and martyrs who fought and died to defend democracy, freedom and human rights. “Ang Gawad Plaridel para sa akin ay isang hamon upang ipagpatuloy ang kanilang simulain,” he said.

He observed that propaganda can be a tool wielded by both those seeking to stifle freedom and those fighting to protect it. He noted that national hero Marcelo H. Del Pilar, who was editor of the reformist paper, La Solidaridad, from 1889 to 1895 and who helped crystallize nationalist sentiments and ignite libertarian ideas through his writings, had been given the label “The Propagandist”.

“Pero take note: ng kalayaan, hindi ng repression, ng liwanag, hindi ng dilim, ng demokrasya, hindi ng autokrasiya,” Ilagan added. The Gawad Plaridel is named after Del Pilar’s nom de plume, Plaridel.

Ilagan recounted his personal experience of the events of the so-called Second Propaganda Movement, the tumultuous period from the 1960s to the early 1970s that led to the First Quarter Storm, the Diliman Commune and the widespread activist movement against a fascist, increasingly authoritarian government.

“The portal that opened to me in the arts and the media was theater, and it happened during the life-changing tempest of my youth,” Ilagan recalled. He entered UP in 1968 as a political science student at the UP College of Arts and Sciences, and joined Wilfrido Ma. Guerrero’s UP Mobile Theater. He then later joined the Student Cultural Association of UP. After the First Quarter Storm, he became the chairperson of the Diliman Kabataang Makabayan, and organized a cultural group that eventually became Panday-Sining, one of at least four Manila-based street theater troupes that performed plays which hailed workers, peasants and the proletarian rebellion. He left UP Diliman to join the underground resistance movement in 1971, a year before President Ferdinand Marcos signed Proclamation 1081 declaring martial law.

Along with journalist Jose Ma. “Pete” Lacaba, a fellow Gawad Plaridel awardee for print, Ilagan was arrested in 1974, brought to Camp Crame and tortured. He was conditionally released from prison in 1976. He reenrolled in UP, and wrote his first play, the liturgical Pagsambang Bayan, which dramatized the wanton human rights violations of the Marcoses. Pagsambang Bayan was dedicated to the memory of his younger sister, Rizalina, an agriculture student in UP Los Baños, who was abducted in 1976 by a special military intelligence operative team along with nine other activists in Southern Tagalog.They later came to be known as the Southern Tagalog 10.

Ilagan continued to deepen his theater collaboration and to write subversive propaganda following Pagsambang Bayan. He also worked as a reporter for the TV Times magazine and as executive editor of The Review Philippines magazine. He worked for the RPN 9 TV network as script writer for public affairs shows, documentaries, soap operas and specials. He also had a chance to be a director. Two earlier works he did for television were the docu-drama series on Filipino freedom fighters called Alab ng Lahi, and Bisperas ng Kasaysayan, a 13-episode fictional story on the revolt of the masses. He also ventured into film with multi-awarded director Joel Lamangan, and co-wrote The Flor Contemplacion Story with screenwriter Ricardo Lee, another fellow Gawad Plaridel Awardee for film. His other screenplays include Dukot, which focuses on extrajudicial killings and political abductions, and Sigwa, about the First Quarter Storm and Martial Law, which won him the FAMAS award for Best Story and Best Screenplay in 2011.

“All through the years, I knew I had had to be a propagandist whose task was to seize opportunities when they came along in the pursuit of a commitment far beyond the personal,” Ilagan said. “The difficult task did not appear as daunting when one was bursting to communicate to people, to say what ought to be said precisely when it was prohibited to say so.”

He stressed that there is a need for propagandists like him to continue speaking up today. “Tyranny has resurrected, proclaiming authority over the land. History is being turned upside down, because the evils of the past have returned. To claim that the arts and media should be separated from and be free of politics is to perpetuate the oppressive and the exploitative cycle inflicted by an elite against the people. It is to discourage critical thinking at the very least and to abet the stifling of freedoms.”

He finished by declaring: “Never again to Martial Law!”

Creating a Nurturing and Healthy Diliman through PsycServ – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/creating-a-nurturing-and-healthy-diliman-through-psycserv/,"


For many freshmen, the privilege of being a UP student is an incomparable experience. Every year, thousands of hopefuls make a pilgrimage to their campuses of choice in the hope of eventually donning the iconic maroon-and-green. And for those who manage to get through, the promise of a new life is cause enough for optimism and celebration.

As with all great things, however, there is a another side to this charge. Just ask Dr. Violeta Bautista, head of UP Diliman’s (UPD) Clinical Psychology program. More than most, she has gotten to know first-hand the hidden fears and doubts that beset even the best UP applicants.

Years ago, while working as a consultant for the UP Health Service, Bautista and her colleagues noticed that a number of their interviewees hinted at looming psychological problems. When the institution revised its interview schedule and questionnaire to include items measuring the risk of students’ vulnerability to psychosocial issues, their fears were substantiated.

A good number of the applicants were evaluated as being at an elevated risk. For these individuals, getting medically cleared for enrollment required seeing a qualified mental health professional.

With the help of her interns, Bautista worked hard to meet this need, while also acting as the head of UP Diliman’s Office of Counseling and Guidance (OCG). It was during this stint that she was approached by UPD Chancellor Michael Tan with the mission to create an office completely devoted to giving psychosocial support and psychotherapy.

He asked, “Bolet, is it OK with you to help in establishing a new office?” The Chancellor himself had been hearing accounts of complicated mental health problems sometimes even manifesting as psychiatric conditions. “And of course that is beyond the realm of guidance and counseling,” Bautista said.

With that mandate, the UPD Psychosocial Services (PsycServ) was born, beginning small-scale operations in September 2017.

 

Firm foundations

While PsycServ is a project formed to address contemporary needs, the seeds of expertise that power it were put into place years ago. When Typhoons Ondoy and Yolanda struck the country in 2009 and 2013, members of the Department of Psychology trained field workers to provide psychological first aid, while counseling and giving therapy to the traumatized. They were also part of moves to establish a CSSP Wellness Center, which would allow the team members to exercise a more direct community service role.

Soon after, however, the team, which also include Dr. Anna Cristina Tuazon and Dr. Divine Love Salvador as clinical advisers, were receiving requests of a different sort. Students were being referred to them who had nowhere else to go. Many were suffering from anxiety and depression. Something needed to be done.

To address this, PsycServ currently offers an impressive roster of services to all members of the UP community. The most central of these is a free set of eight therapy sessions for clients with psychiatric conditions or so-called ‘complex problems of living’—cases that are not necessarily psychiatric in nature yet, but might require professional assistance. These problems might include anything from work and relationship stress to more serious, chronic conditions. PsycServ personnel are also trained in crisis management, which could be required in cases, for instance, of community members threatening to harm others or themselves.

Finally, in the unfortunate event of a suicide, PsycServ personnel also deliver postvention to support the bereaved. “There are those cases that never reach us,” Bautista said. “So we provide postvention services so they don’t suffer the consequences of knowing what happened.”

“Some feel guilty about not being able to do anything about what happened,” she said. “Or feeling that if that could happen to someone and he or she was so accomplished, what more me?” Even those who witnessed a failed suicide or who are bearing the stress of supporting a friend with problems might need professional help to process these events. All of these services are offered to members of the UP Diliman community, be they student, faculty or staff member.

UP to start accepting applications for first-year students on Jan. 7 – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/up-to-start-accepting-applications-for-first-year-students-on-jan-7/,"


The University of the Philippines will begin accepting applications for first-year students for Academic Year (AY) 2021-2022 on 7 January 2021, via an online portal especially for admissions applications.

First-year applicants to UP for AY 2021-2022 will not undergo the UP College Admissions Test (UPCAT). This decision follows the unanimous vote by the University Councils (UCs) of all the UP constituent universities not to administer the UPCAT for AY 2021-2022 in light of health and logistical issues brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. [Related: No UPCAT 2021, UP admissions system undergoing modification]

Instead of the UPCAT, the University Councils, the highest academic policymaking body of the constituent universities in the UP System, approved a modified freshmen admissions system specific to AY 2021-2022. This includes an additional assessment of incoming first-year students by academic units to qualify for a degree program, if deemed necessary. Applicants will be notified of such assessment or other additional requirements after the evaluation of their high school records.

The online submission of all application forms is likewise meant to minimize exposure to the novel coronavirus. The steps to applying as a first-year student to UP for AY 2021-2022 are as follows:"

As part of the academe’s role of conscientization, monitoring, and assessing the policies and performance of government, the Center for Policy and Executive Development (CPED) of the National College of Public Administration and Governance (NCPAG) of the University of the Philippines (UP) held a forum at the NCPAG Audio-Visual Room in the afternoon of September 3, 2019.

UP NCPAG faculty members, Dr. Ma. Victoria R. Raquiza, Dr. Enrico L. Basilio, and CPED Director Ebinezer R. Florano presented their reflections on the priority agenda stated by President Rodrigo R. Duterte in his fourth State of the Nation Address (SONA) last July, and discussed their assessments on the country’s social, economic and political dimensions, respectively.

Social Sector

Raquiza presented data showing the state of poverty, inequality, health, and education in the country, as she discussed the expected role of government in ensuring “that all members of society are able to attain a certain standard of living and have access to opportunities to improve their lives.” She emphasized that government should improve the people’s well-being, promote equality, and contribute to social cohesion.

Raquiza reported that Filipinos in the agriculture sector, farmers, fisherfolk, low-income earners, and those in urban poor communities benefit the least, even from the growth of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). “They languish in the low-value, low-productive, even precarious, labor market marked by poverty-level wages. They have little access to social protection, and they are exposed to hazardous working conditions,” she said. “Agriculture is in dire straits, . . . historically declining, and this decline continued under this administration,” she added.

Raquiza concluded that poverty incidence generally stayed the same, with the gains of observed economic growth not being equitably shared with the majority of the population.  She noted there is still high inequality, and that there has been no major breakthrough in the past 30 years. She recommended “more redistributive measures, especially in fiscal policy and measures.” She added that “access to quality education and quality healthcare remain a challenge for the majority,” and that these require “significant improvements”. “Given significant levels of poverty and inequality across various dimensions, there is need to increase focus on social equity,” she said.

Economic Sector

Basilio’s discussion focused on economic indicators and trends. He noted an above six percent GDP growth rate for the Philippines in the past 3 years, with construction, finance, real estate, manufacturing, trade, and services among the industries and sectors having the highest average growth rate from 2012 to the present.  However, he added that the country’s trade gap is widening, wherein there are more imports than exports, leading to a ballooning trade deficit and a declining import cover. He also reviewed the present drivers of economic growth, key legislations, and sources of revenues, such as the series of tax reform measures.

Making it in the marketplace – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/making-it-in-the-marketplace/,"Making it in the marketplace
May 3, 2018 | Written by Celeste Ann Castillo Llaneta



In that most technical of colleges in UP Diliman, the College of Engineering, is an advanced course with a different flavor.

The course is a fusion—part technology and innovation class, part crash course in marketing and business, and part personality and motivational workshop. However, unlike a traditional thesis course in Engineering that would result in a technology prototype, or a traditional entrepreneurship course in Business Administration that would produce a business plan, students here have to hurdle a real-life challenge in the world of industry: to successfully pitch a tech-business venture to a panel of Filipino and foreign industry leaders, technopreneurs, and potential capital investors. In short, students would have to prove that they and their venture have what it takes to make it in the marketplace.

The course was designed, improved and facilitated by a UP Electrical and Electronics Engineering professor and the director of the UP Technology Transfer and Business Development Office, Dr. Luis G. Sison based on his MS-level course IE 298. With the course title, “Higher Education Institutional Readiness for Innovation and Technopreneurship” (HIRIT), it aims to help students accelerate technology translation and startup formation by teaching the basic tools and skills for identifying and pursuing market opportunities, and by giving students the chance to network with technopreneurs, investors, and industry partners.

In December 2015, HIRIT won for Sison the UP Gawad Pangulo for Progressive Teaching and Learning. A year later, it won two silver medals for the Asia category and for the Teaching Delivery category in the third Reimagine Education Awards, a global competition for transformative initiatives across the educational sector.

R&D with economic impact

The course had its start in the Engineering Research and Development for Technology (ERDT), a consortium of eight universities that offers masters and doctoral degrees in various engineering fields.

“When the consortium was formed, there were concerns about the government making a lot of investments in R&D, and those investments not being translated into economic impact,” Sison recalls. “So they required all ERDT scholars to take a technopreneurship class.”

In 2009-2010, Visiting Professor Matthew Bristow handled the new course, which first-year ERDT scholars took during the summer term. The next year, Prof. Bristow was joined by Sison and fellow UP Engineering professor, Nestor Rañeses. The year after that, Sison and another UP faculty member took over the course.

 

Growth mindset and deliberate practice

The drive behind the evolution of the course can be seen in its introduction, which you can watch on the UP OVPAA YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HS68IRj3TM&t=261s). In it, Sison lays down the basic principles of the course, which feature some distinctly non-engineering concepts.

Dr. Sison lays down one of the ground rules in the technopreneurship introductory lecture video : “Everyone here in the class has to participate. There is no such thing as an observer in this class. You’re here, you join a team, you pitch a venture, you work on your venture.” Yes, even sit-in students who are not technically enrolled.

 

The first principle is that of the “growth mindset” as opposed to the “fixed mindset.” These terms were coined by Stanford University psychologist Carol Dweck to describe the underlying beliefs people have about learning and intelligence. With a fixed mindset, people believe their basic qualities, like their intelligence or talent, are fixed traits. They believe that talent alone, without effort, creates success. On the other hand, with a growth mindset, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment. According to Dweck, the most successful and motivated people are those who have a growth mindset.

The other principle is that of deliberate practice, referring to a special type of practice that is purposeful and systematic. In his video, Sison breaks down the components of deliberate practice into: 1) setting increasingly harder goals for yourself; 2) recognizing that it takes hard work; and, 3) learning from a coach or mentor and seeking and responding to continuous feedback.

Product-market fit

Students’ performance in the technopreneurship class is measured by how well they perform on the last and most critical day: demo day. That is, how well their pitches are received by the panelists, and how well they are able to respond to the panelists’ questions. The panelists then rate the ventures with a “yes”, “no” or “maybe”, and the teams are awarded points based on that.

The end-goal is for students to get market validation, or what is called product-market fit, for their venture. “Does your product address a solution that the end-users, the customers, are willing to pay for? That is the goal, and students are allowed to iterate both the technology, the business model, and even the target market until they’ve achieved that goal,” explains Sison."

Prof. Virginia “Betty” Flor-Agbayani at the UP Alumni Association in America 2011 Homecoming

 

One chapter in UP Diliman: Home and Campus (UP Press, 2010) describes how Professor Emeritus Virginia “Betty” Flor-Agbayani, then an instructor at the UP School of Fine Arts, looked upon the site of the new UP Diliman campus, which in 1949 was a vast frontier land overgrown with cogon grass, with only two concrete buildings and the Sierra Madre mountains as backdrop, and declared it beautiful, “like a cathedral without walls”.

Prof. Flor-Agbayani was one of the UP pioneers who made the exodus from the 10-hectare campus on Padre Faura St. to the new UP campus in Diliman. Following a fire that razed one of the houses in Area 2—houses on campus were made of sawali at the time—UP President Bienvenido Gonzalez asked Prof. Agbayani how UP could help the residents. She replied, “Sir, permanent housing.”

The UP budget, however, had no provision for faculty or staff housing at the time. Later, “sensing that Agbayani was really a pioneer at heart” according to the book, UP President Vidal Tan approached Agbayani and her husband, Mariano Leano, and asked whether she was willing to “volunteer” to build her own home, using their own money. They agreed, and the Agbayanis built their first home, the first permanent house in the Diliman campus in the site known as Area 1.

 

Artist, educator, pioneer

“Pioneering” is a word that was associated with Prof. Flor-Agbayani throughout her life and career until her passing on October 22, 2018 in Sherman Oaks, California, at the age of 96. Born on May 20, 1922 and hailing from Batac, Ilocos Norte, Prof. Flor-Agbayani graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from the UP School of Fine Arts in 1947. During her college years, she became Junior Council and Student Council representative, was president of Pallete and the Brush Association, chairperson of the Fine Art’s Woman’s Club, and a member of Phi Alpha. She was a staff artist of the Philippine Collegian from 1946-1947, and an associate editor and a staff artist of the 1947 Philippinensian. 

After graduating in 1947, Prof. Flor-Agbayani worked as an instructor at the UP School of Fine Arts, and was instrumental in the transition of the School of Fine Arts to the College of Fine Arts in 1970. In 1975, she became the country’s first woman to be given the Fine Arts full professor rank.

Some of the questions she answered during the discussion were the following:

Q. How often should people, particularly women, have a heart check-up with a doctor?

Cabral: It varies. For people like us, early detection is important; so we should get regular check-ups with our doctors. Even if you are feeling well, you should go for a checkup with your doctor, maybe every six months. If you do not feel well, that is certainly time for you to see your doctor.

Q. For women who are undergoing menopause, doctors sometimes prescribe estrogen pills. Are these safe?

UP announces additional flexible academic measures for the remainder of the semester – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/up-announces-additional-flexible-academic-measures-for-the-remainder-of-the-semester/,"


 

Recognizing the extreme challenges of switching to remote teaching and learning in the middle of a pandemic, and economic and technological limitations made worse by the spate of typhoons that battered the country, the University of the Philippines has announced additional flexible academic measures for the remainder of the first semester of AY 2020-2021. This includes the extension of the deadline for the submission of grades to give students more time to accomplish academic requirements and faculty to grade them, and a policy of no failing grades to be given to students this semester. 

After due deliberation on the situation of faculty and students in the wake of the typhoons, and in the spirit of balancing divergent positions and interests of faculty and students in the wider context of Philippine higher education, the UP Administration—specifically President’s Advisory Council (PAC), composed of the UP System Executive Committee, Chancellors, and the Philippine General Hospital and UP Bonifacio Global City Directors—upon the recommendation of the Academic Affairs Committee consisting of the Vice-President for Academic Affairs, Assistant Vice-Presidents for Academic Affairs and Vice-Chancellors for Academic Affairs of UP’s constituent units—endorsed the guidelines for the remainder of the first semester AY 2020-2021 and the proposed modification of the academic calendar for the second semester AY 2020-2021 and midyear 2021. The academic guidelines were laid down in Memorandum No. 2020-143 issued by the UP System Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs (OVPAA) on 26 November 2020.

The UP Board of Regents, in its 1356th meeting on the same day, approved the PAC-endorsed guidelines and modified academic calendar with an additional condition for the conduct of bridging activities.

 

Guidelines for the remainder of the semester

The first semester for AY 2020-2021 will end as scheduled, with 9 December as the last day of classes, and final examinations to be held from 11 to 18 December. However, the deadline for the submission of grades is moved from 8 January to 22 January 2021 to give students more time to complete requirements and the faculty more time to grade them. 

Moreover, the grades for the first semester AY 2020-2021 will be numeric. The reason for the numeric grades is that, unlike in the second semester of the previous academic year when the University was caught unprepared by the pandemic and the subsequent lockdowns, students have been provided course packs to enable independent learning even when formal classes are not possible. Many students also need grades for scholarships, licensure examinations, future studies, and employment requirements. 

However, a grade of 4.0 or conditional failure, or a failing grade of 5.0 shall not be given this semester. Faculty members are also not allowed to give a forced drop (DRP) to students on the basis of non-attendance of synchronous classes or non-communication within the semester, for instance, during scheduled consultations. Instead, students will be given an INC. 

This change effectively suspends the rule on attendance that states: “When the number of hours lost by student’s absence reaches 20 percent of the hours of recitation, lecture, laboratory, or any other scheduled work in one subject, s/he shall be dropped from the subject; . . . If the majority of the absences is excused, a student shall not be given a grade of 5.00 upon being thus dropped (often referred to as ‘forced drop’); but if the majority of the absences are not excused, the student shall be given a grade of 5.00 upon being thus dropped.”

Faculty members are encouraged to help students affected by the typhoons and the pandemic to comply with the requirements in time for the 22 January deadline for the submission of grades. Students with missing or incomplete requirements by 22 January shall be given a grade of INC. Suspended is the rule that states that a student whose class standing is not “passing” and who fails to complete requirements or take the final exam automatically receives a grade of 5.0. Instead, students will be allowed to complete their requirements within the prescribed period within one academic year, after which they shall be given a final grade. Students who fail to complete an INC within the prescribed period must re-enroll in the course or its equivalent. 

Faculty members are enjoined to continue calibrating their course requirements with the current conditions in mind. Course requirements may be further reduced to the essentials of a course, and no additional course requirements should be specified. Faculty members may conduct bridging academic activities before the extended deadline for the submission of grades, provided the students in their course agree to these. 

 

Suspended academic rules and modified academic calendar

The UP Administration also issued a reminder in the memo that, in addition to the suspended rules on class attendance and INCs above, the following academic rules remain suspended with the approval of the BOR:

1. The deadline for dropping and filing of leave of absence is suspended.
2. A 12-unit course load will be considered a regular load for undergraduate students.
3. The First Semester AY 2020-2021 will not be counted towards MRR. This is because it is the first time for students to do remote learning and they will still calibrate the course load that they can manage, especially for graduate students who are working from home and for other students who have a workload outside of their school work.
4. A student enrolled in a course this semester that is a prerequisite to another shall be allowed to enroll in the latter course for credit in the subsequent semester, despite having no grade yet for the prerequisite course given the extension of the deadline for submission of grades to 22 January 2021.
5. The following rules on scholastic delinquency are suspended for the first semester AY 2020-2021:

Molecular epidemiologist explains vaccine effect for the Philippines – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/molecular-epidemiologist-explains-vaccine-effect-for-the-philippines/,"


Molecular epidemiologist Dr. Edsel Maurice Salvana was positive on the safety and benefit of the vaccines with emergency use authorizations (EUAs) in the Philippines’ fight against COVID-19, and on the manageability of COVID-19 cases in the country as the vaccines were being rolled out.

Speaking on February 23, 2021 as the resource person for the online forum, eKapihan, organized by the UP Alumni Association, Salvana warned, however, that the figures on both COVID-19 cases and those from clinical trials of the vaccines, on which he based his talk, were subject to change, as both were on-going events.

Vaccine effect

Salvana also said that based on clinical trials thus far, none of the vaccines available for emergency use can totally prevent viral transmission; but although they may not be able to “kill the lion”, they can “turn it into a kitten”, that is, prevent hospitalization from severe cases, thus easing the burden on the health care system, and prevent death.

Salvana compared Pfizer, Astra, and Sinovac, the three vaccines with EUAs in the country, and Moderna with each other. He noted that Sinovac, based on its Brazil “stress-test” on health workers, understandably lagged in terms of protecting recipients from developing symptoms; but it was still at par with Astra and Moderna in preventing by 100 percent deaths or cases that would necessitate hospitalization.

“What is urgently needed? The vaccines to prevent deaths and severe disease among the vulnerable is the most important right now, until we can get to the point when we can block transmission and get herd immunity,” Salvana said. He referred to the frontliners, the elderly, and the chronically ill as the vulnerable populations.

“The data for children are not given for now. That doesn’t mean it’s not going to work [on them], but there are still clinical trials ongoing that can better define how we can use these vaccines,” Salvana pointed out. “Do not give for now,” he said, referring to children.

Salvana stressed that vaccine development for COVID-19 started 17 years ago from the original SARS outbreak.

He added that 208 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine had been given, “and not a single person [had] been proven to have died from it.” But caution must be taken on pregnant, immunocompromised, those with severe allergies, and the “frail elderly”. They should consult their doctors first.

Pandemic manageability

Salvana expressed optimism regarding the pandemic outlook in the Philippines. “If we stick to minimum health standards, our cases number will actually remain manageable.”

To illustrate, he said there should have been a major surge at the end of January and the first couple of weeks of February following the last holidays, when a lot of people came out.

“Thankfully [the surge] didn’t happen which tells me people are starting to learn to live with the virus,” Salvana said. “All we really did see was a little bump up and it was outside Metro Manila.”

“Looking at what’s going on right now, the curve remains relatively flat, which makes me hopeful that we’re gonna be able to keep this trend until we get everyone vaccinated,” he concluded.

“The case fatality rate is better than worldwide—2 percent versus 3 percent. Our deaths are relatively low. We’re the 110th in the world in terms of deaths per million—109 per million compared to the US which has 15 times our death rate per million or 1,446 [per million], 1,294 [per million] in France,” Salvana said.

According to him, “The positivity rate [from tests] has been going down. It’s consistently about 5-6 percent.” Case management is also improving leading to higher survival rates, he said.

“Our number of cases is actually pretty good compared to other countries,” Salvana pointed out.

Because of these, he said the economy can remain open as the vaccines are being rolled out. If there are localized surges, he recommended proactive contact tracing and localized lockdowns."

Celia Diaz Laurel draws final curtain at 93 – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/celia-diaz-laurel-draws-final-curtain-at-93/,"


“All the world’s a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances,
And one man in his time plays many parts,”

— William Shakespeare, As You Like It

A celebrated thespian indeed, Celia Diaz Laurel, played many parts on stage, acting in 74 plays from 1947 to 1992. But she was also more than an actress. She was a production, set, and costume designer, with 83 productions in her belt.

Outside the world of theater, but still in the realm of the arts, she had multiple roles as well: painter, author, philanthropist, and advocate. It was the same in her personal life. She was “mommy”, “lola”, “tita”, “Nenita” and “Nitay” to her family, relatives and friends.

To many, she was the Celia Diaz Laurel. And she bade farewell to her many roles on 12 July 2021 when she succumbed to complications from a stroke. She was 93.

Born on 29 May 1928 in Talisay, Negros Occidental to Anselmo Sison Diaz and Concepcion Gonzalez Franco, Maria Luz Celia Teresita was the youngest of six children. Her family moved to Manila when she was five. She studied at the Assumption Convent, where she was first exposed to stage performance. But it was in UP, where she would further harness her talent.

In 1947, she entered the Fine Arts (FA) program of the University, where she learned from future National Artists Maestros Fernando Amorsolo and Guillermo Tolentino. In the same year, she became a member of the UP Dramatic Club. It was then under the helm of its newly appointed director, Wilfrido Ma. Guerrero, who was himself also later named National Artist.

Throughout her college life, Celia was able to successfully balance her roles as: FA student; theater actress in the UP Dramatic Club, Manila Community Players, and Dramatic Philippines; and, UP Swimming Team member. She was even able to nurture a blossoming relationship with a law student named Salvador Roman “Doy” Hidalgo Laurel, whom she married in 1950, and who would later become a senator and then a vice president of the Philippines. Doy and Celia, already parents of two, graduated from UP in 1952.

Surviving the ‘Big One’ with Diwata-2’s Amateur Radio Unit – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/surviving-the-big-one-with-diwata-2s-amateur-radio-unit/,"Surviving the ‘Big One’ with Diwata-2’s Amateur Radio Unit
May 14, 2019 | Written by Andre DP Encarnacion



 

Last month, the Philippines experienced two strong earthquakes in Luzon and Leyte —each measuring at least 6.0 in magnitude—reviving anxieties about the “Big One,’’ an extremely powerful quake that experts predict could hit with devastating effect during our lifetime.

A catastrophic event of such magnitude struck Haiti in 2010, when a magnitude 7.0 earthquake with an epicenter near the capital of Port-au-Prince quickly took the lives of hundreds of thousands. Compounding rescue efforts, the quake also devastated the country’s communication infrastructure.

In that desperate time, an unexpected group of people heroically acted as bridges between emergency responders and survivors. Amateur radio operators or ‘hams’ tuned into the appropriate frequencies and, with the help of satellites, acted as the eyes and ears of the rescue teams. Once a mere backup system, the amateur radio band became a lifeline, handling most emergency communications in the immediate aftermath of the quake.

It is easy to imagine how communication in the Philippines, despite a population of 60 million social media users, could be similarly crippled should the ‘Big One’ strike. Luckily, not only does the country have a close-knit community of amateur radio enthusiasts ready to assist, but we also now have a satellite that can facilitate their communication to any place in the archipelago.

The innovation responsible for this is Diwata-2’s Amateur Radio Unit (ARU), which was formally unveiled on April 26. Described by its makers as something of a “walkie-talkie in space,” the ARU allows radio operators to communicate with anyone anywhere in the country.

Recently, the UP MPRO had a conversation with three STAMINA4Space engineers behind Diwata-2’s ARU. Izrael Zenar Bautista, Lorenzo Sabug, Jr., and Mary Ann Zabanal-Constante had worked persistently to fit what could become the country’s last line of communication into the microsatellite’s 56-kilogram frame.

Bautista, currently a PhD student at the Kyushu Institute of Technology (Kyutech), said the ARU is primarily responsible for Diwata-2’s functionality as a communications satellite. More than any other item in its payload, it is the ARU that allows people to converse over vast distances.

The unit was born out of a need to improve an already great thing. After Diwata-1 was launched in 2016, the team was already thinking of ways to make its successor better. The engineers were specifically looking to bring the technology closer to ordinary citizens. Bautista said he believes that the ARU democratizes the use of Diwata-2, because even regular citizens with inexpensive equipment can use it.

“That’s because the frequency is free for all to use,” he said. “Theoretically, anyone can use it.” This is especially true for amateur radio enthusiasts, many of whom prefer to “homebrew” or self-construct rather than buy their equipment.

“You just need to have the right equipment in order to participate,” Bautista added.

The two primary functions of Diwata-2’s ARU are to be an FM voice repeater (FMVR) and an Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS) message repeater. The voice repeater, allows people to wirelessly converse through voice, with the satellite facilitating the communication.

“Actually, with the altitude of Diwata-2,” Bautista added, “you can talk to someone from anywhere in the Philippines. You don’t need to spend for load or the internet; you just need a radio and an antenna.”

The APRS message repeater, on the other hand, acts more like a text message. It allows you to receive messages sent by fellow amateur radio enthusiasts via the ARU. Not only can you now send messages to first responders in the event of a major disaster; you can also transmit temperature, weather information and GPS data to others.

Step-by-step

Diwata-2’s ARU makes use of two radio signals familiar to amateur radio operators worldwide—ultra-high frequency (UHF, 437.500 MHz); and, very-high frequency (VHF, 145.900 MHz). According to Lorenzo Sabug Jr., this familiarity is a benefit.

“This means that hams who have accessed other amateur radio satellites only have to do what they’re used to in order to access Diwata-2. And there are so many affordable handheld transmitters that we can tune to UHF and VHF frequencies that make communicating with satellites much more cost-effective.”

Sabug noted that there are three steps that an amateur radio operator should follow in order to connect to Diwata-2’s ARU. The first is tracking the satellite as it passes overhead.

“We have available orbit tracker apps for mobile phones or PCs. We can track when Diwata-2 is passing over and its direction in the sky,” he said. One should then tune their equipment to 145.900 MHz to receive transmissions from Diwata-2 or 437.500 MHz to transmit messages to others.

ULyS3ES-1 and ULyS3ES-2

The ULyS3ES consists of two buildings in the UPD-EEEI complex, dubbed Building 1 and Building 2. ULyS3ES is “an interdisciplinary facility that serves as a pioneering academic hub for research and development (R&D) and instruction innovations in space technology in the Philippines.” Through this new two-building laboratory, engineers and researchers will “collaborate on the development of small satellites through relevant mission planning and the corresponding design, implementation and test of satellite bus and payload systems.”

Building 1 of ULyS3ES (ULyS3ES-1) features office and research spaces that are designed to foster close interactions and open collaboration among the disciplines that contribute to space science and technology, including electrical and electronics engineering, mechanical engineering, physics, environmental science, and space studies. Building 1 also includes administrative and faculty spaces, shared spaces for researchers, a conference and meeting area, and an exhibit area in the lobby. The research laboratory in ULyS3ES-1 includes equipment for functional testing of small satellite components and integrated systems, “clean booths” for small satellite assembly, a thermal-vacuum chamber for space environment testing of nanosatellites as well as rapid prototyping equipment. It also houses the Engineering Model of the 50kh microsatellite, Diwata-2, and a Flight Model (FM) of the 1 kg nanosatellite, Maya-1. These satellite models are functional replicas of the actual satellites that were deployed in space, and are used as test beds for further experimentation, research and instruction.

Building 2 or ULyS3ES-2, located behind Building 1, includes a conference room, classroom and reconfigurable work space, including a “clean booth” for nanosatellite assembly. It also hosts testing facilities for small satellite components and systems, including a Full Anechoic Chamber (FAC), as well as a temperature and humidity test chamber. The FAC, located in its lobby, is a facility for measuring antenna radiation patterns over a frequency range of 600 MHz to 26.5 GHz (extendable to 40 GHz). The radiation patterns show the directional distribution of energy radiated by the antenna; they can therefore give an idea of the antenna performance in providing wireless range and coverage. The temperature and humidity test chamber, on the other hand, is used to mimic conditions that products might reasonably experience in their eventual working environment.

From “University Laboratory” to ULyS3ES

Present at the inauguration ceremony were officials from: the Department of Science and Technology (DOST); the DOST Advanced Science and Technology Institute (DOST-ASTI); the Philippine Council for Industry, Energy and Emerging Technology Research and Development (PCIEERD); the DOST Science Education Institute (DOST-SEI); the Sustained Support for Local Space Technology and Applications Mastery, Innovation and Advancement (STAMINA4Space) Program, which is the Philippine government’s space technology program succeeding the Philippine Scientific Earth Observation Microsatellite (PHL-Microsat) program; and, the Space Science and Technology Proliferation through University Partnerships (STEP-UP) Project. Also present were: officials from UP Diliman, the UP College of Engineering and the College of Science, and the UP EEEI; officials and representatives from private industry partners, the Aerospace Industry Association of the Philippines and the Philippine Navy; members of the University Space Engineering Consortium of the Philippines (UNISEC-Philippines); and, representatives from academe and the media attended.

In his welcome message, Dr. Joel Joseph Marciano, Jr., the acting director of DOST-ASTI, program leader of STAMINA4Space and a professor at the UP EEEI, explained the inspiration behind the acronym ULyS3ES, which was not, he said, Ulysses, or in the original Greek (Odysseus), the mythological warrior whose exploits are told in Homer’s the Iliad and the Odyssey. Instead, the acronym came from the name “University Laboratory for Small Satellites and Space Engineering Systems” itself.

“The name came about by a rather strong notion in our heads about what we set out to do. We were really just trying to build a university laboratory,” Dr. Marciano said. “As a university laboratory, it embodies and hopes to fulfill the vital role of the academia in advancing and pushing the boundaries of knowledge in space technology and cascading its benefits to society.” After picking the letters “U”, “L” and “Y” from the words “University Laboratory”, he added that “the rest of the letters were not hard to flesh out.”"

For the University of the Philippines (UP), mental health (MH) and psychosocial wellbeing is a top priority, now more so than ever. Since last year, Since last year, UP students and faculty have had to adjust to the abrupt shift to remote and online teaching and learning. At the same time, they have to confront the stress and anxiety of coping with a global health crisis, the pain of loss, and financial and economic worries, on top of the usual pressures of academic life in UP and other family and personal issues. Many UP students find themselves struggling alone, and sometimes the burden can be too much.

Fully aware of the critical need for mental health awareness and promotion, the UP System Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs (OVPAA) and Office of Student Financial Assistance (OSFA) initiated several mental health promotion programs in 2021. One such program is the “Sandigan, Sandalan Training and Advocacy Programs for Mental Health.” A component project under the “Sandigan, Sandalan” initiative is the Search for UP Student Mental Health Advocacy Projects, a UP System-wide search for innovative mental health promotion ideas from eligible student organizations and groups.

The project allows for the involvement of UP students in mental health promotion by featuring student-led programs that other groups can replicate. As of October, 10 entries for these programs have been submitted to the OSFA:

The October 2020 Mental Health Celebration by the UP Behavioral Science Society is a month-long project focusing on mental health awareness and promotion. As part of its year-long promotion of behavioral science concepts and their relevance and ubiquity in society, the organization launched a four-part information campaign series on mental health for MH month. It discussed body image issues and how Filipino values affect mental health, ultimately providing a more holistic view of mental health through the integration of psychology, sociology, and anthropology. The release included films that did not feed into the common misconceptions and social stigmas related to mental health. The series was launched with a Facebook post, “Debunking Mental Health Myths,” which aimed to present a more accurate picture of mental health and issues. The post reached 9,700 Facebook users, and 1,000 users liked, commented on, and shared the post.

 

UPLB DALUYONG: Bridging the Gaps of Isolation in these Trying Times

The objectives of the Samahan ng mga Mag-aaral ng Teknolohiyang Panlipunan-UP Los Baños (UPLB) has always included the promotion of camaraderie and the holistic development of its residents. However, with the ongoing pandemic, the organization has had to adjust its activities to maintain and strengthen the members’ relationships despite the geographical distance present at these times. Thankfully, online platforms have helped connect and create an environment that is easily accessible for the organization members. To replicate the feeling of physical classes, the organization has created a Discord server that mimics the org tambayan, the lobby of UPLB College of Human Ecology (CHE). The members of the organization have focused on being present in each other’s lives by incorporating games and activities that promote camaraderie and cooperation among the members through web-based platforms. Through these activities, the residents are provided with opportunities to bond and communicate. With the current setup faced by students, several adjustments have been made to ensure that the members feel secure and comfortable in the organization they belong to. Despite the lack of physical interaction, STP-UPLB has created a safe space for the members of its organization.

 

AKAP: Psychological First Aid Workshop

The UP Medical Students for Social Responsibility (UPMSSR) and the Asian Medical Students’ Association – Philippines (AMSA-Phil) are continuing and expanding the annual psychological first-aid (PFA) workshop, dubbed “AKAP: Psychological First Aid Workshop,” to transition into training trainers with PFA knowledge and skills, with a vision to eventually train enough participants to be able to establish a mental health helpline operated by AMSA-Phil members. Currently, AMSA-Phil is meeting with other stakeholders such as the Alliance of Philippine Medical Colleges to host an event tackling Disaster Medicine and MH. The two-day event hosted discussions on mental health, PFA, its role in MH care, and its applications last June 24 and 26. The event aimed to equip medical students with PFA skills to build resilience, support, and hope during the pandemic. The UPMSSR will also host a capacity-building workshop on improving safe spaces and organizational culture alongside this.

The relaunch of the initiative was done through social media platforms and with the help of partner organizations, namely, Positive Youth Development Network (PYDN) through the Young House Heroes Initiative (YHHI) Hingyap PH. “Halcyon Headlines” will primarily benefit people who are on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. One specific mental health topic or issue each month serves as the sole focus of the online publication. “Halcyon Headlines” will explain the common symptoms of academic burnout among students and feature personal testimonies on such experiences. “Halcyon Headlines” will also incorporate suggestions on how to help others deal with these issues and provide tips on how to counter psychological distress during and upon patient recovery.

 

Isip Mo Sagip Ko; Bookmark This: You Matter–Bookmark Donation Drive

The idea behind “Isip Mo, Sagip Ko” was pioneered by several members of Partido sang Mainuswagon nga Bumultho (PMB) of UP Visayas. The first phase of “Isip Mo, Sagip Ko” was organized in September 2018. “Isip Mo Sagip Ko” aims to eradicate the stigma and stereotyping of mental health in provinces; provide psychosocial support and an entertainment platform while promoting mental health awareness through games and interactive activities; and organize a series of webinars featuring mental health experts. It also encourages participants to share their experiences. The project continued until January 2019 for the second phase of its implementation.

In line with the PMB’s celebration of its 39th anniversary, a face-to-face version of “Bookmark This: You Matter Bookmark Donation Drive” was launched in partnership with the local government of Due and the Due Municipal Health Office. Resident PMB members showcased their creativity by designing bookmarks following the theme #MentalHealthMatters. These bookmarks were then published online for public consumption. “Bookmark This: You Matter” aims to inform communities about the importance of mental health in our daily lives, especially in a learning setup that can make us feel disconnected from one another. At the same time, it raises the call for accessible and functional mental health facilities for immediate communities.

UP Open University (UPOU) Networks is the first of its kind in the country, perhaps even in Southeast Asia. It’s certainly the first among member institutions in the Asian Association of Open Universities.

UPOU Networks is an online repository of multimedia learning materials, both open and proprietary, produced by the University. And in this day and age, when the Internet releases tons of data faster than you can say “information superhighway,” wouldn’t you like to learn from a reliable source?

 

Examples of UP-produced open educational resources found inside the UPOU Commons, which is only one of four sections inside UPOU Networks

 

Creating content, sharing knowledge

Describing the uniqueness of UPOU Networks, UPOU Chancellor Melinda Bandalaria says that “This is not just an index or listing of links to learning materials, which is quite common. This is a collection of UP-created content which we are disseminating online and sharing with everyone.”

For UPOU Information Office Director Joane Serrano, who was also director of the UPOU Multimedia Center until recently, the initiative allows the University to further contribute to the collective knowledge and content coming from the Global South. “We’re mostly consumers of learning objects from the Global North, especially open educational resources (OERs). This needs to be challenged. We need to work toward a level playing field,” Serrano says. The Center is involved in the production of most materials in UPOU Networks.

So what does one get from UPOU Networks?

Accessing networks.upou.edu.ph brings you a variety of content. UPOU Live is where lectures, symposia, research presentations, seminars, and other University events are broadcast in real time. UPOU On Record is a collection of podcasts and other audio materials. UPOU Commons is where OERs are housed under a Creative Commons license. UPOU Mix contains learning objects in various formats and on different topics.

 

Pushing for genuine openness

The UN Sustainable Development Goal 4 is “to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.” The UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has identified OERs as strategic in improving access to quality education.

UPOU, whose leadership in open and distance e-learning has been recognized by law through the Open and Distance Learning Act, fully supports these global initiatives by pioneering the OER movement in the country. “Not many people in the Philippines know about OERs, which is why the University needs to work even harder for this revolutionary education movement to take root and prosper,” Serrano continues.

All UP constituents, students, faculty, administrators, and staff, are dealing with the “uncertain” and “unusual” situation forced by the COVID-19 pandemic on teaching, learning, and operations.

This was acknowledged by the officials of the University of the Philippines in its online welcome ceremony for students on September 9, the day before the first semester of Academic Year 2020-2021 officially started. UP President Danilo Concepcion, Vice President for Academic Affairs Maria Cynthia Rose Bautista, and Student Regent John Isaac Punzalan all said the event was certainly not the welcome new and returning students expected.

Concepcion called this semester a “testament to our ability as Filipinos to overcome hardships”. He asked the UP community for understanding and cooperation as everyone grapples with new methods and processes. There will be mistakes and inadequacies, and some necessities may not be given or addressed immediately, but Concepcion emphasized that “as long as we are united in our belief that the pandemic must not succeed in crippling education and intellectual development, the torch of knowledge will triumph over our fears and worries.”

To freshmen, in particular, he asked them to accept the new normal as a historic challenge, one that would be the mark of their generation as students who continued to study and learn despite a pandemic. In the end, Concepcion reiterated the importance of keeping health and safety as top priorities and that while the University’s buildings may be closed, UP as an institution remains open to its constituents.

Bautista, meanwhile, said COVID-19 “thrust universities worldwide into uncharted territory.” Remote learning would be the norm for UP at this time, she added, clarifying that remote learning does not exclusively mean online learning. It means holding no physical meetings, possibly employing ICT, and being synchronous/real-time or asynchronous.

Course packs in digital or printed format will be the “primary means of delivering course content”. She described course packs for remote learning as more comprehensive than course packs for face-to-face classes, because these include study guides. Some faculty members will be providing course packs at the beginning of the semester while some will be giving these at intervals.

 

Slides from UP VP for Academic Affairs Bautista’s presentation during the UP Systemwide Opening of AY 2020-2021 Online Welcome Ceremony. The replay can be viewed on TVUP’s YouTube channel.

 

“This semester will definitely be far from ideal,” Bautista admitted. “If we were still unable to predict problems that arose even under the best circumstances of a regular semester, we will definitely be unable to anticipate many more unprecedented problems as we shift to remote learning, but we will learn from these problems, find solutions to them iteratively, and build on these solutions for a better planned second semester.”

She further revealed that UP recognized the imperfections of this semester and “continues to suspend rules on academic standing.” This semester will not be counted as part of the maximum residence rule for students and their regular load of 15 units has been reduced to 12 units.

Assistant Vice President for Student Affairs Richard Philip Gonzalo, who is also the director of the Office of Student Financial Assistance, gave a brief orientation on the reconfiguration of the UP Student Affairs System (SAS) as well as its new programs in response to remote learning.

Factors considered in the reconfiguration include: independent learning with limited interaction with peers and personnel; the home as a new learning environment which may not be fully conducive; digital divide; socioeconomic circumstances of households; effects of remote learning on mental health and psychosocial well-being; venues for connecting and expressing freedoms; and, protection of students’ rights.

The new SAS programs to be rolled out are: the Student Learning Assistance System (SLAS); the UP Student Mental Health and Wellness Network; Peer Learning Groups (PLGs); and, the Student Helpdesk.

The SLAS expands Student Financial Assistance Online, which was created in 2014 to accept applications for tuition subsidy and allowance. It will gather information on financial capacity, connectivity situation and options, and other learning assistance requirements to allow students to continue their studies.

Call for applications: International Workshop in ‘Omics in Infectious Diseases – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/call-for-applications-international-workshop-in-omics-in-infectious-diseases/,"


 

UP’s Philippine Genome Center in partnership with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) through the funding support of DOST’s Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (PCHRD), and British Council’s Newton Fund Program is once again organizing an international workshop on infectious diseases this time with focus in ‘Omics technology.

The applications of ‘Omics technologies in health is huge, and improving local capability in this area is the rationale behind this international workshop. While it is important to build on the Philippines’ capability in this area, the workshop in its entirety is meant to increase the level of awareness and correct misconceptions regarding the relevant technology requirements in order to pursue “omics” research in the Philippines.

The workshop happening on November 5-9 in UP Diliman will consist two symposia on ID ‘omics and control, flanking a hands-on analytical/computational short course in ‘omics data generation and analysis.

The five-day workshop aims to:
(i) inform policy makers, public health workers, clinicians and biomedical researchers on the potential of ‘omics technology in performing ID surveillance and control, assisting in the rapid detection of drug resistance strains, and informing clinical disease management, including next generation diagnostics
(ii) equip researchers and field epidemiologists with the analytical tools to perform genomic surveillance and analyses locally, and to harness the Philippine-wide networks that the PGC, University of the Philippines (UP) and LSHTM can support to perform regional ID surveillance
(iii) develop an effective regional network for ID genomic surveillance in Philippines, centered on the genomic capacity of the PGC and by harnessing the expertise available in LSHTM
(iv) build capacity in the basic tools of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and other ‘omics analysis that can be applied to multiple areas of research across a wide range of organisms, including the evaluation of host-pathogen interactions and specific host or pathogen responses
(v) provide hands-on experience with the generation and analysis of ‘omics data, including the application of portable sequencing and processing of the resulting big data. Advanced users are allowed to develop more advanced analysis pipelines."

“Lunas na Sakto para sa Puso ng Pilipino: Personalized Medicine in Cardiovascular Health Care” was the presentation of Dr. Rody Sy, a project leader in the Cardiovascular Genetics Program. The aim of personalized medicine is “the right drug, at the right dose, for the right Filipino.” He said that while studies on genetic markers associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and response to drugs across varying populations have shown “inter-ethnic variability,” there is “insufficient pharmacogenetic and genetic susceptibility data among Filipinos.” Sy added that by studying genetic markers, treatments costs may decrease, and ineffective chronic therapy may be diminished because of guided treatment.

Molecular Diabetes Study Group Project Leader Dr. Jose Nevado’s “Sweet Genes Are Made of This: Let’s talk about diabetes!” was presented under the Diabetes Genetics Program. Similar to Sy in his talk on CVD, Nevado also lamented the lack of genetic studies on Filipinos for risk of diabetes. The group has narrowed down “six significant gene variations of interest after statistical tests” from the initial 355 gene variations linked to the disease, which was trimmed to 274 variations after quality assurance tests, and later further cut down to 29 variations after genetic tests.

The University of the Philippines (UP) is one step closer to providing ordinary Filipinos greater access to its brand of world-class and affordable tertiary hospital care and comprehensive cancer care through two upcoming projects: the UP Philippine General Hospital (UP PGH) Cancer Center and the UP PGH Diliman.

On March 10, 2022, the proposals for the two major infrastructure projects were elevated by the Investment Coordination Committee-Technical Working Group (ICC-TWG) to the ICC Technical Board (ICC-TB) for re-endorsement to the ICC Cabinet Committee (ICC-CC). The ICC-CC is the highest decision-making body in the Executive Branch that approves major capital projects.

Hopes are high for the ICC-CC’s elevation of these priority health projects to the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Board. Once the NEDA Board approves the projects, the bidding for private sector partners will begin.

High-quality and affordable cancer care for poor Filipinos

Cancer affects all age groups and all bodily systems and is now the second leading cause of mortality in the country after diseases of the heart and the vascular system. The UP Manila National Institutes of Health’s Institute of Human Genetics study showed that 189 of every 100,000 Filipinos have cancer. In comparison, four Filipinos die of cancer every hour, or 96 cancer patients every day. In 2020, over 150,000 new cases and 90,000 deaths were recorded[1]. During the first half of 2021, over 27,000 deaths from cancer were recorded by the Philippine Statistics Authority or 9% of the total deaths during this period.

The UP-PGH Cancer Center is the University’s response to cancer care’s growing challenge and complexity. It will be a 200 to 300-bed dedicated cancer center within the University’s Manila campus in Ermita. With at least half of all beds exclusively serving underprivileged Filipinos, the new facility will offer advanced, integrated, and affordable oncology care services to those who cannot otherwise access the kind of treatments available in private hospitals.

The UP-PGH Cancer Center will be structured as a 30-year Build Transfer Operate (“BTO”) arrangement under the Build-Operate-Transfer Law and its Implementing Rules and Regulations. The private partner will design, finance, construct and commission a new standalone hospital building with a dedicated 150-bed area for charity patients and a 50-150 bed area for paying patients. The UP-PGH will provide all clinical services free of charge for charity patients, while the private sector will offer clinical services to paying patients. The private partner will also provide all major equipment, including replacement equipment, and undertake maintenance and management of the facilities and non-clinical services such as cleaning, catering, laundry, and security for the entire hospital under a 30-year PPP concession.

The UP-PGH in northern Metro Manila

The UP PGH is the largest government tertiary hospital in the country and the only national referral center for tertiary care. From its 10-hectare site in the UP Manila campus, and with its 1,100 beds and 400 private beds, the UP PGH provides direct and high-quality medical and healthcare to more than 600,000 patients every year, including thousands indigent Filipinos from all over the country.

But with the growing population of Metro Manila alone, 13.4 million as of 2020 and counting, the UP PGH has been constrained by its limited space and capacity from serving more patients and reaching more communities, especially the underserved communities in northern Metro Manila as well as in nearby provinces. The proposed UP PGH Diliman, to be built on a 4.2-hectare area in the UP Diliman campus in Quezon City, near the Philippine Nuclear Research Institute, is envisioned to fill that gap, making world-class hospital care accessible to more Filipinos, especially the poor.

The UP PGH Diliman will be a 700-bed public tertiary hospital accessible to the poor. It aims to complement and enhance the capacity and services of the original UP PGH in Manila. Drawing on the University’s knowledge and research capacities in many disciplines, from the STEM fields to the social sciences to the arts and humanities, the UP PGH Diliman hopes to be the top research hospital in the country. It will complement and enhance the network of health facilities and specialized hospitals in the Quezon City area.

The UP PGH Diliman will include, among others, an outpatient department building, a main hospital building, a central podium/administration building, a College of Medicine and Research Laboratory building, and a parking building. It will offer the following specialty services:

Genomics and Genomic Research
Neurovascular Surgery and Neurosciences

Can the most significant global public health crisis lead to a reawakening of the greatest human values of altruism, compassion, and trust? According to the speakers at the University of the Philippines’ (UP) 4th Colleges and Universities Public Service Conference (CUPSCon), yes, it can.

The UP Padayon Public Service Office held this year’s CUPSCon on October 21, 2021, via online platforms. The purpose of this conference was to share information with the attendees on the best practices and challenges that come with public service and the direction where future public service is heading.

This year’s theme was “Public Service in Time of COVID: The Role of Academic-Community Partnership in Addressing the Challenges of a Global Pandemic,” which aimed to highlight how the partnerships between academe and other institutions have played a pivotal role in combating and handling the global COVID-19 pandemic and showcasing the various engagements of academe with multiple sectors such as government, civil society, communities, and industries in its pursuit of public service.

In her welcome address, UP Vice President for Public Affairs, Elena E. Pernia noted that within the past 18 months since the beginning of the pandemic, the Filipino public has gone through five forms of emotions: anxiety, empathy, anger, hope, and boredom, with anxiety and empathy being the two most dominant emotions. Different factors played a large part in creating anxiety among Filipinos, such as the government’s handling of the pandemic, information on the virus, and the rising number of positive cases.

“Despite these negative feelings, our struggles with COVID-19 have awakened our innate ability to empathize and to become compassionate,” Pernia said. Various examples of Filipinos exhibiting compassion include donations to frontline workers from prominent individuals and companies, which have gained massive traction from the online community."

The UP Philippine General Hospital (PGH) is not only the country’s biggest and premiere tertiary referral hospital, it is also a University hospital, which is a critical facility for training and research in the service of the country’s public health sector. The PGH being designated by the Department of Health as a COVID-19 tertiary referral center in March 2020 was an affirmation of the government’s regard of the institution for fighting the pandemic.

Since then, PGH has been accepting the most serious cases of COVID-19 infections, while not sacrificing its mandate as a general hospital for the masses. It has shared experience and learnings in the clinical management of the disease, primarily through a weekly public webinar. With its proven expertise, the hospital has been allowed compassionate use of convalescent plasma treatment, which has shown promising results for treating serious COVID-19 infections.

UP-PGH is also now the venue of a pioneering study by the University of the Philippines, “Virgin Coconut Oil (VCO) as Adjunctive Therapy for Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients”, in collaboration with the Philippine Coconut Authority and the Philippine Council for Health Research and Development of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST-PCHRD). The principal investigators are Marissa Alejandria, MD and Leslie Michelle Dalmacio, PhD, both of UP Manila.

The research aims to verify the safety and efficacy of a VCO dosage as a therapy to supplement the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, aged 18 years old and above, admitted at the PGH. Involving more than 75 participants, it began in October 2020. The patients are administered a certain dose of VCO orally.

Patients are observed as regards to primary outcomes such as: recovery or resolution of symptoms and duration of hospital stay; the duration by which symptoms progress to a point where patient may need intensive care unit admission or use of ventilation machine after onset of VCO administration; and, a series of blood test outcomes. The time it takes after the VCO administration until a negative result from an RT-PCR test is also monitored.

The PGH clinical trials come in the heels of earlier research pointing to VCO antimicrobial properties, benefits to the immune system, and relief of inflammatory conditions and other symptoms in mild and suspect COVID-19 cases.

Dr. Fabian Dayrit, Ateneo de Manila University chemistry professor and President of the Integrated Chemists of the Philippines, had led in-vitro research supported by DOST-PCHRD that showed compounds from VCO decrease coronavirus count by 60-90 percent when there is low viral load. The results were announced in October last year, with emphasis on VCO’s capability to boost the body’s immune response against COVID-19.

In an article by the Institute of Food Technologists, Dayrit explains that ingesting VCO results in the body’s production of the compounds he studied, monolaurin and lauric acid. “Together, monolaurin and lauric acid have the physicochemical property of being able to destroy the membrane of lipid-coated viruses,” according to the article.

“What is needed now are clinical trials to validate this and to recommend the amount of intake,” Dayrit says in the article.

To strengthen collaboration between the University of the Philippines (UP) and universities in Taiwan, UP hosted a “homecoming” visit or meeting, the first for this year, at the Balay Kalinaw, UP Diliman, for top officials and delegates from UP and the Edu-Connect Southeast Asia Association on February 5, 2020.

According to UP President Danilo L. Concepcion and Edu-Connect Southeast Asia Association Executive Director Eing-Ming Wu, the visit was a “homecoming” since representatives from the two delegations had already been conducting workshops and meetings in the Philippines and in Taiwan in the past years.

Concepcion said the aim of these meetings was to provide opportunities for discussing academic partnerships, faculty advancement, and academe-industry linkages, among others, that seek to address the two nations’ social issues, to alleviate poverty and inequality, and to stimulate development in the region. He said UP’s relationship with Edu-Connect and their partners “are becoming among the strongest and the most fruitful.”

Alumni email registration launched – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/alumni-email-registration-launched/,"


The University of the Philippines (UP) officially launched its alumni email registration on November 12 in a virtual ceremony titled “Let’s Konek: Taralets!” The Office of Alumni Relations, in partnership with the Information Technology Development Center, spearheads the project. Both are UP System offices.

“UP has been and will always be your home. A home that is not bound by physical space but instead defined by a thought, a feeling, an experience that has transformed you forever. It is an affinity and love for an institution and its community—your community—that gives you Tatak UP.”—UP President Danilo Concepcion, addressing UP alumni. Screenshot from event livestream by Misael Bacani, UP MPRO.

UP President Danilo Concepcion remarked that the long-planned @alum.up.edu.ph email provision to University alumni was finally pushing through after some delays. Addressing the alumni, he said, “Providing you with an email account bearing the initials of your alma mater is one way of showing you our gratitude and appreciation for all that you have given to UP.”

Concepcion added that the gesture might be simple, but he knew it would be meaningful to UP’s hundreds of thousands of alumni. To date, there are more than 300,000 living UP alumni worldwide, and they comprise the largest group of University constituents.

In her message, VP for Public Affairs Elena Pernia talked about UP alumni life stages as a guide for the University to establish and strengthen its relationship with its graduates. She explained that these consider what they might want or need from their alma mater at certain stages of their life as UP alumni and are in line with their circumstances and capacity.

“It is but right that the University gifts its alumni with an exclusive and prestigious email address that shows their continuing affiliation with the University.”—VP for Public Affairs Elena Pernia. Screenshot from event livestream by Misael Bacani, UP MPRO.

Those who are about to graduate may be part of a “Senior Class Gift” campaign. One to 15 years after graduation, those employed and/or have reached middle management levels in their careers may be part of what she called the “Small Gifts, Big Hearts” initiative.

Alumni elevated to senior management positions, roughly 30 years or more after graduating, may give a “Leadership Gift” to UP. Those about to retire or have retired, especially with multi-generational alumni in their families, may consider donating a “Legacy Gift.”

Mr. Pascual congratulated the more than 800 members of UP Manila Class of 2020 on their historic achievement, as well as the faculty, staff and administrators of UP Manila for their quick and decisive actions to help the country battle the COVID-19 pandemic.

He noted that, even before the pandemic, the rapid technological changes brought about by the Fourth Industrial Revolution, or FIRe for short, have brought about disruptions in society, work and labor, and the economy at an unprecedented scale, scope and speed. “We now live in a VUCA world, meaning volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous. This kind of environment is a challenge for many but you, our young graduates can cope. I know you can. You have time on your side, and ability to adapt yourselves to the emerging changes. More importantly, you have the opportunity to become active players in rebuilding our country post-COVID,” he said.

He also compared the UP sablay to the fabric of Filipino society, woven from people’s aspirations, struggles and victories. He exhorted the UP graduates to live a life of service to the country by taking on leadership roles in their chosen fields and weaving meaningful change and transformation. To become good leaders, he added, UP graduates must have humility, integrity, courage, agility, and resilience.

Seeing signs of diminishing social responsibility among students in the early 1990s, UP instituted a program to encourage volunteer service to underserved communities. The underlying belief was that UP’s soul resided in connecting to the people, i.e., public service that went beyond mere fulfillment of requirements to something more integral and committed.

In the University, public service has been a cherished tradition, so much so that news of UP possibly losing its soul caused much consternation and forced a System-led intervention. Thus began the continuing journey of the Pahinungod and the Padayon running well into the new millennium.

But more than promoting altruism or maintaining tradition, scholars say the effort to uphold public service in the University is essential and not just value added to the University’s teaching, learning, and research and development function.

 

A tool of instruction

In a recent study, UP Los Baños researchers noted that “There is a need for research that investigates the instructional effects of volunteer work that simulates and extends the learning-teaching environment using extension (i.e. field work, community engagement) modalities. Such research can elevate its status as a deliberate tool of instruction and likewise, guide its programming and management in this direction.”

Drawing on scientific data, Glenn Lubuguin of Ugnayan ng Pahinungod explained that “We learn from volunteerism and public services the same way communities learn from us. In other words, we get as much, if not more, than what we give. As an institution, we make UP better every time we help make communities better.”

Lubuguin has been studying participants of University-led public service initiatives and has gained much from their individual insights.

However, his studies manifest the need to scientifically establish a connection of community service to the mental development of the volunteers as “scholars of the nation.” It is the University contributing to culture-specific, localized knowledge-making on volunteerism and the Iskolar ng Bayan.

In 2012, Lubuguin finished the study “Perceived Effects of Volunteer Experience on Values and Skills Development among UPLB Pahinungod Volunteers.” It drew on the experience of 74 volunteers who participated in six Pahinungod programs.

The study highlighted positive values developed among volunteers, but Lubuguin noted that these had yet to be connected to improved leadership or management style or application in larger socio-political fields.

“For instance, firsthand experiences in underserved communities amplify volunteers’ appreciation of social inequalities and government inefficiency and consequently increased cynicism for public institutions that may not be healthy for active citizenship,” Lubuguin said.  He observed that constructive values like interdependence, cooperation, receptivity, merging, and compromise learned from community engagement often conflict with Western leadership styles which value self-assertion and independence.

Researchers came up with another study, mindful of the need to align volunteerism with UP goals. They went into a more structured, qualitative study on the development of mental constructs before and after the performance of public service, involving UP volunteers and other state colleges and universities (SUCs). This resulted in the paper “Emergent Constructs among Volunteers of Selected Southern Tagalog SUCs” by Lubuguin, Dr. Pamela Custodio, and Jose Limbay Lahi Espaldon.

The study involved 22 reflection papers and three debriefing sessions of 21 participants from Ugnayan ng Pahinungod, and three focus-group discussions among selected volunteers of UP Los Baños, Southern Luzon State University in Quezon, and Batangas State University.

In his welcome remarks, Concepcion marked the historical significance of the day, which was also the same day that the new chancellor of UP Diliman was selected by the Board of Regents.

In-announce kaninang hapon ni Regent Laurel na kung may bus na kayo, baka kailangan ninyo ng coaster. Coaster naman. (In addition, Regent Laurel announced this afternoon that, since we already have a bus, what we need now is a coaster),” Concepcion added, referring to Regent Laurel’s own pledge to UP.

“Sa aking pagkakatanda, huli tayong nag-champion in 1986,” Concepcion went on. “Pero magcha-champion tayo during my term. At kapag ganito ang suporta na pinapakita sa atin ng ating mga alumni at mga kaibigan, sa palagay ko hindi na tatagal at magna-number one na tayo sa UAAP.” (From what I can remember, we won the championship back in 1986. But we will be champions again during my term. And if this is how our alumni and friends support us, I believe it won’t be long until we are number one in the UAAP.)

When a delegation from the University of the Philippines Medical Alumni Society in America (UPMASA) visited President Danilo L. Concepcion on February 21 at the Board of Regents Room in Quezon Hall, UP Diliman, proposals of assistance for the improvement of facilities in the UP Los Baños Health Service or Infirmary, and support for the planned establishment of the Philippine General Hospital (PGH) in UP Diliman were discussed.

Concepcion expressed his desire to strengthen the UPLB Infirmary since it is the nearest government health facility in that part of Laguna that caters to thousands of patients, where minor surgical operations are also performed, especially for caesarean section (CS) births and other emergency cases. He lamented the worn out facilities for surgery, lack of equipment such as for CT scans, and limited accommodation for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients.  The doctors from UPMASA offered to help upgrade UPLB’s operating room. Donation of an operating microscope was also mentioned."

Two world-class infrastructures to be used as safe spaces for academic activities and services in the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman were inaugurated on February 9: the new seven-story Student Union Building and the renovated Vinzons Hall. Officials of UP and the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), under the leadership of UP President Danilo L. Concepcion, former DPWH Secretary Mark A. Villar, and DPWH Undersecretary for NCR Rafael C. Yabut, who represented DPWH Secretary Roger G. Mercado, graced the event.

Concepcion said the Student Union Building is an ideal venue for student activities. It would become the home of TVUP, the University Student Council, the Philippine Collegian, the Office of Student Projects and Activities (OSPA), the University Food Service, and UP-based student organizations.

The rehabilitated Vinzons Hall, on the other hand, will house units under the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs (OVCSA), which includes the Office of Student Projects and Activities (OSPA), the Office for Student Ethics (OSE), the Office of Scholarships and Grants (OSG), the Office of Counselling and Guidance (OCG).

Vinzons Hall’s renovation ensures its structural integrity, safety, and efficient use of space. The makeover also includes an upgrade of its electrical, plumbing, and security systems.

A scenic elevator and security cameras were also installed.

President Concepcion added that Vinzons Hall and the old student union building housed G. Miranda Bookstore, where UP students bought textbooks and school supplies when he was still a student. Government scholars received their monthly allowance at the old Philippine National Bank (PNB) branch in the area. For him, the inauguration of the two buildings ushers in a new beginning for today’s UP students.

“We build upon the strong foundations set by our predecessors because it is what our constituents deserve,” Concepcion said. “Ang pagpapasinaya natin ngayon ay bunga ng ating kolektibong hangarin na pagbutihin pa ang mga espasyong hihikayat sa husay at galing ng ating mga estudyante tungo sa paglilingkod sa bayan [This inauguration is the product of our collective desire to improve the spaces that will nurture the skills and talents of our students and harness these toward service to the country],” he concluded.

UP Diliman Chancellor Fidel R. Nemenzo thanked the DPWH and Pres. Concepcion for all their efforts. He said the Vinzons Hall and the Student Union Building would continue to serve among the epicenters of student activities and symbols of the University.

Former DPWH Secretary Villar said a world-class institution like UP deserves world-class infrastructure. He is proud and happy to have been part of these projects. He supports President Concepcion’s vision for UP to become a top university globally, not just in Asia.

UPD Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Louise Jashil R. Sonido said they were excited to come home to these buildings. She said, “The past years of remote learning emphasized how much the learning environment and spaces contribute to the formation and education of our students. When we build for our students, we enable so many experiences, opportunities, relations, the incubation of new ideas and initiatives that serve the people.” She concluded her message by saying that they expected the new and next normal for students to be a better one."

She always cleaned the fish her mother Amelia bought. It was a chore she loved doing. Little did the young Raquel Barros Del Rosario know she was preparing for a future as Dr. Raquel B. Del Rosario-Fortun, the first Filipino woman forensic pathologist.

“Evisceration! That’s what it was,” she said with a knowing smile, connecting that childhood task with disemboweling bodies during autopsies. She had always wanted to become a doctor despite coming from a clan of lawyers and admitted that her father Benjamin was “a bit disappointed.”

It was her doting aunt, Dr. Lourdes Del Rosario, who inspired Raquel. Her photo is the only one on Raquel’s desk at the Department of Pathology chairperson’s office, UP Manila College of Medicine (UPCM). “Because of her, I associated fun with being a doctor.” Even going with her to a hospital in Tondo, Raquel wasn’t fazed. “That hospital smell didn’t bother me. I saw all these doctors in white coats like her, respected by everyone. I thought it was so cool.”

Dreams vs. reality

Going into college, she wanted something that could be a pre-med degree but could also guarantee employment if she couldn’t pursue medicine because it was expensive.

She enrolled in the UP Diliman (UPD) BS Psychology program in 1979 after graduating from the UP Integrated School. Three years on, she felt certain she wanted to be a doctor. She “wanted to shift to a pre-med program focused on the sciences like Biology or Zoology,” but chose to be more practical and finished psychology.

Raquel wasn’t accepted to UPCM, so she went to the University of the East Ramon Magsaysay (UERM) College of Medicine, graduating in 1987 and completing post-internship in 1988. She began residency training in anatomic and clinical pathology in 1989 at UPCM, where she was also made instructor.

The medicine-law mix

While the pull of medicine was stronger, law was also Raquel’s interest. She saw the possibility of mixing both through Dr. Pedro Solis, a lawyer-doctor and her UERM Legal Medicine professor.

She took and passed the law aptitude exam of the UPD College of Law (UP Law) twice, in 1989 and 1993. UPCM just advised against the pursuit in 1989 because it was her first year of residency. “Passing twice, I thought I might have an aptitude for law after all.”

Raquel laughed when recounting her law experience. “I quit! After 10 days, maybe 2 weeks, I just quit! This is so embarrassing, but that’s what happened. Law wasn’t for me.” She found it “too abstract, the opposite of medicine’s tangible and concrete.” She may have quit, but more than ten years later, she was invited by UP Law to teach. “I believe some eyebrows were raised, that I, a non-lawyer, was teaching a course at UP Law.”

She learned about forensic pathology from one of her seniors at the department. “I realized it was probably what I was looking for: the field of medicine, particularly pathology, applied to law. The tangible applied to the abstract.”

Raquel went to Seattle, Washington in 1994 to train at the King County Medical Examiner’s (ME) Office. “My first day there, I fell in love with forensic pathology. That was it. I knew it was the field I was meant to be in.” She had the stomach for it, too—dead bodies, whether fresh or decomposing, with maggots or reduced to skeletal remains.

 

Heartaches and headaches

She vividly remembers the day she left. It was a Sunday. She and her husband Vincent, an obstetrician-gynecologist, left their three-year-old daughter Lisa playing at her paternal grandmother’s place. Raquel cried so hard the night before that she almost didn’t want to leave. “It was very difficult.”

When she wasn’t examining bodies and collecting evidence at the ME’s office, Raquel would feel terribly homesick. She racked up a massive bill on overseas calls in her first month and was forced to cut down—ten minutes on Saturdays."
Nowhere to go but the baryo – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/nowhere-to-go-but-the-baryo/,"


So what’s a tall 26-year-old bachelor doing in the scenic but remote municipality of San Isidro, Bohol, a town of rice fields, banana and coconut groves, 32 kilometers away from Tagbilaran City?

Adrian Sampang is no stranger to the town’s 9,800 people, being the only doctor-to-the-barrio (DTTB) assigned in the community for the past eight months.

Shortly after his graduation, the young Kapampangan passed the medical board examination in September 2016, then went straight to the DTTB program of the Department of Health, along with 81 doctors from various medical schools who signed a two-year contract in November 2016.

From the baryo

A probinsyano himself, Adrian had lived a simple life growing up in Lubao, Pampanga. “I thought I had my life planned out for me—go to a local college on a local scholarship, then spend the rest of my life working in an office. I’m lucky that I got these awards and scholarships from elementary all the way to high school, but I never planned my future,” he says.

However, his exposure to the health situation in the Philippines is rooted in his childhood. “I often got sick because I had asthma. I saw the bad situation in the district hospital – crowded, inefficient, long lines, dilapidated facilities. I didn’t want to be a doctor after that. It was my first actual experience seeking medical attention,” he says.

A UP education

Back in 2006, his mom filled up his UPCAT form. Since Nursing was the trendy program then, his mom made it his first choice, and Behavioral Science his second. He called it luck passing the latter course.

“I might have not gone to med school if I had passed Nursing,” he recalls. He became an active member of seven organizations, including the Student Council for ASAP-Katipunan. His program, which delved into the social sciences especially Anthropology, took him closer to the realities of Philippine society.

“As any Iskolar ng Bayan knows, a UP education is very different. They make sure that you at least get exposed to these social issues, then it is up to you to explore them more,” he adds. “We went to farmers and urban poor communities. Actually, my internship was with the Philippine Human Rights Information Center, a non-government organization. We did research on human rights abuses such as militarization in the countryside and on mining. We joined protest rallies. Once, we stayed with a community of sugarcane farmers in Batangas for a week to discuss their health situation,” he says.

Secretly, he applied for a scholarship in med school. He passed and finished his studies, the first UP graduate in his family to do so. He was part of the first batch affected by the University’s calendar shift, which put interns at the Philippine General Hospital preparing for the medical board examinations on a tight schedule."

The University of the Philippines’ history of public service antedates the UP Charter of 2008, which declares UP as a “public service university.” The UP Charter of 2008 (RA 9500) mandates that UP as the national university shall “lead as a public service university by providing various forms of community, public and volunteer service, as well as scholarly and technical assistance to the government, the private sector, and civil society, while maintaining its standards of excellence.”

In postwar Philippines, the University of the Philippines was already engaged in community work by serving the poor and the needy, especially the victims of World War II. In 1966, then UP President Carlos P. Romulo (1962-68), in a speech before the University Council, called for the nationalization of knowledge and pushed for Filipino scholarship to benefit fellow Filipinos.

But it was during the creation of the UP Pahinun­god in 1993 when the university took an active role in voluntarism. Pahinungod is a Visayan term which means “offering” or dedication to a noble purpose. The UP Pahinungod under President Emil Q. Javier (1993-1999) envisaged a generation of UP students and graduates who would offer their talents and dedicate themselves to voluntarism as responsible citizens of the nation. But the UP Pahinungod System Office did not last long and was devolved to the different Constituent Universities.

 

A scene from the Padayon Workshop held on October 24, 2017. (Photo by Jun Madrid, UP MPRO)

 

In 2012, the UP Padayon Public Service Office under the Office of the Vice President for Public Affairs was established by President Alfredo E. Pascual (2011-2017). Its first Director, Dr. Ferdinand Llanes, described the new office as having a “much broader parameter for public service [than Pahinungod], which includes initiatives of both volunteer and non-volunteer in nature (research extension, second- ment to state agencies, medical internships, training projects, and so forth, and so on).” Under the directorship of Llanes, Padayon’s central goal was to “generate and mobilize expertise in the service of the nation” which he considered part of what is otherwise known in the Asian region as a “scholarship of engagement.”

From “community engagement” in postwar Philippines to “a scholarship of engagement” in the new millennium, it is not surprising to find numerous and various forms of public service in the university. A significant number of public service initiatives across CUs however, are not documented, reported and tracked. The next UP Padayon Director, Nelson Cainghog, therefore embarked on a project to standardize and systematize public service reporting through the UP Handbook Online Project.

Beyond teaching and research, how can universities and colleges serve the public better?

 

Joane V. Serrano, PhD: Director, Information, Office Multimedia Center UP Open University

 

The University of the Philippines Open University (UPOU) has always believed that public service cuts across its teaching and research functions. In its 23 years of existence, UPOU has tried to integrate public service in its core functions and major activities. UPOU is uniquely posi­tioned to serve the public better through its thrust and mandate of widening access to quality education, especially to sectors that are not normally reached by other constituent units of the UP System.

To surface the importance of public service, UPOU established openUP—one of its flagship programs that focuses on widening access to continuing profes­sional education; providing digital opportunities to communities; providing venues for discussion of relevant issues in the society; and providing technical assistance to higher educational institu­tions (HEIs), local government, people’s organizations and civil society. With the enactment of Republic Act 10650 (Open Distance Learning Act), UPOU has been given a crucial task of assisting relevant national agencies, HEIs and technical and vocational institutions in developing their distance education programs through training, technical assistance, research and other academic programs.

Breakthrough: Extinct giant rodents discovered in the Philippines – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/breakthrough-extinct-giant-rodents-discovered-in-the-philippines/,"

Three giant cloud rat species were discovered to have lived in the Philippines simultaneously as the oldest human species (Homo luzonensis) found in the country. But two of the rodents went extinct only after 2,000 years ago.

A team from the University of the Philippines (UP), the Philippine National Museum, and the Field Museum of Natural History of the USA have since 2017 studied fossil remains sifted from the earth in several caves in northern Luzon from which they discovered the three extinct species unique to the Philippines.

The discovery was recently published in the Journal of Mammalogy. Read the full article here.

“These are three previously unknown species from an unusual group of rodents, locally known as buot or bugkun, and known in English as giant cloud rats, that live only in the Philippines,” says Dr. Janine Ochoa, Assistant Professor of Anthropology of UP Diliman and lead author of the journal paper.

According to the co-author, Dr. Lawrence Heaney, Negaunee Curator of Mammals at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago: “The two that became extinct [more recently] were giants among rodents, both weighing about a kilogram. They were big enough that it might have been worthwhile to hunt and eat them.”

“These giant rats and their relatives are members of an ancient branch on the tree of life that arrived from the Asian mainland about 14 million years ago and live only in the Philippines,” says co-author Marian Reyes, a zooarcheologist at the National Museum of the Philippines.

She describes the buot typically as living in trees and eating leaves, buds, and seeds. She also says that all of them have furry or fluffy tails and striking fur colors.

The scientific names of the three new species of fossil cloud rats were chosen using vernacular terms from Philippine languages. The largest of the fossil cloud rats is Carpomys dakal, named so because it is much larger compared to the known living species in the same genus, Carpomys melanurus and Carpomys phaeurus. Dakal means big or large in several languages in northern Luzon, including in the Itawes, Ibanag and Agta languages. The second fossil species, Crateromys ballik, is slightly smaller than the living Crateromys species on Luzon, Crateromys schadenbergi. Ballik means small in the Dupaningan Agta language. The third species, Batomys cagayanensis, is named after the place where the archaeological sites are located, the Cagayan region of northeastern Luzon.

At a crossroads with humans

According to the researchers, the newly recorded fossil species came from Callao Cave and several adjacent smaller caves in Peñablanca, Cagayan Province. Some specimens of all three of the new fossil rodents occurred in the same deep layer in the Callao Cave where the Homo luzonensis, an endemic human species, was discovered in 2019 to have lived about 67,000 years ago.

Dr. Deo Florence L. Onda, a microbial oceanographer who is Associate Professor and Deputy Director for Research of the Marine Science Institute (MSI) in the University of the Philippines Diliman, makes history as the first and only Filipino and one of the first two human beings to make the first manned descent into Emden Deep, the third deepest point on Earth.

The Emden Deep is located in the Philippine trench and is approximately 34,100 feet or 10,400 meters. On March 23, the explorers made touchdown at 10,045 meters deep. Watch the historic moment here.

According to a press release by the UPMSI, Dr. Onda was invited by the private organization Caladan Oceanic to join the Emden Deep Expedition, to be held from March 22 to 28, 2021. The expedition is being carried out on board the DSSV Pressure Drop, described as the only marine vessel in the world designed to endure such missions and to carry humans to the deepest parts of the world’s oceans.

Dr. Onda joins an American undersea explorer, Victor Vescovo, who according to the UP MSI, is “the current record holder of the deepest manned descent in the Marianas Trench in 2019” and is the “main sponsor of Caladan Oceanic, which . . . has been setting records for deepest manned descents in the world’s deepest trenches, with the most recent one in the Marianas in 2019”.

Dr. Onda and his companions started the voyage from the port of Guam to the Philippine Trench. This activity has been fully coordinated with the Philippine Government through the Department of Foreign Affairs and is considered a non-Marine Scientific Research (MSR) activity.

According to the UPMSI press release: “Part of the goal is to wave the Philippine Flag in the Emden Deep during its record-setting voyage, highlighting that it is an integral part of our nation’s heritage. Dr. Onda, as the sole Filipino researcher representing the country, will also be given a unique opportunity to be exposed to state-of-the-art vessels capable of deep-sea activities, which can enrich our experiences and knowledge as the Philippines builds its own National Academic Research Fleet (NARFleet), an ongoing national project funded by the Philippine Government. This endeavor can spark interest and passion for many other young Filipinos who would want to make a career in the sciences and bring more attention to the protection, preservation, and conservation of the Philippine marine environment.”

Dr. Onda and Mr. Vescovo are joined by a capable crew and expedition team that includes several Filipino members.

"Fire at the frontlines: UP PGH staff step up to save lives, awarded the Order of Lapu-Lapu for their bravery and heroism – University of the Philippines",https://up.edu.ph/fire-at-the-frontlines-up-pgh-staff-step-up-to-save-lives-awarded-the-order-of-lapu-lapu-for-their-bravery-and-heroism/,"

Photo from the Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO).

 

In this COVID-19 crisis, hospital workers are critical to humanity’s health and survival. When a disaster strikes on top of an already overwhelming public health crisis, the pressure of a zero-casualty goal weighs even heavier on doctors, nurses, aides, utility workers, security personnel, and responders.

The May 16 fire at the UP Philippine General Hospital (UP PGH), the largest COVID-19 referral facility, tested the mettle of its employees and proved they were ready and willing to go beyond the call of duty. It was their genuine desire to save lives that spurred them to think fast and remain calm. These effectively diffused panic and encouraged cooperation from patients and watchers to evacuate in an orderly manner.

The heart of heroism and the spirit of service exemplified by its employees, and UP PGH’s Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Plan (DRRMP), with pandemic protocols in place, ensured that no one died from the blaze that broke out past midnight.

Stepping up and stepping in

Dr. Rodney Dofitas, who heads manpower support in the UP PGH COVID-19 Crisis Team, happened to be in the hospital when the fire started in the Operating Room Sterilization Area (ORSA) on the third floor of the Central Block.

No, he was not on duty at the time. He had been with his aunt who sadly passed away a few hours before the fire. He was in the elevator when, upon the door opening at the third floor, he heard loud voices. When he went out to investigate, he saw smoke spilling out onto the hallway outside ORSA. The Crisis Team had to be informed, but his phone was barely hanging on to battery life.

 

Dr. Rodney B. Dofitas, Head of the Manpower Support, PGH COVID Crisis Team (below), speaks during the May 23 episode of the UP “Stop COVID Deaths” webinar. Watch the episode on TVUP’s YouTube channel.

 

A quick charge and messages sent to the Team, Dofitas knew he had to take charge until UP PGH Director Gerardo Legaspi arrived. He also knew where to find someone crucial to managing the emergency because Dofitas had seen him hours before.

Safety Officer Joel Santiago was in his hospital bed when Dofitas returned to his room. Only, it was not like his visit earlier that evening. Dressed in his hospital gown, Santiago did not hesitate to get up, put on pants and boots, and go into action.

Dofitas and Santiago worked with the firefighters on the scene.

In another part of the hospital, at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), nurse Kathrina Bianca Macababbad was bathing the babies in her care when she was alerted to the fire on the floor below. Wasting no time, she fought back her fear and with fellow nurses, started the priority evacuation of the 35 babies in NICU.

The healthier ones, those who were breathing on their own and could be transported in emergency vests, were brought down first. Refusing to leave any baby behind, she and nurse Jomar Mallari rushed back and forth from the ground to the fourth floors to rescue babies on mechanical ventilators, then babies who were intubated.

All babies were saved.

Dofitas, Santiago, Macababbad, and Mallari, along with UP PGH residents, Dr. Earle Ceo Abrenica and Dr. Alexandra Lee; Safety Officer Ramil Ranoa; NICU nurses Esmeralda Ninto and Phoebe Rose Malabanan; and, nurse and volunteer firefighter Quintin Bagay Jr., were conferred the Order of Lapu-Lapu by President Rodrigo Duterte on June 2 for their heroism. The Order of Lapu-Lapu is conferred upon those who accomplished extraordinary acts of service and exceptional contributions to the country.

Collective effort

While they received the recognition, the UP Manila (UPM) and UP PGH leadership emphasized that it was everyone at the hospital that helped avert what could have been a more disastrous fire had it claimed lives.

UPM Chancellor Carmencita Padilla said that in her 43-year stay at UPM and UP PGH, there have been three fire incidents, including the one that happened on May 16. All three took place at night, evacuation had to be undertaken, and all were zero-casualty incidents. Every evacuation carried out by responders and personnel, she said, “is an offering of their lives,” and she expressed gratitude to and lauded the brave and selfless actions of UP PGH staff and the firefighters.

 

UP PGH Director Gerardo “Gap” Legaspi (below) speaks during the May 23 episode of the UP “Stop COVID Deaths” webinar. Watch the episode on TVUP’s YouTube channel.

 

“The best asset of UP-PGH is its people,” Legaspi emphasized. The hospital director declared he was “indebted to [all] the personnel” because it was their collective action, their bayanihan, that saved everyone. Bayanihan was also at work after the fire. UP PGH received a deluge of support, from other hospitals taking in PGH patients to providing industrial fans and equipment that helped dissipate smoke inside the building, from donating respirators and masks to food and drink, and even money.

People first, property second. These were Legaspi’s priority concerns when he arrived at the hospital less than an hour after he received news of the fire. He scoured all levels of the Central Block to check that everyone had been evacuated before working with responders and hospital personnel to move equipment out of danger. He estimated the damage at around P50 million.

Dofitas added that it was the cooperation between UP PGH personnel, responders, patients, and watchers, all following the hospital’s preparedness plan, which ensured that no one perished in the fire and that damage was limited to property.

“We knew what to do because we had regular drills,” Santiago said. This, on top of an updated disaster risk management plan that incorporated the health safety protocols of the pandemic. Appropriate evacuation areas had been identified. COVID-19 patients were separated from non-COVID-19 cases."
UP faculty discusses return to face-to-face classes this semester – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/up-faculty-discusses-return-to-face-to-face-classes-this-semester/,"


A subcommittee of the University of the Philippines Presidential Advisory Council (UP PAC) expounded on guidelines for the safe return to face-to-face classes in the wake of the pandemic during an online UP System-wide faculty summit on February 28, 2022.

The summit resulted from Memorandum 2021-169 from the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs (OVPAA) on December 16, 2021, with the subject: “Guidelines on the gradual re-opening of UP campuses beginning Second Semester AY 2021-2022”.

The memorandum confirmed that UP residential campuses are gradually re-opening for the Second Semester of AY 2021-2022, “specifically for courses in the curriculum for which face-to-face classes or activities are necessary to achieve the stipulated learning outcomes.”

Photos of UP Diliman’s Palma Hall before (top) and during the pandemic (bottom). With the coming 2nd semester of AY 2021-2022, the University is calibrating guidelines for the gradual return to limited face-to-face classes across the UP System and at least some of UP’s students to Palma Hall and UP’s other academic buildings. Photos by Misael Bacani (top) and Bong Arboleda (bottom), UPMPRO.

UP Los Baños Chancellor Jose Camacho Jr., chair of the PAC Sub-Committee for the University’s Preparations for Face-to-Face Classes, said that face-to-face classes allowed under COVID Alert Level 3 or lower, the subcommittee had recommended limited practice of face-to-face courses of “the shortest duration possible.”

Camacho said the top priority is given to graduating students who must do field or laboratory work for their thesis or dissertation, followed by students in their last academic year who are required to train for their licensure examinations. Next are students in their penultimate year before graduation who need skills training in the laboratory, field, studio, etc. The last priority is for students in any academic year who need skills training in the laboratory, field, studio, etc.

UPLB Chancellor and head of the UP PAC Sub-Committee for the University’s Preparations for Face-to-Face Classes Jose Camacho, Jr. presents some general guidelines for the gradual re-opening of all of UP’s campuses. Misael Bacani (UP MPRO) took the screenshot during the UP System-wide Faculty Summit on the Gradual Re-opening of Campuses held on February 28, 2022, via Zoom.

According to the OVPAA memorandum, “the rest of the courses will continue to be delivered remotely, mixing synchronous (online) and asynchronous learning, guided by the course learning outcomes.”

“The faculty shall continue to prepare course packs—detailed course guide, learning resources, activity/study guide—for all courses to be offered in the Second Semester AY 2021-2022,” the memorandum added.

The PAC subcommittee said that for the face-to-face classes, a student-shifting cycle in facilities should be in place, which would allow a “fallow” time of at least 15 minutes between uses by separate groups of students. Before this, they should have determined the allowable capacity for each facility; and given such, decided if sections or classes would be split.

The campuses should also be working on:

Spaces for internet connectivity of students
A daily health monitoring system and curfew times, as well as a system on physical requirements, screening, and travel
Instructions on public health control and protocols for posting, as well as guidelines for conduct of on-campus students, guests, and the public in accessing UP facilities; and
Guides and plans for general use of facilities, on-site activities, and food concessionaires

National guidelines

Based on guidelines from the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) on returning to face-to-face classes, previewed during a December 1, 2021 press conference, UP and other higher educational institutions (HEIs) under Alert Levels 1 to 3 needed only to conduct a self-assessment on their readiness to re-open campuses for limited face-to-face classes, submit a copy of the checklist to their respective regional offices with a Notarized Affidavit of Undertaking, and obtain a clearance from the local government unit.

The CHED also reiterated the provision in the earlier CHED-DOH Joint Memorandum Circular No. 2021-001, released on February 10, 2021, stating that students participating in face-to-face classes must be registered in the HEI/health facility with PhilHealth or equivalent medical insurance that covers COVID-related expenses. Only fully vaccinated students, faculty members, and HEI personnel would be allowed to participate in the classes.

The more recent CHED-DOH Joint Memorandum Circular No. 2021-004 released on December 15, 2021, was presented by UP Diliman Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs Maria Theresa Payongayong. The circular added that minimum public health standards must be observed, and HEIs must facilitate health responses for students getting infected. Prerequisites include the establishment of crisis management committees and cyclical student-shifting systems."

The NOAH Center was formerly Project NOAH of the Department of Science and Technology. It was adopted by the University and re-established as the NOAH Center in March 2017 through EO PDLC 17-03 issued by UP President Danilo Concepcion, when the project’s operations were concluded the previous month. In June 2017, UPRI was re-launched with the NOAH Center as its core program.

Delegates of the Eastern Regional Organization for Public Administration (EROPA) coming from Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Nepal, Vietnam, India, China, Hong Kong, and the Philippines gathered for the EROPA 2019 General Assembly and Conference to discuss vital issues affecting the Asia and the Pacific region, elect officers of the organization, and adopt resolutions and plans for upcoming activities. This was held at the International Center for Public Administration (ICPA) of the National College of Public Administration and Governance (NCPAG), University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman, Quezon City on September 22 to 27.

With the main theme, “The Future of Public Administration: Rethinking Resilience, Equity, and Sustainability in the Region”, the conference featured plenary discussions, paper presentations, and parallel sessions on four sub-themes, namely: Social Equity and Well-Being; Environmental Sustainability; Public Finance and the Good Life; and, The Fourth Industrial Revolution and Development.  Participants were engaged in scholarly and timely discussions on a very broad range of topics which covered: food and water security, agrarian reform, labor, education, economics, entrepreneurship, finance, bureaucracy, civil society, disaster risk reduction and management, climate change, and many others connected with meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the United Nations’ agenda for international development.

UP President Danilo L. Concepcion, EROPA Secretary-General Orlando S. Mercado, and NCPAG Officer-in-Charge Simeon A. Ilago welcomed the delegates in the opening ceremony on September 23. Ilago encouraged the delegates to “rethink, learn and unlearn, discover and rediscover, frame and reframe ideas and actions that will help shape the future of the study and practice of Public Administration.” Concepcion affirmed that the conference “complements and fulfills the mandate of both the academe and of EROPA.” He added that addressing the problem of climate change “would require serious transformation in how we manage our affairs and our resources, in addition to the already challenging complexities brought about by globalization, changes in technologies, and human activities.”  Mercado shared insights from his experiences as a former Philippine senator and reminded the participants to look closer at the details in trying to find solutions to the issues, or in seeing the “gorillas” likely being overlooked.

The first plenary session featured presentations by Professor Jomo Kwame Sundaram, senior adviser of the Khazanah Research Institute, Malaysia, and Professor Pan Suk Kim of the College of Business and Governance, Yonsei University, Korea, on “the future of Public Administration”. An open forum followed, moderated by UP NCPAG Professor Ma. Victoria R. Raquiza. Sundaram urged the audience “to address the problems that we have inherited” in his discussion on good governance. He said that: “we should think about developmental governance”; face global warming with idea of a “global green new deal”; “reduce climate change while raising living standards for all people”; and, “strengthen stakeholders” in implementing a school feeding program to solve hunger and malnutrition. “As public administrators you have the potential to make sure that our governments’ collective commitment to the SDGs enable us to improve the conditions of living for the vast majority of our people,” concluded Sundaram.  Kim highlighted the shifting of discourse from Western to Asian, the need for connectivity, and the use of technology. “We have to improve Asian public administration. . .  We have to have our own theory,” he said. This is through “Asianization” or localization, so that “we can interpret our own problems in our own ways”, he added. “We can learn a lot from each other so we can transform Asian public administration to more creative innovation. We need to develop our own indigenous or localized or Asian way. We need to promote innovative culture. Innovative culture is having innovation in every workplace,” concluded Kim.

Film Scores Music to Your Eyes
January 14, 2019 by Stephanie Cabigao

How did scenes in the film Heneral Luna rekindle our patriotic and nationalistic sensibilities? Or how did a line in the song “Bituing Walang Ningning” draw the Filipino audience to that showdown moment between Dorina and Lavinia in the movie of the same title? Most moviegoers probably don’t know it, but it’s the music that gives depth to cinematic storytelling.

UP Fighting Maroons conquer NU Bulldogs for a back-to-back win – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/up-fighting-maroons-conquers-nu-bulldogs-for-a-back-to-back-win/,"


It’s another nail-biter, one-point lead win for the UP Fighting Maroons against the winless NU Bulldogs, just days after Adamson’s Soaring Falcons suffered the same fate in the previous game. The Mall of Asia Arena filled with a majority of maroon-wearing audience bore witness to this back-to-back victory on September 18 that moves the UP Men’s Basketball Team to the second spot in the men’s basketball first round standings.

UP fought a hard game to defeat NU, as the Bulldogs were determined to bag its first win by starting off the first quarter with a 5-point lead. Coming back in the second quarter in a more aggressive play, the Fighting Maroons scored 44 points, an 8-point lead ahead of the Bulldogs’ 36 points with the help of UP Forward Javi Gomez De Liaño firing consistent 3-pointers in the quarter. And in the third quarter, the Fighting Maroons maintained an 8-point lead with 67 points against 59 points by NU’s Bulldogs.

Until the game reached the fourth quarter, NU’s Dave Ildefonso redeemed the team from UP’s continued 10-point lead by closing in a one-point deficit at 74-71, with 3:27 left in the final stretch. The next ball maneuvers got even more intense with a shooting streak coming from Akhuetie and Paras making UP maintain the lead with 78-71.

A nail-biter finish was just in order when NU’s Enzo Joson and Dave Ildefonso responded with their sure-fire buckets to close the gap with only 4 points behind, 78-74 at 32.3 seconds. Akhuetie’s free throw recovery of his missed charities against Ildefonso’s freebies and solid three-pointer all led to a heart stopper one-point lead by the Fighting Maroons, 80-79 with 11.6 ticks left.

The game clincher was the foul called out on Ildefonso that sent UP Forward David Murrell to the free throw line. However, he missed his 2-point free throw opportunity. As NU favored the last draw to the goal, John Lloyd Clemente failed to cash in the bucket. Akhuetie swiftly charged for ball possession as the buzzer called off the game.

It’s a winning streak for the Fighting Maroons. The victory against UE is a break to the one-point lead cycle of wins for the UP Men’s Basketball Team. Fresh out of a win against the NU Bulldogs, the UP Men’s Basketball Team was back at it again, sweeping UE’s Red Warriors at the Ynares Center, Antipolo, Rizal on Saturday, September 21.

At the jump ball, manning the Fighting Maroons were Jun Manzo, Kobe Paras, Bright Akhuetie, Javier Gomez de Liaño and Jaydee Tungcab. It was an easy start for the team on the first quarter of the game with a dynamic rotation of players earning an eight-point lead with 23 against 15.

The second quarter consisted of a heavy rotation of players for the Fighting Maroons. A highlight of this period was Paras’ power block. At 1:38 on the clock, UP led the quarter with 35 points ahead of UE’s 25 points.

Akhuetie’s sure fire bucket points and free throws put up for UP to close the quarter in its biggest lead of the game by 12 points with 39 to 27.

In the third quarter, the 12-point lead of the Fighting Maroons was brought to a stagnating state. Meanwhile, the UE Red Warriors stepped up to compensate for the 12-point deficit. Picking up the momentum was the consistent triple shot play by Jojo Antiporda.  It was also Alex Diakhite’s layup that survived the team’s fate in the quarter. The Red Warriors came close with 42 points, only 4 points behind the Fighting Maroons’ 46 points.

"Padayon Public Service stages #ThatsMyBay, highlights UP initiatives towards Manila Bay rehab – University of the Philippines",https://up.edu.ph/padayon-public-service-stages-thatsmybay-highlights-up-initiatives-towards-manila-bay-rehab/,"


“Coincidentally it is 157 years ago today , September 23, 1762, that the British flotilla landed in Manila Bay, marking the start of the British invasion of the Philippines. These days, there is another kind of battle waging once again in Manila Bay – a struggle to clean up and rehabilitate it. This new battle is an offshoot of a 1999 lawsuit, launched by a group of concerned citizens and law students on behalf of Mother Nature against the government. In 2008, after more than a decade of equal battle, the Supreme Court decided in favor of Mother Nature, directing the DENR and 12 other government agencies to clean up, rehabilitate and restore the bay and make it fit for swimming, skin diving and all other forms of contact recreation,” UP Vice President for Public Affairs Elena E. Pernia stated as she opened the public forum, #ThatsMyBay, in her welcoming remarks.

“A whole society approach is necessary to achieve, as the Supreme Court stated, for the return of Manila Bay to its former glory—a remarkable natural endowment that is a source of food, employment, income, transportation, recreation, beauty, culture, and history,” Pernia added.

The forum was one of the series of activities organized by UP Padayon Public Service Office headed by its Director Jeanette L. Yasol-Naval to showcase its commitment to align the various University efforts and facilitate significant endeavors, such as the creation of a research and development agenda and the mobilization of research funding in relation to the programs lined up for the Manila Bay rehabilitation.

Science experts, government officials, and professors and students packed the forum at the Institute of Environmental Science and Meteorology Auditorium in UP Diliman. It featured UP initiatives to keep Manila Bay sustainable.

The UP Padayon Public Service Office gathered UP experts involved in Manila Bay’s rehabilitation and restoration projects. UP’s very own former UPLB Chancellor Rex Victor O. Cruz, a leading consultant of the Manila Bay Sustainable Development Master Plan project conducted by the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), provided an overview of the project’s status and progress. “It is a work in progress and is very much under the process of fine tuning,” Cruz said. “As we refine the master plan’s first version, we hope to finish it in October in time for the operational plan,” Cruz reported.

The strategic goals of the master plan project have been based on an integrative and holistic approach that is ecosystem-, science- and participatory-based. With its strategic goals, the project aims: to promote inclusive growth; to improve informal settlers conditions; to engage in disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation; to improve the water quality system; and, to protect the ecosystem in Manila Bay.

Giving an overview of the UP tri-campus efforts on the Manila Bay rehabilitation, Director Laura T. David of the UP Diliman Marine Science Institute stressed the importance of data-sharing. “We aim to achieve in surfacing the science behind the rehabilitation process as palpable as possible.” David also emphasized that ultimately, these scientific studies must be understood by the general public, as she enumerated four common stages through which they may be able to evaluate Manila Bay’s rehabilitation progress, such as “see”, “smell” “swim”, and “eat”."

The rematch between the Fighting Maroons and the Red Warriors was a maintained intense game as much as in the previous round, at the Mall of Asia arena on October 12 for UAAP Season 82’s round 2. The UE squad was a hard team to beat. However, the UP Men’s Basketball Team returned to the court with consistent offensive play and better defense. It was a redemption game for the Fighting Maroons, as well as a return of the momentum especially to Jun Manzo and Ricci Rivero, as they overcame the Red Warriors in a 3-point lead victory coming from a two-time loss.

Solid offense and sure fire three- and two-pointers by Jun Manzo, Kobe Paras and Bright Akhuetie respectively defined the first quarter of the game. Leading the team in the first run of the game were Manzo, Akhuetie, Paras, Jaydee Tungcab, and Jaybie Mantilla. The smart ball passes and tight play coordination resulted in UP’s biggest lead of the game, and ruled the early part of the match with 27 points against 10.

The second quarter was manned by brothers Javi and Juan Gomez de Liaño, Noah Webb, Ricci Rivero, and Jerson Prado. Establishing the first score of the quarter, Rivero delivered his 3-point shot at the line. However, the Red Warriors stepped up with Rey Suerte’s consistent shots that inched the team’s way to a tie with the Fighting Maroons at 41 points in the last minute of the quarter. Reclaiming the leg were Manzo’s signature shot—a teardrop that made a 3-point difference for UP leading the game in the last two seconds, ending the quarter in favor of the Fighting Maroons, 46 against 41.

In the third quarter, the Fighting Maroons maintained their tough offense with Manzo, Ju. Gomez de Liaño, Paras, Akhuetie, and Tungcab at work, concluding the quarter with a 15-point lead by UP, 65 points against UE’s 50 points.

It was another edge-of-the-seat moment in the last minute of the game. As the Red Warriors inched their way close to the lead score, they picked-up the play ultimately at 3:12 minutes left on the clock with only a two-point deficit, 67-69. But the quarter was saved by Paras’ 3-point shot at 2:18 minutes making a 72-67 lead. And Paras’ play by his strong ball pass to Javi for two made a 74-67 lead with 1:51 left on the clock. Also, Akhuetie’s 2-point shot, a saved opportunity from Rivero’s failed attempt, brought the lead to 76-69 with 1:10 minutes remaining."
"UP leads public service conference, underscores academe-community partnership – University of the Philippines",https://up.edu.ph/up-leads-public-service-conference-underscores-academe-community-partnership/,"


The UP Padayon Public Service Office organized its 3rd Colleges and Universities Public Service Conference (CUPSCON 3) which opened on October 16 at the UP Visayas auditorium in Iloilo City. The three-day conference took up the theme, “Public service through academe-community partnership: Addressing challenges on health, environment, gender, culture & education, and other key issues”.

Director Jeanette L. Yasol-Naval of UP Padayon revealed that new to the conference is the opportunity given to NGOs, LGUs, and civic society organizations to participate in the conference and encourage collaboration in addressing public service issues.

Dr. Ernesto Pernia, former Lead Economist at the Asian Development Bank and now Socio-economic Planning Secretary of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), was the keynote speaker. He discussed advancing public service through academe-community partnership. “We want the academe to be part of our journey in delivering relevant, strategic and sustainable public service. We should treat communities as partners in research and development activities so that they can contribute to translating indigenous knowledge into appropriate policies and effective actions on the ground. The promotion of structure partnerships between higher education institutions (HEIs) and stakeholders in the communities, business, and industry is also emphasized in the Philippine Development Plan with the integration of formal research and innovation efforts with informal grassroots knowledge and innovation,” Pernia emphasized.

Bakunahan sa UPD at UPLB – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/bakunahan-sa-upd-at-uplb/,"


The University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman, in partnership with the Quezon City Local Government Unit, opened a vaccination hub at the UP College of Human Kinetics gymnasium, dubbed the “Bakunahan sa UP Diliman”. When the vaccination hub called for volunteers to act as medical and non-medical frontliners, members of the UP community responded to the call.

The hub’s initial operations ran for a week, starting on April 26 when it held a simulation run and vaccination for its medical and non-medical frontliner volunteers, and continued from April 28 to May 5, 2021.

The first batch of vaccines rolled out to the UP Diliman vaccination hub catered to 817 vaccines. Following the Department of Health’s (DOH) COVID-19 Vaccination Prioritization Framework, individuals who were given priority for the vaccines and received the jab were in the A1 to A3 categories: senior citizens; persons with comorbidities; and, non-medical frontliners and UP employees who physically report to work for essential services, such as maintenance personnel and security guards.

The 4-step process

Dr. Alfred Tengonciang, one of the overall supervisors of the Quezon City-UP College of Human Kinetics Vaccination Hub (QC-UP CHK), explained that there is a DOH Interim Omnibus for the deployment of the vaccine. He added that for the QC-UP CHK vaccination site, the system in place is quite different.

As registration is the first step in the whole vaccination process, the hub expanded the registration station to prevent people from bundling up as they fall in line. The registration station consists of: the help desk; the orientation that is part counseling, part health education, and part assistance offered to vaccinees in filling in the forms; and, the data encoding.

The second step in the process takes place in the screening station where the vaccinees have their vital signs checked by volunteer medical frontliners, after which they are then cleared to be vaccinated by volunteer doctors.. The vaccination station comes after screening, wherein vaccinees receive the first dose of the Sinovac vaccine. In the last step, vaccinees undergo post-vaccination observation in the monitoring station.

“If people are moving in all of the stations, they will feel and see that the system is making progress at the different stations. The design of the vaccination system makes the flow at the hub smoother and easier,” Dr. Tengonciang said, adding that with a smoothly working system in place, the vaccination team is looking at increasing the capacity of its operations in the succeeding days.

UP community effort

The volunteers who man and maintain the QC-UP CHK vaccination hub include administrative staff, REPS, and faculty from the UP System, UP Diliman, and UP Manila.

Dr. Maria Dulce Natividad, Chairperson of the Special Committee of the UPD COVID-19 Task Force, explained that in early 2021, UPD Chancellor Fidel Nemenzo was already engaged in talks with Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte regarding the procurement of vaccines for the UP community.

The QC-UP CHK vaccination hub is a huge undertaking, especially considering that the Task Force had only two weeks to prepare and set up the vaccination site. Setting up the hub was made easier through the vaccine surveys initially sent out to the potential vaccinees, and through the voluntary effort of the UP community to make sure that a safe and efficient operation was put into place.

“UP has a mandate to render public service. Given the resources made available for UP, we urgently need to respond by providing accessible vaccination to all. We really wanted the initiative to be a community effort so that people can participate in it, and not only UP for UP. What we want is to get everybody on board and be part of this initiative. We are working together to help take care of public health,” Natividad said.

Socialized Tuition System – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/socialized-tuition-system/#,"In the University of the Philippines (UP), all students receive financial support from the National Government since the full tuition is much lower than the cost of education in the University. Given that students in UP come from all walks of life, there are those who may not be able to afford paying the full tuition. So UP created the Socialized Tuition System (STS) which provides tuition discount at rates that are based on the assessment of the paying capacity of the household to which a student belongs. This assessment looks at the income as well as the socio-economic characteristics of the household.
The current STS was approved by the UP Board of Regents on 13 December 2013.

UP signs MOU creating Mindanao Genomics Consortium – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/up-signs-mou-creating-mindanao-genomics-consortium/,"


The University, through UP Mindanao (UPMin) and the Philippine Genome Center-Mindanao Satellite Facility, has partnered with 41 institutions to establish the Mindanao Genomics Consortium (MG Consortium). A ceremonial signing of the memorandum of understanding was held on October 28 at the UPMin College of Science and Mathematics.

MG Consortium consists of academic institutions, government agencies, civil society organizations, and industry representatives who recognize the importance of omics research and its pursuit. This includes the need for both a multi-omics facility to accommodate emerging omics research and capacity building programs to strengthen the scientific workforce of Mindanao.

UP Los Baños celebrated its 112th founding anniversary on March 6, 2021 with the theme of “future-proofing” itself.

According to UPLB Chancellor Jose Camacho Jr. in his opening remarks for the foundation day convocation at Baker Hall, the theme “reflects the various activities and initiatives which we have undertaken in this time of pandemic as well as the natural calamities that have beset the country the past year: our anti-COVID-19 measures, disaster relief operations, remote learning initiatives, the webinars that helped capacitate our personnel and students, and government and institutional partnerships.”

Pointing out how UPLB “rose to the occasion” and coped with changes that would “ripple throughout society” beyond the pandemic, he said, “I know that UPLB—with compassionate hearts and determined spirits—can prepare for [future] challenges and then surpass them once they arrive.”

In his message to the UPLB constituents during the convocation, UP President Danilo Concepcion reiterated his vision of a “UP for the future”, which is a future-proof UP. He described a university which is able to keep up with changes brought about by modern technology, global trends, climate change, and crises such as global pandemics.

“We will never sacrifice the quality of UP education. . . . We will never compromise the quality of our graduates,” Concepcion emphasized.

He enumerated what UP had done in the past year which gave a glimpse of UP as “future-proof”. These included employing modes of teaching-learning, research, and public service appropriate for a time of pandemic.

Foremost among UP’s distinct public service activities during the year was leading the fight against COVID-19, specifically by the doctors, health workers, and health researchers in the UP Philippine General Hospital and the UP National Institutes of Health, which share expertise with the UP Philippine Genome Center.

“Our faculty, administrative personnel, officials, and even our students and alumni are working together in applying creative and appropriate solutions that can be part of what we shall call as ‘better new normal’,” Concepcion added, in Filipino.
He commended such initiatives in UPLB, including the opening of its laboratories for pandemic viral testing.

Honorary degree for EQJ

In the afternoon, also at Baker Hall, the University conferred upon National Scientist and UPLB alumnus Emil Javier an honorary Doctor of Laws for, in summary, “his invaluable and lifelong service and commitment to improve the livelihood of Filipino farmers and fishers”.

The University of the Philippines Manila, the nation’s Health Sciences Center, held its 109th Commencement Exercises at the Philippine International Convention Center on June 22, 2018. A total of 1,095 members of UP Manila Class of 2018 were conferred their titles and degrees.

With the theme, “Iskolar ng Bayan Manindigan para sa KKK: Katotohanan, Katarungan, at Karapatan”, Supreme Court Associate Justice Marvic M.V.F. Leonen delivered the commencement address at UP Manila’s graduation rites this year.

In his message, Leonen urged the audience to ”. . . find the patience to read, to think, to share, to organize and then to act. . .” as he explained that genuine democracies were founded on truth, “real conversations”, social justice, “collective consciousness, and collective action”. “Do not be silent in the face of injustice,” he advised the graduates.

“As you leave the great gates of this University, may you also be haunted by these words, and I share them with you: Kung hindi tayo kikilos, sino ang kikilos? Kung hindi ngayon, kailan pa? Iskolar ng Bayan, paglingkuran ang sambayanan!” concluded Leonen.

Martin M. Mamangon, graduating with a BS Public Health, spoke on behalf of the graduating class after the ceremonial distribution of diplomas, awarding of honor graduates, and hooding of doctoral candidates.

After the induction of graduates into the UP Alumni Association and the UP Manila Alumni Association, members of the graduating class held a lightning protest in front of the stage to denounce “tyrannical and anti-people” policies of the Duterte administration, such as the TRAIN law, martial law in Mindanao, extrajudicial killings, and rising impunity, among others.

UP Manila has nine degree granting units, namely: College of Allied Medical Professions (CAMP), College of Arts and Sciences (CAS), College of Dentistry (CD), College of Medicine (CM), College of Nursing (CN), College of Pharmacy (CP), College of Public Health (CPH), National Teacher Training Center for the Health Professions (NTTC-HP), and the School of Health Sciences (SHS).

Towards a more gender-sensitive community – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/towards-a-more-gender-sensitive-community/,"Towards a more gender-sensitive community
May 10, 2017 | Written by KIM G Quilinguing



At its 1324th meeting on January 26, 2017, the Board of Regents of the University of the Philippines approved the UP Anti-Sexual Harassment Code, finally adopting into policy a proposal by gender advocates in the University which had been in the works for almost a decade.

The passage of the Code, which had been spearheaded by the UP Center for Women’s and Gender Studies, was necessary, despite the University having adopted an earlier anti-sexual harassment policy which served as the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Anti-Sexual Harassment Law.

More responsive to the needs of the community

Prof. Odine de Guzman, PhD. Photo by KIM G. Quilinguing, UP MPRO.

According to UP CWGS Director Odine de Guzman, efforts to amend the University’s 1998 Implementing Rules and Regulations to the 1995 Anti-Sexual Harassment Law or Republic Act 7877 can be traced back to 2002. This was after gender advocates realized the rapidly changing gender situation in the University and the need for a more responsive policy.

Also, the Civil Service Commission had issued Resolution No. 01-0940 providing for Administrative Disciplinary Rules on Sexual Harassment Cases. Approved in May 21, 2001, the resolution defined sexual harassment as an administrative offense and prescribed a “standard procedure . . .  for the administrative investigation, prosecution and resolution of sexual harassment cases in the public sector.”

If Republic Act 7877 defined sexual harassment as a crime in work places and other venues for training or instruction, such as schools, the Civil Service Resolution prescribed the manner by which the law may be applied to government institutions, such as UP. In consideration of these developments, gender advocates in the University proposed that revisions to the 1998 IRR be made. And as early as 2005, a draft of the revised policy was presented.

Considering the size of the University community, and the need to conduct sufficient consultation with its stakeholders, it was not until 2010 that a draft with the proposed revisions to the 1998 IRR was presented to the University’s highest policy-making body, the BOR. While the proposals were well received, the proposed revised IRR would be shelved until 2014.

On September 17, 2014, President Alfredo E. Pascual signed Memorandum PAEP No. 2014-54-A which endorsed the then Center for Women’s Studies’ sponsorship of “a UP System-wide conference to assess and identify effective strategies, which would promote and strengthen UP’s implementation of RA 7877.”

The Center, which was then under Director Judy M. Taguiwalo, was tasked by the President to “forward recommendations for further refining and improving our anti-sexual harassment initiatives and for strengthening our advocacy for women’s empowerment and gender equality.”

Gender advocates and experts from the University gathered in UP Baguio in March 2015 for a UP System-wide conference. Another conference followed also in UP Baguio in June 2015, where the draft of the proposed revisions was presented.

By August 2015, a draft proposal was submitted to the President. It was hoped that the proposed changes would also be presented to the BOR for consideration.

An initial review recommended several actions, including the reconciliation of the proposed amendments with a proposal from gender advocates of UP Diliman. Officials from the CWGS, the UPD Office of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, the Diliman Legal Office, and the Office for Anti-Sexual Harassment would spend several months reconciling the proposals, as well as accommodating other measures which dealt with sexual harassment.

The resulting proposal not only defined what sexual harassment was in the context of the University, but also the various relationships where it might arise, as well as the various forms it might take. It also addressed gender concerns which were ambiguous in the IRR.  This final draft received the nod not only of gender advocates in the University, but also those of legal experts from the UP Office of the Vice President for Legal Affairs and the UP Law Center.

Better appreciation of identities and modes

Director de Guzman takes great pride in the Anti-Sexual Harassment Code, as a University policy which may be the first of its kind in going beyond the traditional concept of gender and perpetration of sexual harassment."

May 10, 2017 | Written by KIM G Quilinguing



“At 22, people say that I am ‘accomplished’ and they expect that I’ll be even more accomplished as I grow. This induces a lot of pressure, and the fear of not living up to people’s expectations can cripple anyone. However, I have to remind myself that these accolades are just decoration. The real work lies in the everyday toil that no one sees. The real achievement lies in building and growing things that are quietly changing lives.”

That’s what University of the Philippines alumna Arizza Ann Sahi Nocum says when asked how she feels about being constantly recognized for her efforts to promote dialogue between Christians and Muslims through the Kristiyano-Islam or KRIS Peace Library. The daughter of a Roman Catholic father, Armand Dean Nocum, and a Muslim mother, Annora Sahi, she shares the passion of her parents in bridging the gap between two of the country’s most active religious groups.

On February 9, 2017, Arizza was chosen as one of this year’s Ten Outstanding Students of the Philippines (TOSP) and recognized in a ceremony held at the Heroes Hall of Malacañang Palace in Manila. Her efforts to promote education through books and libraries in conflict areas in Mindanao, while maintaining her academic standing in UP Diliman, were cited as reasons for the award.

The engineer turns advocate

Prior to the TOSP award, Arizza’s efforts had been recognized with the Zonta International Young Women in Public Affairs Award in 2011, when she was still a freshman at the University. In 2016 she was also chosen as a Young Leader of the Extremely Together initiative of the Kofi Annan Foundation and One Young World.

“It takes 10 to 14 years to develop a vaccine,” says Dr. Nina Gloriani of the University of the Philippines Manila College of Public Health. And that’s not counting the intervening periods where one attends to other professional and personal activities which also require time and attention. Recently however, she and her team have registered the proof of concept for LeptoVax, the first locally produced vaccine against the Leptospirosis bacteria.

With assistance from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and Japan Science and Technology Agency, and in collaboration with scientists from Kyushu University and the Chiba Institute of Science, Dr. Gloriani and her team developed LeptoVax in 2010. It is expected to be used on house pets and livestock to protect them from the Leptospira bacteria which is being transmitted by rats.

Aside from the team’s foreign partners, the project was also supported by the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), particularly the Philippine Council for Health Development.

Over the years, the research team studied the various factors affecting the transmission of Leptospirosis in Metro Manila, using a Geographic Information System (GIS). They also developed diagnostic kits and conducted advocacy campaigns for information and health promotion against Leptospirosis. These came on top of the vaccine which they hope to develop further for human use.

It was Thursday and just a little past six in the evening. Two professors were busily finalizing the flow of their program in DZUP’s radio booth. With teasers playing on air, Jay Yacat and Summer Parcon agreed on what questions and issues they would discuss with their guest.

A ringing school bell sound effect plays and then the technician gives his signal to the hosts. Going live on 3… 2… 1 and “Good evening everyone, ako po si Jay. At ako po si Summer. At ito ang Psych o’Clock Habit.”

Now on its eighth year, Psych o’Clock Habit, or PoCH, is a regular radio program on the University of the Philippines Diliman’s campus radio station DZUP 1602 on the AM band. Originally conceived in 2009 by former Department of Psychology Professor Cherrie Joy Billedo, it was the result of an observation that there is a proliferation of programs on mainstream radio stations which offer advice by phone to questions from listeners.

According to Assistant Professor Jay Yacat, Billedo saw how popular the radio programs were and felt that the Department of Psychology could come up with a radio show which will capitalize on the expertise of its faculty members in discussing psychological issues and at the same time promote psychology as a program to its listeners. With Assistant Professor Ton Clemente, Billedo would host the show. “The goal was to make psychology more accessible,” Yacat says.

While the program was not originally conceived to tackle mental health issues in the university, Assistant Professor Apryl Mae Parcon, better known as Summer, says it is inevitable that PoCH take on topics and concerns which deal with the psychological welfare of its listeners, particularly those emotional challenges that confront students of the university.

Yacat and Parcon now regularly anchor the radio program on Thursday evenings. Aside from being on the booth on DZUP, they also maintain PoCH’s social media accounts on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. And they also maintain a blog, where former host and fellow Psychology Department faculty member, Ton Clemente, helps write the entries. Previous episodes of the program are also hosted on the DZUP website, as well as on IskWiki or the university’s interactive online learning platform.

Without their own production assistants, researchers, and writers, the show’s hosts take on a more direct role in the program, preparing the music playlists that accompany their discussion themselves. They also run the program as a free-flowing discussion, which Yacat says could be its greatest strength, since they are not constrained by a fixed flow for their conversations with their guests, thus making their episodes more natural and interesting. “I feel that this is how the program distinguishes itself, by being spontaneous,” he adds.

For Developmental Psychologist Parcon, the spontaneous flow of the program could be the reason why their audience follows every episode. “It’s good that you can discuss certain concepts in a very conversational way,” she says. “The listeners feel like they’re just eavesdropping on a conversation, but at the same time, they’re also learning certain things,” she adds.

With its tagline Usapang Malaman, Hindi Puro Chika Lang, PoCH has held discussions on air which dealt with love, courtship and relationships; academics and sports; body image; cultural identity; gender; supernatural beliefs; sleep; and even habits. The radio show has also tackled much-talked about issues such as the concerns of indigenous communities, elections, and social media.

“One of our strongest advocacies is Sikolohiyang Pilipino. For every episode, as much as possible, we try to contextualize things in our culture,” says Yacat.

Social Psychologist Yacat attributes their ability to tackle different issues aside from those which are covered by their expertise to the willingness of faculty members from other departments in UP Diliman and other UP campuses to participate in their program. “We also use the program to showcase local talents, faculty research, students, and their talents,” he says with a chuckle."

Jazz was bawal talaga. Bawal. It was forbidden.” This is what UP College of Music Associate Professor Raymundo Maigue most remembers of the time he entered the university as a freshman in 1974. Jazz being taboo in the college, he and his friends had to express their passion for the musical genre in secret. “When the professors heard us, they would tell us to stop. We couldn’t do anything but hide.”

While there was no formal course then, Maigue remembers one professor at the college who taught a non-credit jazz improvisation course, which heightened their fascination for the genre and their growing need to understand it more. But jazz was still not considered part of their formal training.

Though prohibited from formally practicing their music in the college, he vividly recalls the challenges they faced then in pursuing their passion for jazz. “We used to jam wherever, in secret—at the Carillon, under the stairs. We had no instruments, we just borrowed amplifiers, trying to beat each other. It was fun then, it felt like we had all the time. Even when it got dark, we continued jamming.”

As to why he has more passion for jazz than other musical genres, Rayben, as he is known to family and friends, explains that it allows him to have a different take on the usual arrangement of songs. “You can jazz up even Tagalog songs, which of course changed because of the arrangement. We changed things around.” Jazz, he adds, enables him to have a more personal rendition of some songs.

Things turned for the better for Rayben and his fellow enthusiasts in 1977, when visiting American professor and jazz musician Joseph Howard joined the college through the Fulbright Scholar Program. Howard taught jazz theory and improvisation. “We were so happy, the books were free, the teaching was free.” The American professor shared his passion for the music with his Filipino students for eight months before returning to the US.

With Howard back in the States, the genre was again relegated by some conservative academics to being, in Maigue’s words, a nuisance in the college. But by this time, there were also some members of the College of Music who had grown to appreciate jazz. And some of them would even occasionally hire them for personal events.

Maigue says the UP Jazz Ensemble started as a small group called the Laboratory Band. “If you had a composition, we played it just to hear it, good or bad.” The band eventually became the ensemble."

Learning from chaos – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/learning-from-chaos/,"


“I love chaos. That’s why I love being Executive Vice President of UP. You can quote me on that.”

With good humor, a booming laugh, and an enthusiasm that fills up a room, Dr. Teodoro “Ted” Javier Herbosa—trauma surgeon, UP College of Medicine professor, disaster medicine and emergency medical care specialist, and former Department of Health (DOH) undersecretary—explains what just might be his main qualification for the job of UP’s first EVP in decades: “I love blood, guts and gore. My line is trauma, and I get excited in a chaotic environment. I get bored with routine. . . so I’m the ideal guy to put in an environment of chaos.”

UP, a chaotic environment? When university leaders around the world have compared managing academics to herding cats? Say it isn’t so.

“I step in, and there’s the conflict over general education already,” Ted points out with a laugh, describing the situation that greeted him upon his appointment as EVP. For him, it was all “very interesting.”

A UP EVP for the 21st century

It is also in a sense quite new. As the first EVP since the time of UP President Edgardo Angara, Herbosa has the task of dusting off the position and updating it to fit the realities of a massive university system in the 21st century.

“The EVP is the alter-ego of the President,” he explains. In a corporation, the equivalent of the EVP is the Chief Operating Officer, who sees to the day-to-day operations of the company and makes sure everything is well coordinated and running smoothly, as well as performing any other tasks designated by the President.

“We’re still in a state of flux. Because we haven’t had an EVP in a long time, I have no model to follow. All the previous EVPs came before the chancellor system,” Ted continues. Now, however, we have a system in which the chancellors of UP’s eight constituent units customarily report straight to the UP President. “It’s an interesting model. I noticed the chancellors are not used to it. Like them, I’m also looking for my sweet spot.”

He is also well aware of the challenges of running a university. “It’s a little different from my position as undersecretary,” says Herbosa, who served as DOH undersecretary from 2010 to 2015, where he achieved the DOH’s objective of implementing universal health care coverage. Although, as a government agency, the DOH is much larger than UP, the chain of command was hierarchical, with Herbosa serving as chief of staff directly under the DOH secretary. “It’s very linear. It’s like a military organization. Civil servants follow the mandate of authority.”

This is in clear contrast with an academic institution like UP, where every decision is subject to debate and every opinion has an equal and opposite opinion. However, before Herbosa became DOH undersecretary, he was already a faculty member of the UP College of Medicine and a doctor at the UP-PGH. His background as a UP teacher stands him in good stead. “My style of leadership is very liberal, so I think I will fit well in the academic world. I grew up in an academic environment in UP Manila, so I understand this. The opinions of different people, all looking at the same thing from a different light—it’s enriching.”

Enriching, sure, but it can also be frustrating. He laughs: “I like that. ‘Frustrating but enriching.’ Well, I’m an optimist, so that’s one thing that got me to where I am in terms of positions.” 

Twists and turns

Optimism, coupled with a willingness to take risks, to learn new things, and to get out of his comfort zone. For example, he describes himself as a baby-boomer who is also a techie, having founded the Philippine Medical Informatics Society in addition to being certified for COBIT 5 for governance and IT management during his time in the DOH, making him the highest-ranking Filipino government official with that certification. But the path that Herbosa’s life took, which eventually led him to the position of UP EVP, also featured some surprise twists and turns.

“I didn’t plan to be EVP of the University,” he confesses. “I just wanted to be a good teacher. And now I’m here.”

As a matter of fact, neither did he plan on becoming DOH undersecretary.

“You know what I planned? I wanted to be Director of the PGH. I didn’t get it, but I did become DOH undersecretary, the director of many hospitals. Then I said, I want to run for UP Manila Chancellor. But because of politics, I decided, never mind, I’m done with this leadership role. Then here comes the UP President asking me to be his EVP.” He adds, laughing, “Funny how life goes.” Few people know that Ted and his lawyer sister Tess, the Securities and Exchange Commission chair, are descended from Jose Rizal’s elder sister Lucia, who married an Herbosa.

Life’s plot twists actually began during his childhood. For one thing, he didn’t start out wanting to be a doctor. “I wanted to be in Fine Arts, because I drew a lot and very well.” As a medical student tasked with drawing the organ specimens they were studying, his classmates used to laugh at him for putting such an inordinate amount of effort into sketching and shading his drawings. “Eventually, my mother killed that, because she said I would only end up starving. I sometimes say, if only my mother were still alive, she’d know how much I pay for paintings now.” Ted and his wife, Grace, channel their love of art now into collecting choice artworks and appreciating good art.

Later in high school, Ted realigned his life plans and entered a Benedictine monastery with every intention of becoming a monk. “I was in the abbey for, like, six months. But then my mother and oldest sister convinced me to go to college first, and if I still wanted to become a monk after that, then they said they would even pay for my education.”

So out of the monastery and into UP he went, becoming a BS Biology student in Diliman. And the boy who had heretofore attended an exclusive boys’ school discovered something that pretty much nixed his plans to become a monk: the opposite sex. “I had a girlfriend by second year college,” he says with a laugh.

He entered UP in 1975, at the height of student activism. “UP was like an independent island, like an oasis of free thought and free thinking. I joined rallies, of course, because everybody was joining rallies. You joined the boycott because when there was a call for a boycott, no one went to class. Even the professor didn’t go to class.”

He was in his second year in residency in surgery when the first EDSA revolution broke out in 1986. “We were one of the first to go to EDSA. We brought an ambulance with a team. We were scared it would get worse, so we wanted to be ready to provide healthcare. We witnessed history change.”

From trauma surgery to emergency care

The days after the EDSA revolution brought a new sense of hope, a kind of energy he channeled into being part of the administration and helping develop the country. During Dr. Alfredo Ramirez’ term as chancellor of UP Manila, the PGH Trauma Unit was created, and Herbosa joined the team. Chancellor Ramirez sent him to take an international postgraduate sourse in Surgery in 1991 at Tel Aviv University, on a scholarship offered by the Israeli government."

(This article reviews the domestic and overseas Filipino workers’ situations as of 2012. It also articulates hope through policy interventions pertaining to wage hikes and better opportunities as feasible solutions that will help the working-age population in the daily fight for survival here in the Philippines.)

The Filipino workers’ hopes for a better future take them to countries where they think they may improve their economic status. Their flight is most of all a fight for survival.

The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) reported a total of 2.8 million unemployed Filipinos in 2011 while the April 2012 Labor Force Survey (LFS) of the National Statistics Office (NSO) estimated that some 7.3 million Filipinos are underemployed out of the 40.6 million it considers part of the labor force.

The same NSO survey showed that the majority of employed and underemployed Filipinos are in the services sector (51.4 percent of employed, 40.2 percent of underemployed) and the agriculture sector (33 percent of employed, 43 percent of underemployed).

UPDATE: The Philippine Statistics Authority’s (PSA) October 2018 LFS indicated that there were 2.2 million unemployed and 5.5 million underemployed, out of the 71.9 million Filipinos who are 15 years old and over. Filipinos in the services sector comprised 56.8 percent, the agriculture sector showed 24.1 percent, while the industry sector registered only 19.1 percent of the total employed. 

“Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) are not considered part of the labor force in the Philippines.”

IBON Foundation Inc. estimated that 4.64 million Filipinos were unemployed in 2017 and “inflation has increased the family living wage (FLW) needed for meeting basic needs to Php1,175 for a family of six in the National Capital Region (NCR) as of June 2018.”

The country’s more than 300,000 registered nurses remain either unemployed or “mis-employed,” although Philippine government hospitals need a whopping 300-percent increase in the number of nurses to meet the ideal 1:10 nurse to patient ratio.

UPDATE: Nurse-patient ratio in hospitals ranges from 1:50 up to 1:80 as of February 2018, according to #LabanNurses Movement.

These numbers point to what Migrante International (MI) calls the “primary push factor” for workers to seek jobs abroad.

“Underdevelopment—aggravated by the perennial lack of livelihood, income and opportunities—forces Filipinos to migrate, separating them from their loved ones while working in another country.”

According to the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA), a total of 1,470,826 Filipino workers were deployed overseas in 2010.  The data do not include undocumented OFWs whom MI estimates to be as many as 900,000 as of 2007.

UPDATE: The POEA reported that 1,992,746 workers were deployed as OFWs while MI claimed that there were almost 1 million undocumented OFWs in the US alone for the year 2017.

MI also says that there are 12 million to 15 million Filipinos overseas, and that 30 percent to 40 percent of the entire Philippine population depends on remittances from their relatives abroad.

Among those interviewed for this story were former employees of the University of the Philippines Manila. One of them served the public sector for four years before flying to Dubai to allow her to meet her family’s growing needs. “Salary was just enough for the most basic commodities; we could hardly make both ends meet,” she said, adding that her take-home pay was only good for paying off their bills and debts. That is why she decided to work abroad.

Outside the Philippines, she said, “There are many companies that offer better salaries and benefits.  Even skilled workers are empowered and can attain a better life.”

Aside from economic reasons, she decided to leave the Philippines because she no longer sees it as a safe country.

“The Myth of Migration for Development” report by IBON and MI states that “the income benefits from remittances for households are arguably considerably offset by the social harm for families due to separation for long periods of time.”"

Uplifting Lives through Interior Design – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/uplifting-lives-through-interior-design-3/,"Uplifting Lives through Interior Design
May 28, 2019 | Written by Jo. Florendo B. Lontoc



BS Interior Design Batch 2019 realizes their theme “Hilom: Rebuilding Spaces, Rebuilding Lives” in healing spaces for the shelter of End Child Prostitution, Child Pornography and the Trafficking of Children for Sexual Purposes (ECPAT) Philippines, filling interiors with images of Philippine flora and colors associated with hope, healing, and wellness, as typified by the re-designed living room shown in the first photo. The second one shows the room before rehabilitation.

 

Which school should lead in integrating public service in its undergraduate courses but the public service university itself, UP? UP’s Interior Design program is a trailblazer. Since more than 15 years ago, it has left the studio for its application course in order to embrace public service, an initiative that has given its students an edge over others.

The decision to take this untrodden path followed an era of soul-searching in the University, where a study in the early 1990s revealed that students ranked social orientation and moral uprightness far down in the order of importance of the qualities their colleges were developing in them. Reaching out to the community became a buzz-word, with UP Vice President for Public Affairs Ledivina Cariño promoting service learning as “learning to serve, and serving to learn.”

A basic need

The College of Home Economics led by Dean Cecilia Florencio was one of the first to respond by serving the poor of nearby Libis. The Interior Design program saw an opportunity to turn the impression of Interior Design as elitist on its head. From the beginning, it was the wrong impression, Interior Design professor Adelaida Mayo says. She places Interior Design as a basic need.

“There’s food, clothing, and shelter. Architecture deals with shelter, but where is its soul? It’s in the space people use. It’s inside. The shelter will just be the shell of it,” Mayo says.

She raises the question of livability: the lack of finances precludes enjoying the benefits of proper interior design. “In low-cost housing, for example, there is really no Interior Design team to do it. And that has led to problems and accidents.”

The advocacy for democratizing Interior Design must start with students. They must have the opportunity to directly touch people’s lives through the discipline they have been studying in the past three years, and to understand the enormous public service potential of their field.

Going into direct public service was a practical alternative for an application course, which aims to “apply the knowledge, skills and competencies acquired and developed during the first three years of extensive training in interior design through a special project of their choice.”

Beyond the studio

For a long time, students of Interior Design were applying their skills only in the studio. This is understandable as designing actual interiors and implementing them requires a license, which students could not possibly have before graduation. They were compelled to simulate interior space, staging mock-ups of walls and ceilings and floors, furnishing, decorating and then exhibiting them inside halls, which was an expensive affair. But the resources went to waste in the inevitable dismantling for the egress. The students had no idea how their designs would have held up in actual use.

Mayo and Raquel Florendo, who were handling the two classes of ID 179 Special Projects Class, broached the idea of merging their classes to serve financially challenged institutions whose spaces were in dire need of rehabilitation. The students would be under the close supervision of the professors, whose licenses would take care of the legal requirements for the projects.

The students discussed the proposal among themselves and accepted the new challenge of the class. Grouped into teams, they helped look for project sites. They consulted with, and proposed designs for screening by, their professors. They coordinated among themselves to unify their concepts. Making cost estimates, they then set out to raise funds and get sponsorships.

In academic year 2001-2002, ID 179 Special Projects rolled out in eight cottages of the Department of Social Welfare and Development’s Reception and Study Center for Children; the clinic and therapy rooms of the Golden Acres Home for the Aged; and a model unit for Gawad Kalinga. At the end of the first semester, what had been dark, dreary, and beat-up spaces had turned into bright and proper spaces to welcome back children recovering from trauma, the aged regaining strength and positive outlooks, and the poorest of the poor reclaiming their dignity.

The bar was set for future batches. Since then, students have worked on important sections of public hospitals and clinics; schools and dormitories; halfway houses and shelters for women, children, the recovering sick and the disabled; dance studios for the talented poor; libraries; and Gawad Kalinga housing."

The University Athletics Association of the Philippines (UAAP) is a collegiate league giant. And in UP, athletes who compete here get the most attention and support.

UP doesn’t lack non-UAAP athletes who bring honor and glory to the University and the country. But they are hardly recognized, perennially falling under the UAAP’s shadow. A look at some of them reveals athleticism that is no less excellent and exciting.

Climbing the highest mountain

Alumna Noelle Wenceslao was literally on top of the world. On May 16, 2007, she was the first Southeast Asian woman to reach the summit of Mt. Everest. Minutes later, she was joined by fellow alumna Janet Belarmino and teammate Carina Dayondon. They were part of the First Philippine Mt. Everest Expedition.

Not only were they the first Southeast Asian women to reach the world’s highest peak. They were also the first women to traverse it—ascending on the north side (Tibet) and descending on the south side (Nepal).

Looking at this petite, energetic, and unassuming woman, one wouldn’t think she had climbed the highest mountain in the world. Noelle doesn’t want to say “conquered.”

“To conquer it makes it sound adversarial. Nature isn’t something you’d want to go against. You’re at its mercy.” Noelle should know. She suffered from pulmonary edema due to the cold, thin air during the expedition.

“Climbing Mt. Everest wasn’t just a personal accomplishment. We represented the Philippines and showed our nation can overcome the impossible and face the most difficult hurdles life throws our way.”

In the last Southeast Asian Games, she bagged the individual women’s gold in the compound bow event and helped her team win a collective gold in the same category. As the youngest member of the Philippine Team, this is certainly impressive. In 2005, she swept all the individual events in the compound bow category at the Asian Grand Prix."

Lack of familiarity with the historical basis and continuing evolution of our national boundaries is the source of government’s (and the general population’s) seeming lack of agreement and consistency in the conception of the national territory and how the Nation-State should respond to external challenges to its integrity and stability.

Philippine national territory was legally described by the 1935 Constitution as being comprised of all territories ceded to the US by Spain in the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and the Treaty of Washington of 1900, as well as territories under the 1930 Convention between the US and the United Kingdom.

The territorial lines drawn by the first and third agreements, combined and appearing as an irregular “box,” have comprised a technical description of our territorial boundaries. But such description creates anomalies, because the Treaty of Paris left some features (e.g., the Batanes Islands, the Turtle Islands, one-half of Sibutu Island, Scarborough Shoal) outside the box, while the Treaty of Washington states that such islands also deemed to have been subject to the cession are part of Philippine territory."

As the country’s premier secular institution of higher learning, UP takes pride in being a haven of liberalism, open-mindedness and independent thinking. But the university is hardly free from the discrimination, ostracism, harassment and violence inflicted upon LGBTQs. Nevertheless, where else but in UP can we begin to create a safe place where LGBTQ rights and identities are not only recognized and tolerated but actively affirmed, included and promoted as well?

Three contexts for LGBTQs

“In the LGBTQ literature, we make a distinction among three kinds of contexts,” says UP Diliman Department of Psychology Prof. Eric Manalastas. “On one hand, we have contexts that are hostile to LGBTQs, such as in places where you have policies against cross-dressing or same-sex relationships, or where there is a certain amount of jeopardy in being ‘outed’ as an LGBTQ in the institution. On the other end of the spectrum, you have the LGBTQ-affirmative context” such as an institution with “an explicit inclusion policy, a policy that says we do not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, among others.”

Somewhere between the two extremes is a middle ground marked more by a mild or negligent tolerance of LGBTQs. LGBTQs are not exactly marginalized, but are not fully integrated into the mainstream either. LGBTQ rights and issues are regarded as esoteric, frivolous or even as the latest in-thing, and discussions of these never go beyond the superficial.

Hence, Manalastas regards the issue in terms of bringing the LGBTQs into the center “of creating those spaces that are LGBTQ-specific, and then the spaces that integrate LGBTQs issues into the mainstream”—of transforming the environments for LGBTQs, including UP, from hostile or neutral to affirmative."

“I expect the Filipino scientist to contribute towards establishing a scientific culture in the Philippines,” Dr. Caesar A. Saloma, director of the National Institute of Physics (NIP), said when he received the first Concepcion Dadufalza Award for Distinguished Achievement in 2001.

Indeed, Saloma wasn’t and isn’t alone in this expectation. In science teaching and scientific research, he’s joined by hundreds of colleagues in UP, long the acknowledged leader in this field of endeavor in the Philippines. But in this new millennium, what is the state of science in UP, and how does UP stand in science against the rest of the best in the region?

High marks

UP clearly leads in science education and research in the country. Science majors from UP consistently win awards for outstanding performance in their research efforts. Just as significant as these awards are the publications posted by University scientists, teachers, and students in internationally refereed scientific journals.

Aside from these, several units of the University have become national centers of excellence by virtue of presidential proclamations. These include the National Institute of Geological Sciences, the Marine Science Institute (MSI), the Natural Sciences Research Institute (NSRI), the NIP, the National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (BIOTECH), and the National Institutes of Health. Other departments across the UP System have also been declared centers of excellence and development by the Commission on Higher Education.

Technology and talent

The quality of research done in UP relies on the communion of technology and talent. UP has striven to match the brainpower it has to generate outstanding scientific outputs with the facilities to accomplish them. The University prides itself in being the only university with a DNA Analysis Laboratory (DAL) as well as being the only institution in the country with a Femtosecond Laser Facility and a High-Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT) receiving station.

Triumph over tragedy

The DAL’s mettle as the Philippines’ own “CSI” was put to the test in a heartrending tragedy a few years ago. In December 1998, a fire gutted the orphanage run by the Asocacion de Damas de Filipinas, a social welfare institution in Paco, Manila. The fire killed 25 children and five adults, whose remains were charred beyond recognition. Three months after burial, the bodies were exhumed, and the DAL used painstaking DNA analysis to identify the victims; eventually, 18 bodies were given names.

Lasers and oceans

In the field of physics, UP’s NIP boasts of its P18-million femtosecond laser—one of a handful around the region. Lasers have played a major part in research and NIP, in fact, owns several types. Its latest acquisition, however, is a huge step forward in the study of physics because it emits high peak powers of light energy in short intervals—one-quadrillionth of a second, too fast for the naked eye.

In marine science, UP is proud of the MSI’s HRPT. The remote sensing facility receives pictures taken by satellites at least twice a day. The images are processed by determining the amount of chlorophyll detected in the water. This is important because areas with the most chlorophyll are those with the most plankton. And where plankton is abundant, fish are plenty. The resulting images pinpoint potential fishing grounds for Filipino fishing fleets.

High-value products

In UP Los Baños (UPLB), BIOTECH has done some impressive studies of its own. The Environmental Biotechnology Program undertakes activities like evaluating the potentials and environmental impact of distillery waters, effective waste management, utilization and recycling of waste materials as fertilizers, and the deodorization of livestock waste.

The UPLB College of Veterinary Medicine has a Virology Laboratory that studies in-depth molecular biology in the areas of animal vaccine, animal biotechnology, and animal disease diagnosis. Also being undertaken is research on Multiple Ovulation-Embryo Transfer to hasten the genetic improvement of livestock, promote the conservation of animals with superior or unique genetic traits, and provide an alternative to the importation of cattle.

UP Visayas leads in the study of fisheries and aquaculture so it’s no wonder that many of UPV’s research efforts have been recognized here and abroad. UP Manila, meanwhile, leads in the medical sciences and public health. It is looking forward to the completion of the Sentro Oftalmologico Jose Rizal this year, among its many projects. It will serve as a specialized facility for ophthalmology and will become the field’s research center in the University.

In UP Diliman, the Lakbayan participants call to end attacks in Lumad schools, to lift Martial Law in Marawi, and to stop the imperialist plunder of Moro territories, among others. Photo by Pau Villanueva, taken from her September 7, 2017 article for CNN Philippines Life, “Following the Lumad, from Bukidnon to Manila.” Check out her other works at www.pauvillanueva.com.

 

Background

Mindanao is home to diverse communities, with 13 ethno-linguistic groups and around 30 Lumad groups. Of its total population of 25.73 million, some 18 percent are Muslims and approximately 5 percent are Lumad; the rest are migrants and their descendants. Females comprise half of the population. Hence, by sheer number, women are a vital resource for Mindanao’s development.

However, according to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the Gender-related Development Index (GDI), “which measures the inequality in the achievement of women and men based on life expectancy at birth, educational attainment and standard of living,” are also low in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). Sulu had the lowest GDI in the entire country at 0.322. According to a report: “Mindanao women need urgent attention in the areas of economic opportunities, reproductive health, political participation, education, and even basic services such as water and power.” Poverty, it said, “is deepest and most severe in the provinces where the indigenous peoples and Muslims reside.”

In December 2009, I visited Mintal gym, where more than a thousand Lumad families camped while they begged for pinaskuhan in downtown Davao. The Mintal gym is just one of the places provided by the city government to accommodate the so-called “exodus of Lumad” every Christmas season. There were piles of sacks containing clothes and crockery. The people slept inside the gym and cooked in the makeshift communal kitchen located outside. There was a crowd at the children’s park where some enterprising Lumad put up stalls that sold packets of coffee, sugar, oil, salt, and soy sauce. Candies, biscuits, hotdogs, and barbecued chicken necks and feet were for sale.

Beloved writer and professor Butch Dalisay retires after 35 years of service – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/beloved-writer-and-professor-butch-dalisay-retires-after-35-years-of-service/,"


“Keep the liberal spirit alive, maintain harmony between all branches of our University administration, and take care of the UP Institute of Creative Writing (ICW).”

These were Dr. Jose “Butch” Yap Dalisay Jr.’s requests as he retired from the University on January 15 after 35 years of service. He was a Literature and Creative Writing professor and former chairperson at the UP Diliman Department of English and Comparative Literature and Vice President for Public Affairs.

 

“UP is unique and in some ways immutable. The University is bigger than any one or even all of us. It has a life and an integrity of its own. We need to keep fighting for a UP truly worthy of its founders’ dreams—a UP governed by merit rather than by patronage, and led by men and women of impeccable intelligence, ability, and most of all, integrity.” -Dr. Jose “Butch” Y. Dalisay Jr. (Photo by Misael Bacani, UP MPRO)

 

The UP System administration led by President Danilo Concepcion hosted a retirement dinner in Dalisay’s honor at the Executive House on his last day in UP, where he was celebrated by family, friends, and colleagues.

Dalisay spent 45 years in government service, having worked at the National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) for ten years prior to UP. “I started as a writer at age 19, fresh out of martial law prison and a college dropout with no more than 21 freshman units to my name,” he said. During the course of his stint at NEDA, he was readmitted to UP and became a working student. He later left the agency to finish his AB. Thus began his 35-year career in academe.

 

Dr. Gerardo Sicat (left), whom Dalisay says “took a chance on him” by hiring him at NEDA. When Sicat left NEDA, he gave Dalisay a typewriter as a parting gift and asked him to pick ten books from his personal library. He reveals with a laugh that Dalisay picked his favorites. Dr. Judy Celine Ick (right) met Dalisay in French class when he had returned to his studies in UP Diliman. The classmates became friends and later, colleagues at the DECL. “In the days before computers, when Butch used to type out his stories, I was always a recipient of a signed carbon copy.” (Photos by Misael Bacani, UP MPRO)

 

Dr. Lily Rose Tope (left), DECL chair, says Dalisay’s “deep baritone was like the voice of god” that immediately restored calm during heated discussions in department meetings when he was chair. Dr. Ma. Cynthia Rose Bautista (right), VP for Academic Affairs, reveals that Dalisay, being the techie that he is, set up a Viber group for the UP System officials. (Photos by Misael Bacani, UP MPRO)

 

In his speech at the retirement dinner, Dalisay said that apart from being trusted with administrative positions—department chair, ICW director, and Vice President twice (his first during the presidency of Dr. Francisco Nemenzo)—”the greatest honor” he received was the approval of the One UP-Jose Y. Dalisay Jr. Professorial Chair in Creative Writing., which he considers “an honor I did not have to die first or even retire first to see. That chair, under its present terms, will be good for another 30 years, and it will survive me long after I am gone.”

For his able leadership and distinguished service as the U.P. System’s Vice President for Public Affairs (OVPPA) from 1 May 2003 until 9 February 2005, and 10 February 2017 until 15 January 2019;

For his valuable and meaningful contribution as member of the President’s Advisory Council (PAC) and the U.P. System Executive Committee;

“The making, existence, and expansion of the citizenry outside of the borders and the increasing transborder political participation of the diaspora mark a transnationalization of the nation-state and citizenship,” said Dr. Chulwoo Lee, professor of Law at Yonsei University Law School, as keynote speaker of the 2nd Philippine Koreanist Congress on August 17, 2019 at Novotel, Cubao, Quezon City.

With the title: “How does diaspora engagement reshape citizenship and nation-statehood?”, Lee’s paper was about countries redefining their ambit and according rights to migrants, based on concepts of citizenship that have been shifting alongside increased global migration.

“The Philippines and Korea are in tune with the times. Incorporating diaspora members into the active citizenry is now regarded as a democratic requirement,” Lee added. Both Korea and the Philippines have provisions for overseas voting, for example, but the Philippines is more advanced in allowing postal voting, he said.

Aside from dual citizenship, concepts such as “ethnizenship” and other forms of the “noncitizen diaspora status” are creating and expanding the “transnational nation”, Lee said.

In the open forum, he further argued that “limiting dual citizenship is increasingly unsustainable”.

The Second Philippine Koreanist Congress, with the theme: “Mapping the Korean diaspora in the Philippines: 70-year history and friendship in retrospect”, was spearheaded by the UP Korea Research Center in cooperation with The Academy of Korean Studies and supported by the Korean Cultural Center and the UP Department of Linguistics.

No, she’s not a snake charmer. Nor is she some kind of snake whisperer. She is herpetologist Dr. Leticia “Letty” Afuang of UP Los Baños (UPLB). And while she specializes in all things reptilian and amphibian, she has become quite known as the “snake lady.”

Saw a cobra slithering around? Woke up to find a satisfied snake instead of your lovebirds in the cage? With one barangay even named “Maahas” (an area with many snakes), people around LB know whom to call.

 

Photos of snakes caught at the Mt. Makiling Forest Reserve from the UPLB Museum of Natural History Forest CANOPI Program Project 3 – Forest Canopy Vertebrate Fauna: clockwise from left, Ahaetulla prasina (Asian vine snake), Boiga dendrophila (Gold-ringed cat snake), and Trimeresurus flavomaculatus (Philippine pit viper)

 

“I make myself available because those are valuable teaching opportunities. There are people whose first instinct is to kill the snakes they see because they are afraid. It’s part of my duty as an educator to allay their fears by sharing knowledge,” the pastor’s wife and mother of two says.

But how did she get the moniker in the first place?

Letty attributes it to all her public lectures and speaking engagements, where the interest in herpetology mainly gravitates toward snakes. “Questions about frogs or lizards, for example, are rare. I think it’s really the fear of snakes that makes people so curious about them.” Over time, she became known as UPLB’s resident snake expert.

And despite almost dying from accidental envenomation by a viper during field work in Palawan almost 20 years ago, she continues to advocate for the non-violent handling of snakes.

 

“The venom felt hot and I could feel it crawling up my arm.”—Dr. Afuang on getting envenomated in Palawan. She wasn’t bitten, but had gotten venom through a wound in her hand, trying to free a viper that was tied up by its captors. (Photo by Misael Bacani, UP MPRO)

 

“This snake was tied up by some people and it was struggling to breathe. I wanted to relieve its pain.” Forgetting that she had a wound in her hand, she went to untie the thrashing viper. Venom got into her wound and within seconds, she felt her hand go warm.

She had to be carried down the mountain, transported in a small boat, then in a mixer that later broke down, and then in another mixer that passed by, before finally reaching the hospital. “It’s a miracle I survived with no antivenom. I woke up the next day like nothing happened.”

From animal lover to teacher-scientist

Growing up on a farm in Isabela, Letty reveals she was always fond of animals. But it was high-school Biology that turned that affinity into a deeper interest in studying them. “I loved that class so much that I was already preserving specimens of lizards, insects, and worms for study. In relation to herpetology, I became fascinated with amphibians first.”

It was only natural for her then to pursue a BS Zoology degree in UP Diliman in the mid-1970s, where her attention shifted to invertebrates. When she graduated in 1979, Letty went to teach at Central Luzon State University (CLSU), Nueva Ecija. And after just one semester, she got a scholarship to pursue a master’s degree.

She wasn’t able to enroll in Diliman because she was late and was advised to try UPLB isntead. She laughs as she recalls how she was given instructions on getting there. “I didn’t know UPLB! But when I arrived, I just fell in love with the place and the people.”

 

In the left photo, Dr. Afuang points out that sea snakes are distinguished by flat, paddle-like tails like this specimen, Laticauda semifasciata. In the other photo, she explains that a tell-tale sign a snake is venomous is the triangle-shaped head and skinny neck just like on the viper specimen she’s holding, Tropidolaemus wagleri. Both snakes are found in the Philippines. (Photos by Misael Bacani, UP MPRO)

 

She finished her MS in Zoology, major in Vertebrate Biology, in 1985. By then, she was enamored with wildlife biology and brought her CLSU students to UPLB each summer for training in that field of study. In 1991, just two years after her term as chairperson of the Department of Biological Sciences, Letty resigned from CLSU and returned to UPLB—this time to teach.

She juggled teaching, doing research, family life, and getting her PhD while also dealing with a heart ailment. And in 2003, after around four years, she finally earned her PhD in Environmental Science and Management from UPLB. This time, she specialized in protected areas planning, development, and management, with particular focus on wildlife biology and herpetology, and a minor in genetics and forestry."

A small area tucked away in the Institute of Biological Sciences of the University of the Philippines in Los Baños gives proof to the saying that good things come in little packages. The wards of the University’s Bee Program are no bigger than one’s thumb, but they are able to provide a livelihood and a whole range of products to those who are interested.

What began in 1989 as a coordinating body with only five members of the UPLB community, has now grown into a research and extension program with around 35 members from various fields of expertise. Led initially by the late Dr. Pacifico C. Payawal of the Institute of Biological Sciences, the Bee Program would eventually become an integrated, multi-disciplinary group, which would tackle everything from beekeeping, bee science and other bee-related research work.

Program Chair Jose Rene L. Micor said that the program aims to formalize and integrate all bee-related research activities of UPLB. The 35 multi-disciplinary members of the Bee Program have been continuously working as a team to become a dynamic research and extension center capable of providing a variety of technical assistance to different sectors. “We are basically providing assistance to almost everyone who needs help with regard to bee science or bee-related research,” he said.

The program provides training in beekeeping, and over the years, it has worked with various local government units, state universities and colleges, higher education institutions, non-government organizations, and even private farms interested in bee sciences. “Initially it was 1 to 2 [trainings per year], but nowadays we have it 4 [times per year] because it’s always full,” said Micor. Among those which they have partnered with are the Cavite State University and the University of Southern Mindanao. They have also worked with the Balay Buhay sa Uma in Sorsogon and the Yumi farm in Tayabas, Quezon.

Aside from the training, the program provides technical services related to beekeeping, such as: Beekeeping Management and Apiary Establishment, Honey and Pollen Analysis, Pollen Advisory and Bee Disease Diagnosis.

Meet UP’s next satellite builders
April 25, 2019 | Written by Andre DP Encarnacion




Video by KIM Quilinguing for the UP Media and Public Relations Office

 

On June 29, 2018, a peculiar little satellite was launched into space aboard a Falcon 9 rocket in Florida, USA. As far as Philippine satellites go, space enthusiasts are familiar with the balikbayan box-sized class of microsatellites like Diwata-1 and Diwata-2. But this nanosatellite, Maya-1 was even smaller.

Created by Filipino scholars Adrian Salces and Joven Javier as part of the Kyushu Institute of Technology’s (KyuTech) Birds-2 project, Maya-1 tipped the scales at barely over a kilogram, while carrying hardware that could facilitate communication in disaster scenarios. It was the first Filipino built nanosatellite and would be an inspiration for future developments in the Philippines.

A few years ago it was difficult to imagine us Filipinos having our own satellites, let alone having qualified personnel to build them. But with the success of Maya-1, as well as the Diwata microsatelllites, the UP and the Department of Science and Technology-funded STAMINA4Space program (formerly PHL-Microsat) have launched a project that will develop this future crop of satellite builders.

The name of the project is STeP-UP, and its scholars will not only be trained to build satellites like Maya-1, but–they will also be doing almost all their work inhouse.

Perfect System

At the centerpiece of the STeP-UP project (short for Space Science Proliferation through University Partnerships) is the Masters in Engineering program at UP’s Electrical and Electronics Engineering Institute (EEEI). With support from the STeP-UP program, the Institute is now offering its first two-year graduate track on nanosatellite engineering.

Eight DOST-funded scholars from different backgrounds and institutions passed the gruelling screening process to become part of the pioneering batch this 2019. Their mission–to be able to create two 10x10x10 cm. nanosatellites at the end of their study period. All the design and construction work will be done at the Institute, with Kyutech helping with space environment testing in preparation for the launch of the satellites at the International Space Station (ISS).

According to STeP-UP head, Engr. Paul Jason Co, the project is about passing on what their team has learned to partners in the academe back home. “We have to proliferate all this knowledge across the country,” he said. “If only the same sets of people are the ones working on space technology, that would be a waste.”

With the graduate program track on nanosatellite engineering, the STeP-UP project through the Institute can get to engage with other universities on the way to creating a university consortium for space technology. Members of that consortium will share in the satellite-building capacities that STAMINA4Space has pioneered; while UP and its STeP-UP partners will also develop ground stations in these universities to manage the nanosatellites they build.

Why nanosatellites or ‘cubesats’? “For one thing, cubesats are very small,” Co said. Unlike microsatellites like Diwata or their more enormous brethren, these satellites are much cheaper to build.

“And,” he continued, “since it’s a small system, it’s a perfect fit for learning about this technology. For bigger satellites, it will take years, even decades to develop one of them.” The nanosatellite, on the other hand, fits neatly within the two years allotted to the postgraduate students to produce them.

No Stranger

STeP-UP scholar Gladys Bajaro had been working on satellites even before the program was launched. In fact, this graduate of Electronics and Communications Engineering from Bicol State College of Applied Science and Technology played a key role in the success of the country’s initial forays into satellite technology.

As lead engineer of the amateur radio and satellite station at the EEEI, Bajaro applied her skills to tracking Maya-1 and helping out on Diwata-2’s amateur radio unit. Still, despite her experience, none of her previous feats truly prepared Bajaro for the holistic training required to build a satellite from scratch.

Bajaro detailed the three courses she and her classmates are taking in their first semester. “First, we have satellite communications,” she said, which tackles the basics of how satellites can converse with ground stations on Earth. The second is a course on nanosatellite development, which covers the process of building the different subsystems, from the circuits to the antenna, of a satellite like Maya-1.

Finally, each semester has a Directed Studies course, where the students engage in hands-on experiments and testing to prepare them for the final output. This focused course handles topics that regular classes barely touch on, like planning satellite missions and prototype making, and where students get to “learn by doing”.

Putting Trust

With space technology being in its infancy in the Philippines, there is a lot of pressure resting on the shoulders of the scholars, according to former Far Eastern University (FEU) Institute of Technology faculty member Bryan Custodio. The licensed engineer used to teach courses in Electronics and Communications Engineering until a letter from UP to his institution launched his journey as FEU’s representative to the program, an honor he takes very seriously.

“The application was tough,” he said, “because this is UP Diliman. But when I read the results and I learned that I passed, I was speechless. Because I never thought they would put their faith in me to be a part of this program.”"

Few athletic disciplines are as primal, exciting, and yet as visibly violent as boxing.

The thrill of seeing an athlete physically dominating another in the ring has been one reason behind boxing’s immense following, from the age of Pancho Villa and then Flash Elorde to that of Manny Pacquiao. Despite, or perhaps due to this popularity, it is also one of the most misunderstood of all sports. Far too easy is it for casual viewers to dismiss boxing bouts as exercises in unmethodical brutality.

Marcus Jarwin Manalo of the UP College of Human Kinetics (UP CHK), however, knows that there is much more than blind aggression to the “sweet science.”

For the past five years, Manalo has served as the Sports Psychology consultant for the Philippine National Boxing Team. Armed with lessons from the ring, he is on a mission to educate athletes and coaches on the benefits of mental skills training. And a major component of that goal is his personal quest to create an ideal environment that helps our pugilists give their best, both in sports and in life.

 

Split seconds

“What I focus on are performance issues of the athletes as well as of the coaches,” says Manalo. As opposed to Clinical Sports psychologists, who deal with severe disorders like depression, his consultancy focuses on training skills like mental toughness, goal setting, concentration, and anxiety management.

“One misconception people have is that they think these skills are innate,” he notes. “Either you have them, or you don’t. Believing nothing can be done to improve these skills, many athletes act accordingly, failing to improve them despite the nominally important status of the ‘mental game’ in sports.”

In contrast, mental and physical skills are more alike than different. “Think of dribbling and shooting skills in basketball. You need to practice them regularly. Mental skills are the same. You need constant practice for them to become automatic during competitions.”

Moreover, and contrary to stereotypes, he considers emotional control to be the cornerstone of a good boxer’s mental toolkit. The science of boxing goes far beyond mere suntukan or bugbugan. In reality, all-out aggression leaves most boxers open to counterattacks. “You want to be aggressive, but also calm in the sense that you can make good decisions in the ring. And all of these decisions are happening in split seconds.”

Manalo uses mindfulness-based interventions to help his boxers manage the chaos of competition. These involve being aware of and accepting experiences in the present moment, rather than fighting them. For practice, team members are asked to use deep breathing and guided imagery techniques even before training camp. “Sometimes it’s just them lying down and focusing on the environment, and what it sounds like.”

In competitions, worries and concerns can overwhelm an athlete before the first punch is thrown. Here, mindfulness can help them to stay in the moment. Manalo says, “It lets them know that yes, they’re feeling frustrated. Then they can recognize it, acknowledge it. And then can they ask—what’s the best thing I can do now?”

Like other skills, however, it does takes practice. “You can’t just start doing mindfulness when you’re already at the Asian Games! it might not work.”

 

Establishing rapport

Tall and trim, Manalo had always been an athlete in his own right. Like many Psychology undergraduates, however, he once dreamed of going to medical school. One class that he took at the UP Department of Psychology threw a wrench into those plans.

“The class was discussing specific fields we could specialize in,” he recalls. “Like Educational Psychology and Counselling.” In that conversation, however, someone brought up Sports Psychology. His interest piqued, the soon-to-be graduate’s goals would change forever.

After graduating, Manalo pursued a diploma in Exercise and Sports Science at the UP CHK, which he followed up with a master’s degree with a concentration in Sports Psychology from Texas Tech University.

Returning to teach in 2013, he was also recruited that year into the Association of Boxing Alliances in the Philippines (ABAP), who was on the hunt for a new Sports Psychology consultant for the national squad.

“The coaches were skeptical,” he says. “If you look at the staff, at the time I was the only one who was not a boxer. It was like: how can you help us, when you haven’t experienced what we have?”"

Eight hundred kilometers southeast of Manila is Siargao Island. Much has been written in travel blogs about this surfer’s paradise, this next big thing of a tourist destination.

Like many travelers, Marja Abad has been backpacking most of her life in and out of the Philippines and has gone to Siargao. However, unlike many of them who have to the island come and gone, she chose to stay.

Immersions and encounters

Abad revealed that she was first admitted to the Theater Arts program of UP Diliman’s College of Arts and Letters. However, she decided to leave the campus and go back to Miriam College where she had finished high school, to take up general education courses. “That one time we were sent to an Aeta community in Pinatubo, it was my first immersion that got me on my foot and wanting to see more communities around the country,” she says excitedly.

She headed up north of Luzon as far as Sagada where she had more encounters with Indigenous Peoples (IP) communities. She then realized her love for community work, and finally decided to go back to UP to enroll in a Social Work degree program in the UP College of Social Work and Community Development (CSWCD).

“It was my exposure during my travels up north that encouraged me to learn more about our local and IP communities. I value them so much because they’re the ones whom I turn to whenever I go backpacking into unfamiliar places. Instagram was non-existent at the time, so these locals were really the best guide,” says Marja, a UP Mountaineer.

After graduation, Abad, a founding member of UP Sports Climbing, decided to move to Davao. As a Manileña, she also wanted a break away from the metropolis where she grew up. She became a river-rafting guide, and continued to explore the country’s south for surf spots until she set foot on Siargao Island for the first time in 2006.

“I also went back and forth to Davao and Singapore for work. And the many times I went away from Siargao, I kept coming back here,” she says. “Everything I learned from Social Work—like the urge to help communities and learn so much about our culture through the locals—reignited my desire to work with communities especially on this island. The more I stay here, the more I see the issues. Since I already have a deep connection with this place, I always want to give back and to contribute to the community.”

An island Iska

Landing a corporate job that allowed her to make the island her home, Marja finally settled in Siargao in 2015. The drive to stay on the island, while others were making it big internationally or in major industries, was strongly influenced by her UP education. She claims, “I was never like that. I wanted to stay close to nature. I wanted to be active. I wanted to hear stories. It was never my dream to climb the corporate ladder. I just wanted to travel.”

“I value so much my UP GE courses because it’s what makes you holistic. The Humanities and Social Sciences are the reasons Iskos and Iskas have a good grasp on why the world is the way it is today. I think it really helped mold me into who I am right now. UP taught me to be proud of being a Filipina because it taught me about our heroes, our history and our culture. I really take it to heart and seriously as an Iska. It is about time that I give back to the community,” she continues.

“Here, I can still do what I want—surf, have a job that allows me to still travel outside the country, and most of all turn this movement towards community and environmental sustainability work on this island,” says the overjoyed Iska.

With just a few days to go before voters troop to the polling stations for the 2019 midterm elections, several units of the University of the Philippines are busy publishing insights, fact check pieces and other materials aimed at aiding voters in their choice of candidates for the different positions in government.

An initiative which seeks to verify claims made by candidates in the campaign trail, as well as in media interviews, debates and public fora, Tsek.ph attempts to provide voters with information relating to the veracity of statements made by political hopefuls.

Tsek.ph is a joint effort of UP, the Ateneo de Manila University, De La Salle University, online news organization Rappler, investigative journalism outfit Vera Files, ABS-CBN News, Interaksyon, Radio World Broadcasting Corporation, Baguio Midland Courier, Central Luzon Television, MindaNews, Probe Productions, The Philippine Star, Philstar.com, and the university’s own radio station, DZUP.

Representatives of these institutions signed a Memorandum of Agreement in February.

Aside from publishing verification reports made by its staff and contributors, Tsek.ph also accepts submissions from individuals who have come across dubious claims made by candidates to the public and the media.

“In Tsek.ph, we have what we call a claim submission. So, the public can put out a question on the website and send a query,” said Prof. Rachel Khan of the Department of Journalism of the College of Mass Communication. “And the members of Tsek.ph are committed to research that question, for as long as it is election related.”

Also involved in the project, aside from the Department of Journalism of the College of Mass Communication, are the university’s Department of Computer Science of the College of Engineering and the College of Law.

Over at the College of Social Sciences and Philosophy, members of the Department of Political Science are also providing the electorate with insights on the issues and situations confronting the country via the UP sa Halalan 2019 project.

An international multidisciplinary team, led by University of the Philippines Associate Professor Armand Salvador B. Mijares, discovered a new human species, the Homo luzonensis, from an excavation site inside Callao Cave in Peñablanca, Cagayan.

Mijares said the hominin fossils and teeth are from at least three individuals, nicknamed Ubag after a mythical cave man, that were excavated in 2007, 2011 and 2015. He and the members of his team, paleoanthropologist Florent Détroit of the Muséum national d’Histoire naturelle, zooarchaeologist Philip Piper of Australian National University, and geochronologist Rainer Grün of Griffith University, dug up the hominin fossils from a sedimentary level located three meters below the current surface of the cave floor.

A scene in the situational video in Chapter 5: Helping the Child Cope with Treatment of the Aruga sa Batang may Cancer website

 

“You have cancer.”

No one ever wants to hear to those words. Imagine when the cancer-stricken patient is young, a child or a teenager who should still be looking forward to many experiences life has to offer.

Even more devastating is that “in the Philippines, two-thirds of pediatric patients with cancer are diagnosed at advanced stages.” This is the grim reality revealed by Prof. Loyda Cajucom of the UP Open University (UPOU) Faculty of Management and Development Studies. She is a registered nurse, and a graduate and a former faculty member of UP Manila who has firsthand experience of dealing with pediatric cancer patients.

This, along with the lack of developed palliative and supportive care programs in the country and UPOU’s leadership in open and distance e-learning, led her to spearhead “Aruga sa Batang may Cancer (ABC).” This online resource, funded by a grant from the Department of Science and Technology-Philippine Council for Health Research and Development, is dedicated to, as the name indicates, caring for children with cancer.

ABC is the first of its kind in the country.

 

The Aruga sa Batang may Cancer website can be accessed at https://arugaproject.com/.

 

Not one-size-fits-all

Dr. Rumalie Corvera, founder and executive director of Ruth Foundation, a palliative care service provider and an ABC partner, explains that palliative care is a form of assistance given to patients of life-threatening or life-limiting illnesses and their families and loved ones.

Palliative care is not limited to alleviating the physical pain of the patient, as some perceive it to be. It is a holistic approach which includes ensuring the psychosocial well-being of the patients and their loved ones as well. Sometimes, Cajucom says, the mental and emotional toll of a cancer diagnosis weighs far more heavily than the physical. “I saw it many times when I was at the Philippine General Hospital.”

Corvera says of Ruth Foundation’s experience: “It’s often the parents who have a harder time accepting their child’s illness. There are times when it’s the patient who even comforts his or her parents and tells them to be strong.”

Palliative care, which is more prevalent in Western countries, cannot simply be applied as is in the Philippines because of cultural beliefs, traditions, and attitudes. In a country where practice of and knowledge on palliative care leaves much to be desired, Cajucom and her team had to conduct assessments to get a clearer picture of what needs to be done and how. They also had the support of other partners like Kythe Foundation, Inc. and the John Wayne Cancer Institute.

 

“Parents, often mothers, have a tendency to blame themselves when their children are diagnosed with cancer. They would ask themselves, ‘What did I do wrong?’ or think they didn’t care for themselves properly when they were pregnant with their children.”—Prof. Loyda Cajucom (Photo by Misael Bacani, UP MPRO)

 

Hospitals in strategic locations across the country eagerly participated in the activities. These are: the Philippine Children’s Medical Center in Metro Manila; Bicol Regional Training and Teaching Hospital in Albay; Cebu Doctors’ University Hospital and Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in Cebu; and, Southern Philippines Medical Center in Davao.

Spearheaded by three UP units, a collaborative fact-checking project for the May 2019 elections was launched on February 11, 2019 at Quezon Hall, UP Diliman (UPD).

UP, represented by President Danilo Concepcion, entered into a memorandum of agreement (MOA) with two universities and several media organizations to establish “Tsek.ph”, a website that will be the repository of their fact-checking of claims made in connection with the May 2019 elections.

“Fact-checking is a very controversial and, often, confrontational activity,” UP Vice President for Public Affairs and Professor of Communication Research Elena Pernia said in welcoming the MOA signatories. “But good journalists and the academe, who are represented, know that it is essential, especially at this time when we are at the cusp of national elections.”

According to the MOA, the project arose from “growing threats of disinformation and misinformation in traditional and online media that affect the health of democratic countries and the power of the citizens to make informed choices during elections.”

In the initial batch of fact-checking partners are: UP, the Ateneo de Manila University (ADMU), De La Salle University (DLSU); and media organizations, namely, ABS-CBN Corp., Interaksyon, Philstar.com, Probe Productions Inc., the Philippine Star, Radio World Broadcasting Corp., Rappler, and Vera Files.

Amidst COVID-19 troubles on the ground, the nation looked to space for hope on August 6, 2020 as the “space sector” behind the launch of and knowledge product creation through the first ever Philippine-made microsatellites held a press briefing. The event, “Our Place in Space: What’s Next for the Philippines Space Sector?”, invited the media for a virtual discussion over Zoom to talk about what’s next in terms of research and development (R&D) from the sector a year after the Philippine Space Agency (PhilSA) was officially established with Republic Act 11363.

 

DOST Secretary Fortunato de la Peña giving the opening remarks. Screenshot from the replay of the press briefing here.

 

The organizations that make up the sector are: the PhilSA; the UP-led STAMINA4Space Program, which succeeded with the much lauded PHL-Microsat project in developing the country’s capacities in small satellite technology; and the Department of Science and Technology Advanced Science and Technology Institute (DOST-ASTI).

The briefing was composed of presentations by seven speakers from different corners of the space sector, each giving updates on the latest developments in their space-related R&D specialties.

 

Engr. Harold Bryan Paler, Senior Science Research Specialist at the DOST-ASTI, talks about PEDRO. Screenshot from the replay of the press briefing here.

 

The first presentation came from Engr. Harold Bryan Paler, Senior Science Research Specialist at the DOST-ASTI. Paler talked of the Philippine Earth Data Resources and Observation Center (PEDRO Center), which is the country’s ground monitoring station for satellites. The primary function of PEDRO is to monitor, give commands, and receive data from the project’s earth observation satellites,such as Diwata-2. It has independent stations with corresponding tracking antennae in all three major islands of the Philippines: in UP Diliman, Quezon City for Luzon; in Dumangas, Iloilo for the Visayas; and, in Davao City for Mindanao.These stations track the satellites from horizon to horizon. It also boasts of the Computing and Archiving Research Environment or COARE to store and process the often large-sized images that satellites produce.

The next two presentations strictly dealt with the many present and future ways that data from satellites can be applied to disaster risk reduction, and to agricultural and environmental efforts. Engr. Roel de la Cruz of the DOST-ASTI discussed how the DATOS project uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to translate satellite derived data into mapping and monitoring solutions for floods, land cover, seasonal crops, and calamities, among other applications. For example, using radar satellites that pass every 12 days, his team can determine the signatures that differentiate sugarcane from rice, corn, and other crops. Doing so, the team can now map and monitor plantations like these in the country and currently have agreements with government agencies to accomplish this feat.

Similarly, UP researcher Mark Jayson Felix of STAMINA4Space showed how optical imagery can be used to track changes in the environment. These space technology applications are used to track air and water quality, as well as to do econometric work. Included in this work is the surprising finding that higher levels of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) in the air appeared to have a relationship with the number of COVID-19 fatalities in areas they studied. This, according to Felix, mirrored similar studies in Europe that found similar relationships that he hoped could be used to improve air quality without severely compromising the economy.

These series of presentations were punctuated by the unveiling of the Space Data Dashboard where one can view relevant research outputs from the various projects mapped on the web. The team displayed its capabilities by running over the dashboard’s COVID-19 pertinent functions to the media.

Moving from data applications to building the satellites of the future, Engr. Delburg Mitchao of STAMINA4Space discussed building actual satellites locally, in the past and the future. He discussed the locally developed modules developed for Diwata-2: the amateur radio payload, the attitude control unit, and the sun aspect sensor. He noted how the future of microsatellite development lies in creating the satellite “bus”, or the vehicle where these modules are contained, as well as a local onboard computer that interfaces with communication modules (UTACH) and aids in its control.

When the COVID-19 pandemic drastically transformed the educational landscape around the globe earlier this year, Filipinos had little choice but to accept the fact that much of teaching and learning in the foreseeable future would have to be done digitally. While this transition, as described in a Memorandum of the UP Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs (OVPAA) dated June 4, 2020, had long been prepared for, no doubt present circumstances accelerated its implementation by at least a few years.

A key concern of the University regarding this digital shift is equalizing access to knowledge for students, given the tendency of technology to exacerbate pre-existing socio-economic divisions between the financially more and the less capable. This concern spurred the creation of efforts such as the #KaagapayUP project to bridge this divide and help financially challenged students have a fighting chance to do online classes on more even terms.

Several UP alumni, including Julliano Fernando ‘Jules’ Guiang, a National College of Public Administration and Governance (NCPAG) alumnus and graduate student, were similarly struck by the inequities highlighted by the pandemic. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Guiang, who is also a journalist, had launched The Hatch Hub, a co-working space on Maginhawa Street, Sikatuna Village, Quezon City with his friends. At first, they envisioned it to be an affordable establishment where students and professionals could study, meet, work, and hold events.

Forging a partnership   

With the COVID-19 pandemic, however, Guiang and his partners realized the need to shift their focus. While other businesses were struggling to keep afloat, they knew that The Hatch Hub had the potential to help at least UP students nearby to meet the challenges of the coming academic year.

“Moving forward,” Guiang said, “I thought, why not offer [The Hatch Hub] for students who don’t have a conducive space with strong internet connection?”"

Until four months ago, Patrick Pabulayan’s life, while full of escalating challenges, had been fairly straightforward.

He was in ninth grade at the Notre Dame of Marbel University, Koronadal City, South Cotabato, when he started out on the path of life as a student athlete.

Upon graduating from high school, he chose UP over another university because, according to him, “mas mataas yung standard, kaya kung makapag-graduate ka dito, maraming opportunity na mag-o-open para sa yo [the standards are higher, and when you graduate from UP a lot of opportunities will open up for you].” Having trained well in his chosen sport, he was selected by Coach Rio Dela Cruz to join the UP Track and Field Team.

As a freshman and now an incoming second year student at the UP Diliman College of Human Kinetics (UP CHK) currently enrolled in a Bachelor in Physical Education degree program, Patrick found life in UP more challenging than his previous life, “kasi sa varsity, mahirap po ipagsabay yung sports at tsaka acads [because as a student athlete and varsity team member, we have to balance sports and our academics,” he said.

And the training is rigorous. He and his teammates would wake up at 4:00 a.m. to go and train at ULTRA Pasig or at the Rizal National High School. Later, they would go to class. “Minsan, nakakapagod pero enjoy din kasi maraming mga VAAS [Varsity Athletic Admission System athletes] na makikita mo talaga yung patience at tsaka pursigido talaga sila. Tapos medyo mahirap talaga kasi yung kailangan ko pang mag-adjust dito pag dating ng Maynila kasi galing po ako sa province namin [It was tiring but I enjoyed it because you really get to see how patient and persevering the varsity athletes are. Then of course, there was the adjustment period I went through here in Manila, coming from our province],” he said.

Patrick, then a dormer at the Ipil Residence Hall, had been looking forward to the next challenge: completing the 21 academic units he signed up for during the semester and competing in the new UAAP Season. But with the COVID-19 pandemic escalating and the quarantines instituted, his next challenge turned out to be at a level nobody could have foreseen.

“Hindi mawala yung pangamba na meron din tayong mga families sa province na naiwan. Dahil sa lockdown nawalan sila ng trabaho, parang saan sila kukuha ng mga pangangailangan nila. [There was worry for our families in our provinces, who because of the lockdown had lost jobs and the means to meet their needs],” he said. “Tapos ako dito medyo okey, kasi merong may nag-do-donate, may mga blessing na dumadating sa amin dito every week noong first and second month namin dito [At least here, we were in a better place because there were people who gave donations during the first and second month of lockdown].”

Eugene Laganina, a second-year student at the UP Diliman College of Human Kinetics who comes from Umingan, Pangasinan, is not one to shy away from hard work, whether it is balancing between academics and training as a member of the UP Men’s Volleyball Team or working at a farm during the months of lockdown to save up for the future.

How he found himself from living a typical UP student-athlete’s life in UP Diliman’s campus to being in a lush bukid in Sta. Ines, San Miguel, Bulacan, staying at his eldest sibling’s place, is a bit of a story in and of itself. “Actually, sabi nila one-week class suspension lang daw, so umuwi muna ako sa kapatid ko sa probinsya [Actually, they told us at first that it was just going to be a one-week class suspension; so I went to my half-sister’s home],” he said. (Eugene is the third in a family of four siblings, with his older brother supporting his and his youngest sister’s studies through college.)

“And then sa following days, in-announce ulit na magiging one-month class suspension kasi lumalala na daw yung coronavirus, so naging pandemic na sya. So nag-isip-isip ako, ‘Paano na lang yung nakasanayan ko—yung pag-aaral at yung training ko? Ano na mangyayari sa akin dito? [And then in the following days, it was announced that the class suspension would extend to a month because the coronavirus situation had worsened into a pandemic. So I wondered, ‘What will happen to my studies and training? What will happen to me here?’]” he went on.

Nag-isip ako kung anong magagawa ko para makatulong ako sa mga magulang o mga kapatid ko.

His first concern was helping his family. “Nag-isip ako kung anong magagawa ko para makatulong ako sa mga magulang o mga kapatid ko. So tutal, probinsya naman ito, naglakas-loob ako na magtanong sa mga kasama ko kung okey lang ba na pumasok sa pagiging trabahador sa bukid [I thought about what I could do to help my parents and siblings. So since we were in the province, I worked up the nerve to ask if it was all right for me to work at the farm],” he recalled.

‘Rule of Law’ key to defending PH sovereignty – Justice Carpio – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/rule-of-law-key-to-defending-ph-sovereignty-justice-carpio/,"

It was 1995, UP College of Law alumnus and retired Justice Antonio Carpio said, when China first seized Mischief Reef, a submerged atoll located within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone (EEZ) on the West Philippine Sea. At that time Chief Presidential Legal Counsel for former President Fidel V. Ramos, Carpio remembered how with neither a formidable military nor recourse to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas (UNCLOS), the nation could only watch as a more powerful state grabbed territory from a weaker one without consequence.

“China demonstrated to the world that might makes right,” Carpio said. And with China claiming up to 80% of the country’s territory on the West Philippine Sea, this would only be the beginning. “It was obvious that Mischief Reef would neither be the first nor the last geologic feature that China would seize from the Philippines.”

In his acceptance speech after receiving a Doctor of Laws honoris causa degree from the University of the Philippines on December 10, 2020 at UP Diliman’s Malcolm Hall, Carpio narrated how this event that “left a scar in (his) mind” would later help influence his spirited defense of the country’s sovereign rights on the West Philippine Sea by questioning China’s claims to the territory via its ‘9-dashed line.’

It would be in 2011, after Carpio wrote the unanimous decision to Magallona v. Executive Secretary that amended the country’s archipelagic baseline to conform to UNCLOS, that he realized that the country now had its territorial house in order and could build a better territorial case against China. Two months after this decision, with the Philippines fully UNCLOS-compliant, Carpio led the charge along with fellow lawyers and intellectuals to bring China’s ‘9-dashed line’ claims before an UNCLOS tribunal.

“China’s 9-dashed line simply cannot co-exist with UNCLOS. Upholding one means killing the other,” said Carpio in a speech at the 50th anniversary of the Ateneo de Davao College of Law. The challenge, thenceforth, was to bring the case before UNCLOS, given China previously opting out of compulsory arbitration."

UP marked the first UP Day of Remembrance by concretizing plans to construct the country’s memorial for victims of human rights violations during the Marcos regime.

 

UP President Danilo L. Concepcion signed on September 21, 2018 a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Human Rights Violations Victims’ Memorial Commission (HRVVMC) formalizing institutional partnership in establishing the Human Rights Violations Victims’ Memorial in UP Diliman.

“Higit sa alinmang pook, dito sa ating pamantasan sumibol at lumago ang puno ng pagtutol at pag-aalsa; kung kaya dito rin naman nadama ang mabigat na dagok ng panunupil at pananamantala noong panahon ng martial law ni Pangulong Marcos (More than any place, the University is where resistance and uprising sprang and grew; and that is why this was also where the brunt of repression and abuse of President Marcos’s martial law fell),” Concepcion said.

Sa araw na ito tayo ay nagpapasya na ikintal sa puso at damdamin ang dakilang alaala ng mga araw ng pakikibaka, ng mga taong nagsakripisyo at nagbuwis ng buhay, upang ito kailanman ay hindi malimutan at hindi na maulit pa (On this day, we decide to commit the legacy of the days of struggle, of the many who sacrificed their lives; so that they will never be forgotten and [their fates] never repeated),” Concepcion added. “Ito ang ating dasal, ito ang ating banal na panata (This is our prayer, this is our sacred promise),” he added.

 

Four days before the MOU signing, Concepcion signed a proclamation designating September 21, 2018 and September 21 of every year thereafter as “UP Day of Remembrance” in honor of the sacrifice of the University’s “best and brightest” for the struggle against dictatorship and despotism, many of whom died resisting the abuses of the Marcos regime. [Watch the proclamation signing.]

 

During the First Quarter Storm, UP being a bastion of academic freedom became a sanctuary for activism, with the AS (Arts and Sciences now Palma Hall) Steps—the venue of the MOU signing—becoming default venue and assembly area for rallies and demonstrations.

Witness to the MOU signing and representing HRVVs, Bagong Alyansang Makabayan Chair Carol Araullo quoted former Faculty Regent and anti-martial law activist Judy Taguiwalo in the latter’s UP Day of Remembrance proclamation speech, which spoke about 3,257 killed, 35,000 tortured, 1,838 disappeared, and 70,000 imprisoned during the Marcos regime. The Bantayog ng mga Bayani Foundation has thus far listed 85 martyrs of the Marcos regime from UP.

“This is a historic day that is a legacy of President Danilo Concepcion. If in my student days, we had Salvador P. Lopez who stood against the emerging Marcos dictatorship, we now have President Concepcion to thank for this step of remembering… which is important in weeding out the root causes and pre-conditions of martial law that remain to this day,” Araullo said in Filipino.

 

Signing for the HRVVMC were its co-chairs Jose Luis Martin “Chito” Gascon of the Commission on Human Rights (CHR), represented by CHR Commissioner Leah Armamento, and Rene Escalante of the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP). Established in 2013, HRVVMC was created for the “establishment, restoration, preservation and conservation of the Memorial/Museum/Library/Compendium in honor of the HRVVs during the Marcos regime.”

“The CHR looks forward to deepening partnership with the University community in developing different programs in the field of transitional justice and human rights, and commits itself to participating in an inclusive process of interacting with all stakeholders—both in and outside the University—of these will begin a broad cross-sectoral consultation on the vision for this freedom memorial,” Gascon’s message said.

Escalante revealed the NHCP holding talks with the Concepcion administration as early as last year for a place to build the HRVV memorial. Some of the documents lined up for the memorial are the Netherlands documents being kept by the UP Library, Presidential Commission on Good Government digital copy files kept by the NHCP, and documents from the HRV Claims Board.

The only child of a single mother living in their hometown of Surallah, South Cotabato, UP Diliman freshman Peter Lachica is aware of the risks of the viral disease that has brought the world to a standstill. The knowledge that there are more confirmed COVID-19 cases in Quezon City than in South Cotabato and the very real danger of bringing this virus home with him are the reasons he is having second thoughts about going home, even though he and his fellow UP students staying in the dormitories have longed to return to their families for months.

“Iyan din yung worry ko [That’s what I’m worried about],” he confessed, noting that the last few people who went home initially tested negative but then picked up the virus en route home.

Another reason he’s having second thoughts: the challenges of completing his academic requirements in all his subjects. As a Bachelor of Physical Education student at the UP College of Human Kinetics (UP CHK) and a member of the UP Track and Field Team, Peter has been hard at work completing the 18 academic units he took for the last semester, a job made more difficult given severe limitations involved.

 

 

He recalls what life was like before the pandemic and the lockdown. “Shempre po masaya. Napupuntahan namin lahat ng gusto namin. Nakakapag-training kami sa Acad Oval, and then nagte-training kami dyan sa [Athletic] Oval. Masaya po kasi kasama naming kumain yung teammate namin, nagkwekwentuhan, may regular class, minsan nagwo-worry ka kasi may assignment na gagawin, sasakay ng jeep, ganon. Normally ginagawa ng isang UP student [It was fun. We could go anywhere we wanted. We could train at the Academic Oval and Athletic Oval. We’d have fun eating out and chatting with our teammates. We had regular classes, and sometimes we’d worry about the assignments we had to do, about taking the jeep to get to class on time . . . things that a UP student would normally do,” he said.

Having no laptop or personal computer of his own had not been that big an issue, since Peter was able to use the computers at the UP CHK, at the library in Palma Hall or in the College of Arts and Letters. Other times, he managed with his cell phone and his access to free WIFI through UP DilNet.

Then with the escalation of the COVID-19 outbreak and the resulting quarantine, everything changed."

ML@50: UP holds 5th Day of Remembrance to mark 50 years since martial law declaration – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/ml50-up-holds-5th-day-of-remembrance-to-mark-50-years-since-martial-law-declaration/,"



On September 21, 1972, President Ferdinand E. Marcos signed Proclamation No. 1081 declaring martial law over the entire country, supposedly responding to the rising “communist threat” at the time.

This year marks the 50th anniversary of this declaration that led to a decades-long period in Philippine history remembered for its authoritarian rule, a record of human rights abuses, repression of basic freedoms and freedom of the press, and unmitigated corruption and theft by those in power that left much of the country in poverty.

This September 21 Wednesday, the University of the Philippines (UP) joins the nation in remembering and honoring the heroes, activists, and human rights victims who stood against martial law and the Marcos regime. This remembrance of struggle and sacrifice is made more poignant and urgent now in a time of disinformation, fake news, and historical revisionism.

In this year’s UP Day of Remembrance, with the theme, “Manindigan sa Katotohanan, Itanghal ang Katarungan,” the University will again commemorate the legacy of resistance and heroism of these activists, many of whom are members of the UP community. As with the previous years’ Days of Remembrance, UP will hold a series of activities and events, both online and in person, in all constituent universities of the UP System across the country to share these stories with the younger generations of Iskolar ng Bayan and other patriotic Filipinos and keep the flame of truth and justice alive.

This year also marks the fifth UP Day of Remembrance since UP President Danilo L. Concepcion signed. On September 17, 2018, Proclamation No. 1, Series of 2018, declared September 21 every year as UP Day of Remembrance.

The UP Day of Remembrance events and activities are as follows:

UP SYSTEM

Historians’ Meet
September 21, 2022
1:00-5:00 pm
TVUP Studio, 5th Floor Student Union Building, UP Diliman

The Historians’ Meet is the lead event of the UP Day of Remembrance 2022 with the theme, “Manindigan sa Katotohanan, Itanghal ang Katarungan,” in line with the 50th anniversary of Proclamation No. 1081 that placed the whole country under martial law. In September 2018, UP President Danilo L. Concepcion signed Proclamation No. 1, Series of 2018, declaring September 21 of every year as UP Day of Remembrance throughout the University of the Philippines System to commemorate the struggles and sacrifices of the people during the martial law period.

Briefly, the Meet seeks to reckon with the return of the Marcoses to Malacanang and the role that historians critical of Marcos rule, past, and present, may have to play. The Meet seeks to highlight the importance of history and its methods in truth-telling and fighting historical distortion and disinformation.

The Meet shall consist of two parts. Part 1 (1:00-3:00 pm) will be an intimate discussion on the situation, possible courses of action, and resolutions. Part 2 (3:00-5:00 pm) will be a roundtable forum, open to the public, that will feature thoughts from historians, social activists, and participants. It will announce the most important resolutions from Part 1 and present a common declaration on Marcos’s return.

In the Roundtable Forum, we have invited Dr. Maria Serena Diokno, Brod. Karl Gaspar, Dr. Ferdinand Llanes, and Dr. Rowena Boquiren speak on specific themes, each theme running along the lines of imparting lessons from the past and sharing methods in generating narratives on the truths of dictatorial rule.

5th Public History Symposium
October 7, 2022
2:00 pm–5:00 pm
via Zoom

In 2018, the UP Department of History launched the “Public History Symposium” as a key event of “BuKAS: Pagdiriwang ng Buwan ng Kasaysayan sa UP Diliman.” The symposium features paper presentations on public history by academics, public history practitioners, and history enthusiasts. It also aims to serve as a platform for engagement between the Department and various stakeholders in the practice of history outside the academe, especially the multiple publics. In the symposium, the Department invites a leading historian to deliver the keynote address and two to three non-academic practitioners to form a panel of speakers.

This year’s symposium remembers the 50th anniversary of Ferdinand Marcos Sr.’s declaration of Martial Law and commemorates the countless Filipinos who resisted and perished during Marcos’ authoritarian rule. In this view, the Fifth Public History Symposium is slated shortly after the university-wide commemorations in September and August, which are traditionally held. The keynote lecture will be delivered by Dr. Ferdinand C. Llanes, Professor of the UP Department of History and editor of Tibak Rising: Activism in the Days of Martial Law (Anvil Publishing, 2012), an anthology of essays and reminiscences on the daily lives of student activists who fought and resisted the Marcos dictatorship.

National Training Seminar for Teachers of Philippine History
December 9, 2022
9:00 am–4:00 pm
via Zoom

The Professional Education Series (PROFESS) of the UP College of Social Sciences and Philosophy (UP CSSP) provides an excellent opportunity for professional enhancement for educators and practitioners in the social sciences and philosophy. The training consists of an intensive two-day course in one area of study that equips educators and practitioners with the latest trends and updates in the discipline. It aims to review the basic foundations of the field and introduce pedagogical interventions for each domain.

For two consecutive years, the UP Department of History has conducted the National Training Seminar for Teachers of Philippine History as a component of the College of Social Sciences and Philosophy (CSSP) Professional Education Series (PROFESS) Program. It aims to contribute to the capacity building of Philippine history teachers at both the basic and tertiary education levels. In 2018, the training was designed to update the content of topics and themes on Philippine history. The following year focused on mapping the essential truths relevant to the teaching of Martial Law years in the Philippines (1972-1986) outlined by the Human Rights Violations Victims’ Memorial Commission (HRVVMC). The training slated for 2020 was canceled due to the current public health crisis. Last year, the training focused on sharing good practices in teaching Philippine history in a remote learning context. It was also designed to serve as a platform for students to share their remote learning experiences and insights.

This year marks the 50th year of the martial declaration that spurred the Marcos dictatorship. It is in this context that the Department intends to organize a training program this year that aims to: (a) discuss the role and relevance of history in the present context; (b) examine sources and discourses relevant to the Marcos dictatorship and the contemporary Philippines; and, (c) introduce pedagogical interventions pertinent to the teaching of the topics mentioned above.

Aside from the events and activities commemorating the UP Day of Remembrance at the UP System level, each UP constituent unit is holding its series of events. Iskolar ng bayan, UP community members, and the general public are invited to participate.

UP Mindanao Chancellor Larry Digal in his message said, “Hopefully, these maps will help the local communities located along the Davao Gulf to understand and be aware of how climate change, human actions, and government efforts affect the overall health of our coastal resources, the stability of the fishery sector, and the livelihood conditions of local fishing communities.”

DNSC President Joy Sorrosa for her part said, “The recommendations will be the essence in the crafting of policies that will capacitate the local government units in prevention, mitigation, conservation, and sustainability measures to address the devastating impact of climate change. It is my fervent hope to utilize and steward the outputs of this project to contribute and provide solutions to the local government units for whatever climate-related issues we will have in the future.”

The project produced some 76 maps for 17 LGUs. The Natural Disaster Vulnerability Assessment Maps, Coastal Resource Vulnerability Assessment Maps, and Aquaculture Vulnerability Assessment Maps showed the areas with weaknesses. The Fishing Livelihood Maps, Bathymetry (depth) Maps, and Coastal Resource Maps showed the characteristics of the coastal resources. The project team also presented the End-User Licensing Agreement for the maps.

UP students and admin meet to assess remote learning and teaching experience – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/up-students-and-admin-meet-to-assess-remote-learning-and-teaching-experience/,"


Student representatives and officials of the University of the Philippines (UP) met in an online town hall session on September 20, 2021. The meeting aims to help the University take stock of its experience of remote learning and teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic as it prepares academic roadmaps.

Featured in the conference “Birtual na Pagpupulong bilang Paghahanda sa Pagpaplanong Akademiko sa 2021” were results of surveys of constituents conducted by the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs (OVPAA), the Office of Student Regent (OSR), and the student councils (USCs) of all constituent universities (CUs).

UPLB Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Janette J. Malata-Silva (left) hosted the program, introducing UP Assistant Vice President for Academic Affairs Evangeline Amor. Images from the Facebook livestream of the town hall session.

‘Overwhelmed’

Assistant Vice President for Academic Affairs Evangeline Amor presented the OVPAA Report on Student and Faculty Survey on Remote Learning based on surveys by the UP System Committee on Remote Teaching and Learning. The surveys involved 8,679 students in November 2020 and 9,237 in July 2021, constituting roughly 17-18 percent of the total students enrolled in the respective semesters. The surveys of the faculty involved more than 1,300 respondents each.

From the surveys, eight of 10 student respondents felt “overwhelmed” by their study load, and only three of 10 felt “satisfied” by the experience.

According to the July 2021 survey, undergraduate students who were “overwhelmed” and “dissatisfied” had an “unreasonable” 17-19 units load for which they spent 56 hours per week. Undergraduate students who responded as “not overwhelmed” and “satisfied” and who said they had “reasonable load” had 15 to17 units loads for which they spent 41 hours in a week. A majority, or 6.5 out of 10 students, said their internet connectivity was “ok.”

 

Screenshots from UP AVPAA Amor’s presentation of survey results. Images from the Facebook livestream of the town hall session.

 

For undergraduate student respondents, staying motivated was the number one problem. For graduate students, it was balancing their schedule for studies and work. The biggest concern or worry for undergraduate student respondents was their health. They were in front of their gadgets most of the time

Impressions of the remote learning experience included “no learning,” particularly of laboratory skills, loneliness, and learning just for the sake of complying or passing. Others cited “unreasonable increase in academic standards,” “unconducive learning,” “insufficient time,” “issues on learning materials,” and “poor internet connectivity.”

The surveys indicated that student respondents found detailed course guides as most helpful, and instructor availability and responsiveness contributed most to effective learning. Library services were considered the most significant support received from UP.

However, the majority of the student respondents were neutral to the questions “Did the resolutions on academic policies ease stress?” and “Did the assistance from the University help me learn effectively?”

The students were also asked by the surveys for the assistance they needed. Primarily, they mentioned services for mental health, vaccines, counseling, and reading breaks. Forms of academic ease were then mentioned. Other responses were financial and equipment subsidy, more flexible learning, technical assistance, and assistance for internet connectivity and a conducive environment.

‘LNBE’

The Office of the Student Regent conducted its survey during a week in August 2021 and gathered responses from 904 student respondents or 0.02 percent of the student population, according to the presenter, UP Baguio Student Council Chair Cheska Kapunan.

From there, the OSR cited reports of deadlines not being adjusted despite leniency requests. Deadlines and synchronous classes were being set during the reading break. Some teachers insisted on holding online sessions “where attendance was required, graded, or made a major component of grades.” In addition, students were not being provided recordings of online classes. Students also reported delays in receiving their modules. Many of these modules were said to be incomplete or lacking in explanation.

Student leaders also independently gathered feedback from their respective constituents. They were campaigning for a safe and gradual return to face-to-face classes and the use of the physical facilities of the school, or “ligtas na balik-eskwela,” a vaccination program for students, more vigorous implementation of academic ease, and expedition of processes of the Student Learning Assistance System (SLAS).

They highlighted the need for students to be included in the University’s planning and not just consulted. Student Regent Renee Louise Co requested that the sector be provided copies of the drafts of the academic roadmaps.

The UP Manila representative Querobin Acsibar reported on the call for a stop and review of the Return Service Agreement in the health colleges of the campus.

The students expressed support in opposing the government’s planned budget cuts on UP.

They also cited the need for psychosocial services and safe spaces to protect UP constituents from red-tagging, sexual harassment, and in-campus violence.

Balancing acts

“It’s a balancing act between compassion especially for students in difficult circumstances… and the responsibility if not the mission of UP to ensure that the Iskolar ng Bayan, the country’s future leaders in different branches of knowledge, possess the competence, grit, and agility to overcome adversities, to thrive and lead in a complex, disruptive world,” VPAA Cynthia Bautista said in her reaction on the rationale of administrative policies. She referred to a world dealing with a pandemic, climate change, and the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

At the same time, she said: “We are beginning to be more nuanced since we cannot continue having a one-size-fits-all policy for students.”

Regarding academic ease, Bautista said there is a need to balance the demand of students for more time with the time available to the faculty to complete requirements. There is also a need to reconsider students’ interests. Within an increasingly learner-centered environment, the load eventually bears upon the faculty.

“You can just flag the administration, and actually they did something about this,” Bautista told the students regarding complaints on non-conformity with guidelines on academic ease.

Action points

On “balik-eskwela”: “A committee of the Presidential Advisory Council, chaired by UP Los Baños Chancellor Jose Camacho with UP Diliman Chancellor Fidel Nemenzo and UP Manila Chancellor Carmencita Padilla as members, is helping us in various aspects of the preparation from the reconfiguring of classrooms to student vaccination to the protocol for a class when a student tests positive to a policy [on unvaccinated constituents without sacrificing inclusivity],” Bautista said.

She added that UP had submitted, reiterated, adjusted, and completed supplementary information on the request for the limited face-to-face for graduating students to the technical working groups of the IATF (Interagency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases) and the Commission on Higher Education. However, remote learning will still be the prevailing mode for as long as the COVID-19 situation remains.

Never again. Never forget.

These words hark back to a dark period in the country’s history that must never be forgotten nor willfully erased—not if we wish to elect good leaders and create a better future for our children.

The University of the Philippines (UP) is inviting all Filipino students, educators, and citizens to this year’s UP Days of Remembrance, a week-long commemoration to honor the struggle of the Filipino people under the authoritarian regime and UP’s contribution to the uprising against the Marcos dictatorship."

Gawad Plaridel recipient for 2018 Jessica Soho, a broadcast journalist, talked about her career before Mass Communication students, scholars, and practitioners from different schools and organizations, in a skills enhancement seminar on January 21, 2019 in the UP Film Institute Studio, UP Diliman.

The host of the popular television magazine show, “Kapuso Mo Jessica Soho”, on GMA 7 and anchor of primetime news telecast, “State of the Nation”, on GMA News TV expressed her values of good story-telling, hard work, and honesty. She traced these to her maternal and paternal grandmothers, one of whom sold meat in the market.

“I want to keep it real,” Soho said. “The market is the place to be if you want to feel the vibe and pulse of the place and its people,” she stressed.

“The best stories are there, too, if you bother to talk and listen to the sellers, farmers, fishermen, middlemen, et cetera. It is also where I gather feedback. . .  if we are connecting to our target audience,” she explained.

“I guess you can call all that research,” Soho emphasized.

The anniversary of the signing of Proclamation No. 1081 by Ferdinand Marcos, placing the Philippines under Martial Law, is coming up on September 21. And yet, 49 years later, we continue to deal with lies, misinformation and historical revisionism of Martial Law and the Marcos regime on various media platforms.

This coming week, scholars of history and the social sciences from the University of the Philippines (UP) and other universities here and abroad will team up with human rights activists to set the record straight regarding the myths of Martial Law and the Marcos regime through the UP Days of Remembrance. This is the University’s week-long virtual commemoration that aims to honor the struggle of the Filipino people under the authoritarian regime and UP’s contribution to the uprising against the Marcos dictatorship. It will be held from September 20 to 24, 2021, from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon.

With the theme, “Dambana ng Gunita: Mga Batayang Katotohanan at Aral ng Batas Militar”, the commemoration will go in depth on the specific issues that often fall prey to misinformation, such as: Marcos’s alleged heroism; the supposed peaceful society during the Martial Law years; the truth with regard to human rights violations under the Marcos regime; the myth of an economic golden age under the Marcoses; and, the rampant corruption and cronyism of the Marcos administration that set our country back decades. This will be done through educational discussions and conversations on what really happened during the dark years of the Marcos regime."

UP protests against threat to academic freedom – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/up-protests-against-threat-to-academic-freedom/,"

Without academic freedom, the University of the Philippines (UP) would lose its meaning and purpose.

This was the statement issued by UP President Danilo L. Concepcion during the quick-response indignation rally held in the morning of January 19, in response to the letter issued by Department of National Defense (DND) Secretary Delfin N. Lorenzana unilaterally terminating the UP-DND Accord, action which many members of the UP community regard as a grave threat to the University’s academic freedom and security.

The quick-response rally was organized by the youth sector of the University of the Philippines System and Diliman under the broad-based alliance, UP Rise Against Tyranny and Dictatorship or UPRISE, with other sectors, including members of the lumad community from the Save Our Schools Network. The rally joins the clamor on social media by other members of the UP community protesting the abrupt move by the DND to unilaterally abrogate the Accord, without prior consultation with UP.

 

The UP-DND Accord

The UP-DND Accord, which was signed on June 30, 1989 by then UP President Jose Abueva and then Secretary of Defense Fidel V. Ramos, established certain norms and protocols governing relations between the University and military and police forces. These protocols include, among others, that prior notification shall be given by the Armed Forces of the Philippines or the Philippine National Police to the UP administration before conducting any military or police operations in any of the UP campuses of the eight UP constituent universities, and that, except in cases of hot pursuit or similar emergencies or ordinary transit through UP premises, no member of the AFP or PNP shall enter the premises of any of the UP campuses.

The UP-DND Accord was preceded by the Soto-Enrile Accord of 1981, which stemmed from a letter from then Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile to former League of Filipino Students national chair Sonia Soto. This was intended to protect schools and their students, faculty and staff from police and military incursions intended to suppress dissent and protest actions.

UP as a “safe space”

 

“Maraming hindi lubos na nakakaunawa sa kalahagahan ng Accord na ito [There are many who do not completely understand the significance of this Accord],” Concepcion stated, addressing the UP students, faculty, staff and officials who gathered during the rally. “Ang Accord na ito ang nagbibigay kalayaan sa ating mga estudyante at ating mga guro na maging malikhain at mapusok sa pag-iisip at paglikha, sapagkat alam nila na walang susupil sa kanilang mga gawain, na walang magmamanman sa kanilang bawat kilos at galaw, na walang pipigil sa kanilang pagpapahayag ng kanilang mga kaisipan at malayang pagtatagisan ng talino at kuro-kuro [This Accord grants our students and faculty the freedom to be creative and passionate in their thought and works, because they know that no one will suppress them, or monitor their every move, or stop them from the free expression of their views and intellectual debate],” he continued.

UP Diliman Chancellor Fidel Nemenzo, on his part, expressed his “grave concern” with the unilateral abrogation of the memorandum of agreement between UP and the DND and his objection to it on several grounds.

Nemenzo said that first, the Accord is constructive and has effectively promoted good will between the two institutions, as well as fostered a mutual respect for each other’s mandate and mechanisms for dialogue and resolutions. Second, the unilateral abrogation of the Accord denies UP its right to academic freedom, which as Concepcion also stressed, is founded on a constitutional right.

“If the DND says, as it does, that it would neither post military or police inside UP’s campuses, nor suppress academic freedom and freedom of expression, why abrogate the Accord?” Nemenzo pointed out.

Finally, the Accord itself states that nothing within it shall be construed as prohibition against the enforcement of the laws of the land.

“Scuttling the Accord strikes a dangerous blow to academic freedom, because it sends the message that intellectual and cultural inquiry, which is sacred in our University, has limits,” Nemenzo warned. He also cited the historical significance of the Accord. “The Accord was a democratic response to the suppression of UP and of freedoms during Martial Law. This year is the 50th anniversary of the Diliman Commune and next year is the 50th anniversary of the imposition of Martial Law. The Accord stands as a testament to the University’s actions on behalf of academic freedom. This is why we should and will defend UP as a safe space, a zone for free thought and free speech. Academic freedom and our University have to be protected and defended at all times.”

Like Nemenzo, new UP Student Regent Renee Louise Co cited the historical significance and meaning of the UP-DND Accord in her statement during the indignation rally. “Ang pagtanggal ng UP-DND Accord ay isang napakalaking insulto sa napakaraming mga iskolar ng bayan na nagsakripisyo at nagpakita ng kanilang mga magagawa para pagsilbihan ang sambayanan [The termination of the UP-DND Accord is a huge insult to the many iskolar ng bayan who sacrificed and struggled to serve the people].”

 

On the right side of history

 

Dr. Jay Batongbacal, Executive Associate Dean of the UP College of Law, assured the rally-goers that the UP College of Law is prepared to extend assistance to UP students and student organizations, faculty, staff and other UP sectors. “Rest assured that there are many of us ready to defend our freedom of thought and our freedom of speech. We will stand by you to defend the academic freedom of the University of the Philippines.”

UP Diliman Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Louise Jashil R. Sonido, on her part, credited the courage, determination, unity and solidarity of the youth sector of UP. “To all those who continue to doubt and underestimate our youth, enough. Because the kids are all right. They are here and unafraid. They will stand their ground on the right side of history, and they will be remembered for their strength and vigilance, for their relentless service to the people despite red-tagging, despite political persecution, despite big bullies in government picking on them and pointing their guns at them. Our weapon is our criticism, our insolence, our daring, our defiance. History will remember that in the line of fire, UP stood its ground and it will not back down. We will defend the University.”

Other speakers included representatives of various UP student organizations and student councils and activist groups, such as: the National Union of Students of the Philippines (NUSP); Kilusang Mayo Uno (KMU); NNARA Youth; Congress of Teachers/Educators for Nationalism and Democracy (CONTEND)-UP Diliman; Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT); Bahaghari; KATRIBU; KADAMAY; GABRIELA; and, Kabataan Partylist Representative Sarah Jane Elago.

Echo the watchword: #DefendUP

 

Across the entire UP System, UP constituent universities and members of the UP community have spoken out in protest against the unilateral termination of the UP-DND Accord.

As the UP Baguio University Council is finalizing its own statement, Chancellor Raymundo Rovillos issued a message to the UP Baguio community and the public on his Facebook page, calling the abrogation of the UP-DND agreement “very disturbing and alarming”. “Critical thinking and dissent are not synonymous to extremism/terrorism. Refusal to take these nuances into account in the current anti-insurgency drive is dangerous and counter-productive. The unbridled entry of the police and other military forces in the university would instill fear and curtail freedom, therefore threatening to destroy the very essence of a university,” Rovillos warned.

Pointing out that UP has offered assistance to police personnel and the National Bureau of Investigation with proper coordination with the UP administration, UP Los Baños (UPLB) Chancellor Jose V. Camacho, Jr. said in his statement that the Accord is not a hindrance to the enforcement of the country’s laws and judicial orders on campus. Therefore, the UPLB community views the unilateral termination of the UP-DND Accord as an assault against the freedom of UP as an institution, coming at the heels of “earlier threats to discontinue funding for the University, which was intended to silence and intimidate us”.

“We will not back down,” Camacho said. “We will continue with our duty to defend the freedom of our people guaranteed under the Constitution—the right to life and liberty, the freedom of speech, of expression and the right of the people to campaign against graft and corruption.”

UP Visayas Chancellor Clement Camposano issued a statement on the UP Visayas website denouncing the sudden termination, without consultation, of the UP-DND Agreement. “Historical events that have shaped the relationship of UP and the country’s security forces—many of these leaving wounds that have yet to heal—explain the University’s strong apprehension,” Camposano said. “While the DND has given assurances that constitutionally guaranteed rights and freedoms would not be suppressed, these historical events and the sordid reality of recent killings, abductions, and other forms of human rights abuses widely believed to have been perpetrated by security forces cannot but leave us unassured. We call on the members of the UP Visayas community to be steadfast and resolute in the defense of their democratic rights, and in ensuring that the University’s campuses remain free, safe, and welcoming towards a wide range of ideas and advocacies.”"

The COVID-19 pandemic that broke out in March last year sent schools scrambling to deliver education amid the threat of disease and the ensuing protocols to ensure public health and safety.

While some Philippine colleges and universities like UP have been employing some blended learning strategies such as, the use of virtual learning environments to complement the traditional classroom setup, the need to fully employ remote teaching and learning (RTL) have suddenly become more urgent and necessary.

Within the reality of what the World Economic Forum calls the “Fourth Industrial Revolution”—the increasing speed with which digital technologies have become more ubiquitous and mobile in today’s world—the University was already working on how to utilize these advancements and be more adaptive to the changing landscape of higher education. But COVID-19 put deployment on the fast track.

Professor Wimal Dissanayake of the Academy for Creative Media, University of Hawaii delivered the keynote address that focused on “Nationhood, Cinema and the Public Sphere”.

According to Tan, Philippine movies during the first 100 years tackled many important social issues, including politics and gender. He also said that “the best of our movies are those that had to overcome many obstacles, from budgets to censorship, showing how cinema does not just reflect society but is society writ large,” referring to censorship and films during martial law.

Tan hoped the use of digital technologies would help filmmakers in instilling critical awareness and discernment in the public. “Sineng Filipino’s excellence will depend on how we are rooted in being Filipino and in being human,” concluded Tan."
Promoting an awareness of federalism – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/promoting-an-awareness-of-federalism/,"Promoting an awareness of federalism
November 27, 2018 | Written by KIM G Quilinguing



She has spoken countless times on TV and radio as well as other media where her expertise in political science and forms of government were shared with wider and curious audiences. But Professor Maria Ela Atienza still feels that there is a lack of understanding of what federalism is and how it can affect people.

As chairperson of the Department of Political Science at the College of Social Sciences and Philosophy (CSSP) of the University of the Philippines Diliman, Atienza teaches subjects on governance, politics, local government, gender issues, and human security.

 

Prof. Maria Ela Atienza, PhD. Chairperson of the Department of Political Science, UP Diliman.

 

Atienza earned her BA in Political Science, magna cum laude, in 1992 and an MA in 1993. She joined the Department of Political Science in 1993 as an instructor. She later completed an Executive Master’s degree in International and European Relations at the University of Amsterdam in 1998 and a PhD in Political Science at Kobe University in 2003. Her papers have been published in both local and international journals, earning her the recognition of academic institutions and international organizations. In 2014, she was chosen as the Achievement Awardee for Social Sciences by the National Research Council of the Philippines.

In recent years, she has also been active not only in her teaching and research engagements but also in spreading awareness of federalism. And the number of opportunities for these discussions increased after President Rodrigo Duterte, who at that time was a candidate, swore to pursue the shift to a federal form of government.

 

Two levels of government

Asked for a simple definition of federalism, Atienza says it is a form of government where there are two levels of government: federal or national, and states or regional governments. In theory, she says federalism is the sharing of sovereignty between two levels of local government. “The idea is the federal government and state governments are equal.”

As for the current form of government in the country, she says it is unitary with some features of governance devolved or distributed to local governments: “We have the 1991 Local Government Code, so in that case, there’s a national legislation that gives powers, some powers to local government.”

As to why some countries opt for federalism, Atienza says the structure may be more ideal for those with diverse traditions and populations. “There are reasons why some nation-states opt for federalism. Some of the reasons include preservation of identities. Identities can be in terms of ethnicity, culture, religion and other differences,” she says.

 

Asst. Prof. Jan Robert Go of the Department of Political Science, UP Diliman.

 

Speaking of culture, her colleague at the department, Assistant Professor Jan Robert Go, sees federalism as a structure which would be more accommodating of the varied cultural traditions of ethno-linguistic groups in the country. “Under a federal system, you can have the Bicolanos ruled by Bicolanos in a Bicolano way, if there’s such a thing. In the same way with Calabarzon, the Tagalogs, or the Cebuanos, or the Mindanaoans.” Go believes that the form of government would reflect the local communities of the country: “I think that’s one thing positive about federalism, that we highlight the regional identities, these differences that is in our context as a Philippine society, is very apparent.”

Specializing in rapid field appraisal of local government units, money politics in elections, local citizen participation, and devolution and decentralization, Go teaches courses on Philippine politics and government, and Philippine and Asian political thought in UP Diliman. He earned his political science degree in UP Manila in 2009 and his master’s degree in Diliman in 2013.

Go thinks that federalism’s promise of empowering local communities is the biggest reason why it attracts some political leaders in the country, particularly those from areas which have been struggling to develop their provinces and towns. “The main argument of federalism is to empower the lower levels of government, particularly the regional level.” Federalism, he adds, will “let these voices, if you may, be heard.”

While federalism has been touted by advocates to spur development in the regions, Go says this will only be possible with resources also coming from the federal or national government. “We will be giving more resources to the local level, to the regional level, because they will be governing, according to how they think they should be governed.”

He warns though that this positive development could also become a negative feature of federalism. “When you give more funds, it becomes vulnerable to corruption.” While the same problem also exists in the current form of government, he said federalism might enable some unscrupulous individuals to dodge accountability. “I think federalism can exacerbate the situation and corruption may even be widespread,” he adds.

For UP National College of Public Administration and Governance (NCPAG) Dean Maria Fe Villamejor-Mendoza, federalism’s most visible attribute is its recognition of the different traditions and identities of the communities in a state. “You recognize diversity in unity.” And because of this feature, she says, the autonomy of communities is preserved.

What makes federalism different from the current form of government, according to Dean Mendoza, is that the sharing of powers is provided for by the fundamental law of the state. “The sharing of power between the central government and the states is constitutionally mandated.”

Mendoza, who teaches courses on public policy, theories of administrative systems and research methodology at NCPAG, has also been a frequent speaker on federalism over the past few years.

In barricades embattled, fighting in delirium,

Others give you their lives without doubts, without gloom.

The site nought matters: cypress, laurel or lily:

Gibbet or open field: combat or cruel martyrdom

Are equal if demanded by country and home.

The second stanza of Jose Rizal’s Mi Ultimo Adios translated above by National Artist Nick Joaquin has inspired many Filipinos to deeds both great and noble for the nation’s sake. Of all its fruits, however, perhaps none has been more firmly molded into the Filipino psyche than the Oblation.

Since its cornerstone was laid down in 1931, National Artist Guillermo Tolentino’s masterpiece has served as a rallying point for selfless action for the public interest, as well as the most recognizable and enduring symbol of the University of the Philippines (UP). Commissioned by then-UP President Rafael Palma, the Oblation is a tangible representation of Tolentino’s interpretation of two of Jose Rizal’s writing’s—Mi Ultimo Adios and A La Juventud Filipina. The statue is an elevation of sacrifice on a pedestal, indicating a “clarion call for the youth to engage in the rigors of change and progress.”

The Oblation’s unveiling during National Heroes Day introduced a figure into Philippine society rich in nationalist symbolism. The statue’s height of 3.5-meters symbolizes three and a half centuries of Spanish colonial rule, while its pose of self-offering represents Tolentino’s interpretation of Rizal’s second stanza above—in particular the “unknown heroes who fell during the night.” Furthermore, its base is a stylized representation of the Philippine archipelago, with rocks from Montalban Gorge to highlight its cultural and historical significance.

Sanchez; and Catanduanes State University president, Dr. Patrick Alain T. Azanza. Photo by Kevin Christian Roque (UP MPRO)

 

The Search for the next University of the Philippines (UP) President heated up last November 11, 2022, as the nominees for the position gathered at UP Diliman’s Cine Adarna, UPFI Film Center, to present their respective visions for UP.

All six (6) presidential hopefuls attended the event, ‘The Search: Public Forum for the Selection of the Next UP President”. The successful nominee will succeed current President Danilo L. Concepcion as the 22nd President of the University and will assume office when Concepcion steps down in February 2023.

During the event, which was also broadcast live over TVUP, each candidate had 10 minutes to present their plans and programs. After this, the event host, UP Vice President for Public Affairs (VPPA) Elena Pernia, moderated a question-and-answer session, where each candidate responded to questions from different sectors of the UP community, including real-time online queries.

Members of the UP community crowd into Cine Adarna to participate in ‘The Search: Public Forum for the Selection of the Next UP President”. The search was open to all UP community members across the System as the event was live-streamed to all UP constituent units.

To listen to the presidential hopefuls were members of the search committee, composed of the University’s Board of Regents (BOR) led by Concepcion and Commission on Higher Education (CHED) Chairman J. Prospero de Vera. The UP President, de Vera, noted in his message that he is different from most other leaders of SUCs in that they serve six years with no reappointment. De Vera described them as products of a choice that “cannot be rectified by a second term.” Moreover, the next UP President would be considered a true leader in higher education because of UP’s geographic reach and the comprehensive nature of the programs it offers.

First to the podium was Atty. Angelo A. Jimenez. Atty. Jimenez summarized his vision in six words: research power, digital transformation, and democratic access. Amidst the massive global changes brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, he stressed the need to leverage the advantages of a digital transformation within UP instead of being “nostalgic about the pre-COVID age.” Jimenez noted how the transformative powers of digital technology not only provide educational opportunities “at any time and place” but also help provide democratic access by closing the quality gap between each UP unit, as well as between UP and the SUCs of each region. Such accessibility, he said, is “true democratization.”

Next to speak was Atty. Salvador B. Belaro, Jr. At the heart of his vision was to secure a higher budget for the University to achieve its goal of becoming a truly global university. To compare, Belaro narrated his experiences at Cornell University, which he said enjoyed a budget more than 14 times that of UP. He noted that Cornell’s higher budget contributed greatly to its global status and other advantages, such as a good working environment for faculty and staff and a healthy student-to-teacher ratio. Belaro stated that in addition to integrating the good points presented by his peers, it would take fighting for a much larger share of the annual budgetary pie for UP to become truly global, “not just in talk, but in action.”

The third man up was UP Diliman Chancellor Fidel R. Nemenzo, who presented his vision statement for the chancellorship in the same venue just three years ago. Nemenzo’s vision, informed by his leadership experience in the Diliman community, was centered on three points: making an agile UP, a smart UP, and a high-impact UP. For him, being elegant meant utilizing UP’s academic research programs, such as new ones in bioinformatics, data science, and artificial intelligence, among others, to cope with disruptions. He agreed with Jimenez on the need for digital transformation, which is a key component of his idea of a smart UP. Nemenzo said that digitalization would lead to better collaboration and mobilization of resources and more efficient administrative processes. Lastly, being a high-impact university meant leveraging the diversity of critical knowledge produced across the UP system for UP to take a leadership role in issues of national importance, such as food security, health, culture, and the arts.

The fourth nominee to present his vision for the University was Prof. Benito M. Pacheco. He served as UPD Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs from 2014 to 2017. His presentation focused on 15 possibilities that he envisions for UP, all aiming to improve: democratic access and diversity at admission; enrichment courses; regional public service programs; full-time equivalent student; full-time equivalent teacher; the limited practice of a profession; grading system; student ethics code; mobility across CUs; administration; and others. “If elected as President, I would serve as a Futures Thinker-Leader for the strategic reimagining of and advocacy for our University mandate for the long term: public service and outreach; teaching; research and creative work; faculty and staff development; and democratic governance,” concluded Pacheco."

Atty. Angelo A. Jimenez started his term of office as the University of the Philippines (UP) President on February 10, 2023, in UP Diliman, Quezon City, vowing to transform UP into a “learner-centered digital university” engaged in transdisciplinary scientific, cultural, and artistic pedagogy, research, and public service.

In the turnover ceremony titled “Singkaban at Balanghai: Pasasalamat at Pagsalubong” held at the Quezon Hall Lobby, outgoing UP President Danilo L. Concepcion, who was assisted by Atty. Roberto M.J. Lara, Secretary of the University, handed over the ceremonial mace of the University President to Jimenez, symbolizing the transferring of authority over the national university. Jimenez will serve as the Chief Academic Officer, Head of the University Faculty, and Chief Executive Officer of UP for the next six years.

Concepcion and Jimenez delivered their respective valedictory and acceptance speeches in front of: family members and friends; officials of the UP System, the Board of Regents, and constituent universities; faculty, students, staff and alumni of UP; government officials and representatives of the private sector; and, international guests of UP, including a delegation of academics from Southern Taiwan and members of the Edu-Connect Southeast Asia Association Kaohsiung, Taiwan.

Jimenez accepts the presidency

In his acceptance speech, Jimenez praised Concepcion’s infrastructure accomplishments by referring to him as “Danny, the Builder” and “UP’s first Waterbender”. He also shared some of his visions for UP.

“We need to acquire a global consciousness in carrying out our mandates. . . . UP is envisioned to be at the forefront of transformative scientific, cultural and artistic pedagogy, research and public service in local and global communities. Our mission is to foster efficacy, effectivity and efficiency to transdisciplinary engagement in teaching, research and public service,” Jimenez said.

“Ang UP ay mananatiling Bulwagan ng Dangal at ipagpapatuloy natin ang simulain nito tungo sa husay at dangal,” he added.

He also posed the question, “Aanhin ang husay at dangal kung walang malasakit at kung walang pakikipagkapwa-tao?” as he proceeded to explain some of his ideas for the next six years. He calls for more transformative and collaborative research within and among UP constituent universities that will uplift the lives of the Filipino people.  Next, he aims to strengthen linkages with UP alumni who serve as the University’s partners and ambassadors to the world.

Jimenez affirmed that UP must move forward attuned to 21st century education, with digital technology and digital learning, and to critically participate in the Industrial Revolution 4.0. “We will journey towards the transformation to a learner-centered digital university,” he said.

“UP must replicate itself democratically,” Jimenez said, to be of better service to other state universities and colleges. He said UP must reach out to them and share its resources to “extend Honor and Excellence” to the towns and provinces.

He also promised to respond to the lingering issues and concerns of UP faculty and staff, to look into improving benefits, incentives, and to dialogue with the University’s unions to promote the wellbeing of UP’s faculty and employees.

Jimenez mentioned “pride of place” and “pride in people” for UP, making the campuses green spaces, safe spaces, and arts hubs.

“The hallmark of UP in the next six years will be Service to the Nation,” Jimenez said. “Service to the Nation is constitutive to who we are and what we do,” he added.

“UP will remain a bastion of academic freedom. We cannot achieve excellence without it,” he affirmed.

“UP will be strong, courageous, critical and nurturing,” concluded Jimenez.

Jimenez, the 22nd president of UP, is a renowned law practitioner specializing in labor and employment. From 1993 to 2007, he handled national interest cases at the Office of the Secretary of Labor. He served with distinction in major global hotspots where OFWs have been endangered. As Labor Attaché from 1997 to 2005, Jimenez developed overseas labor markets and delivered a broad array of critical government services. He served as Deputy Administrator of the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration from 2005 to 2007. He garnered two Presidential citations for his performance during crises in Iraq and Lebanon.

Jimenez is a published writer and an internationally recognized resource person on labor and migration.  He also served in the UP Board of Regents, UP’s highest governing body, twice, first as Student Regent in 1992 and as Regent from 2016 to 2021.

In his vision paper, Jimenez spoke of a UP that is a “global university,” and a research university focused on graduate and post-graduate programs and academic linkages. He sees UP continuing as a public service university helping government and industry while being a bastion of academic freedom. Jimenez advocates an Open Data Policy and digital transformation in learning and management. He also envisions UP helping raise the quality of undergraduate education in state universities and colleges.


Concepcion looks back with “deep pride and gratitude”

The previous UP President, Concepcion, is also a lawyer, and served as the 14th Dean of the UP College of Law before he assumed the UP Presidency in 2017. As President, he led efforts to transform UP into the University of the Future.  He steered UP through the COVID-19 pandemic, enabling the University to contribute directly to the country’s success in overcoming the public health crisis.

“Much of what we achieved happened before, throughout, and despite the pandemic, and will benefit the University long after we put that period behind us,” Concepcion said during his valedictory address.

Under Concepcion’s administration, the University instituted innovations in all its academic offerings and developed cutting-edge frontier programs. His administration succeeded in raising UP’s budget for research, securing additional faculty and staff items, increasing economic and non-economic benefits for all UP employees, and providing support and learning assistance to faculty, students, and staff.

Concepcion said, “Under my leadership, UP began crafting its academic roadmap to harness technologies that would improve the quality of UP instruction and enhance the learning journey of our students. We planned our transition toward blended learning, strategizing how online delivery systems and a broadcast television network could complement our traditional residential learning.”

From 2017 to 2022, 60 new degree programs were instituted in UP constituent universities. Academic and research programs were developed in three frontier areas: Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and the Omics sciences, leading to the creation of the Center for Intelligent Systems and the Masters and PhD programs in Data Science Analytics, Informatics, Bioinformatics, and Artificial Intelligence.

He also mentioned important initiatives pursued by UP, such as “the establishment of the UP Noah Center in 2017 as the core component of the UP Resilience Institute, a proactive hub of benchmark innovative and research-based information vital to climate change mitigation and adaptation. . . and the completion of the cycle of drug discovery and trials at the newly-established Center for Early-Stage Drug Development in UP Diliman, which complements the Institute of Herbal Medicine at UP Manila’s National Institute of Health.”"

Photo by Kevin Christian Roque (UPMPRO).

 

Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim, the 10th Prime Minister of Malaysia, called for an ASEAN that is built “on the firm foundations of a humane economy, compassion, justice, inclusiveness and shared prosperity”, in a special lecture he delivered at the University of the Philippines (UP) Theater in its Diliman campus on March 2, 2023, as part of his recent two-day visit to the Philippines.

Addressing an audience consisting of local and national government officials, representatives of the Philippine public higher education sector, members of the diplomatic corps, and UP officials, faculty, students and staff, PM Anwar delivered a lecture, “30 Years After The Asian Renaissance: Strategic Takeaways for ASEAN”. In his talk, he emphasized that “cooperation and collaboration . . . in all the crucial matters that bind us as a solid multilateral, multicultural, and diverse regional grouping must be the way forward for ASEAN.”

The prime minister elaborated on ideas of Asian Renaissance Man and the Philippines’ national hero, Dr. Jose Rizal, with references from Rizal’s “The Philippines–A Century Hence” and “On the Indolence of the Filipinos”, stating that Rizal’s words were still relevant and should provide guidance for scholars and leaders. Anwar quoted Rizal: “Justice is the foremost virtue of the civilizing races. It subdues the barbarous nations, while injustice arouses the weakest.”

In his speech, PM Anwar also called on the ASEAN to address human rights violations in junta-led Myanmar. He explained that while “decision-making by consensus continues to be a central tenet of ASEAN . . . [this] does not mean that ASEAN should remain silent over developments in member states that affect the wider region, or particularly egregious violations of the ASEAN Charter by its own members.” He said, “non-interference is not a license for indifference.”

“When I mentioned in Bangkok recently about the need to temporarily carve out Myanmar, on account of the blatant human rights violations, it was said in the larger context of the imperative to stay true to one of the key ideals of ASEAN, which is nothing less than to stand for the cause of justice and the rule of law,” he said.

‘I don’t see myself at the pinnacle.’—Cristeta Comerford – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/i-dont-see-myself-at-the-pinnacle-cristeta-comerford/,"

Even as she occupies one of the top culinary posts in the United States, White House Executive Chef Cristeta Pasia Comerford does not consider herself as being at the highest point of her life.

“I am still at a stepping stone to where life will lead me next,” she said in her speech after she was conferred a Doctor of Humane Letters, honoris causa, by the University of the Philippines on November 11 at Ang Bahay ng Alumni, UP Diliman.

 

Comerford receives the hood as another of the three vestments given to a recipient of an honorary degree. She was given the academic gown beforehand to wear to the ceremony. UP President Danilo L. Concepcion is seen here adjusting Comerford’s hood as her husband, John (in blue), and her sister, Opel Pasia Aguila (in black), look on. Also on stage are, from left, Regent Francis C. Laurel, Staff Regent Mylah R. Pedrano, Commission on Higher Education and UP Board of Regents Chairman J. Prospero E. De Vera III, Faculty Regent Ramon G. Guillermo (behind Chairman de Vera), Regent Frederick Mikhail I. Farolan (behind Comerford), Student Regent John Isaac B. Punzalan, and UP Diliman University Registrar Ma. Theresa Payongayong (Photo by Misael Bacani, UP MPRO)

 

Her appointment to the position on 05 August 2005, announced by then First Lady Laura Bush, broke “multiple glass ceilings: first minority, first Asian, first female, first Filipino”. Comerford revealed, however, that she did not immediately realize the impact of her ascendency to the post, a vacancy that took six months to fill, with 450 candidates vying for the position. She was promoted from her previous position as sous chef, which she had occupied since 1997.

Comerford marked her 14th year in the post, making her one of the longest serving White House executive chefs to date. She has acknowledged her leadership role, telling UP students, “Being a leader doesn’t mean you have made it or you are exempt from hard work. Rather, [you] should set the pace for others. As a leader, you are given much. That is when you give more back. As students, we learn much. In turn, we teach others.”

 

The last of the three vestments, the cap, is placed upon Comerford’s head by Commission on Higher Education and UP Board of Regents Chairman J. Prospero E. De Vera III (left) and UP President Danilo L. Concepcion (right). Also in this photo are, from left, Regent Francis C. Laurel, Student Regent John Isaac B. Punzalan, John Comerford, UP Diliman Chancellor Michael L. Tan (behind John Comerford), and Opel Pasia Aguila. (Photo by Misael Bacani, UP MPRO)

 

Looking at the successes of people around her, she said she sees both greatness and humility at the way they have used their gifts wisely. And so Comerford ended her address with the Filipino saying, “Ang palay ay parisan, habang nagkakalaman ay lalong nagpupugay” (translated in Damiana Eugenio’s Philippine Folk Literature: An Anthology as “Imitate the rice stalk; the more grains it bears, the lower it bows”).

30 Years After The Asian Renaissance: Strategic Takeaways for ASEAN – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/30-years-after-the-asian-renaissance-strategic-takeaways-for-asean/,"

Ladies and gentlemen,

I stand before you this morning, greatly honoured by the presence of such an august gathering of intellectual luminaries, dignitaries, and eminent leaders. I feel doubly privileged and, at the same time, deeply humbled by the conferment of this honorary doctorate by the University of the Philippines, undoubtedly an institution of higher learning of great glory and magnificence. Words escape me to express my profound and infinite gratitude. So, let me just say: Maraming salamat mula sa kaibuturan ng aking puso (Thank you very much, from the bottom of my heart.)

Ladies and gentlemen,

In 1993, ASEAN was on the cusp of major expansion, which would eventually bring in all the then independent nations in Southeast Asia. Vietnam joined in 1995, followed by Laos and Myanmar two years later. Cambodia followed suit in 1999.

ASEAN has changed dramatically in 30 years, which has led to greater achievements and opportunities even as we faced headlong our trials and tribulations. We have gone from a monolithic global order to a bipolar world to now a multipolar world.

Yet, certain things remain, or as some would venture to say: “plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose”– the more things change, the more they stay the same. That might be putting it rather cynically but let’s do a quick reality check.

Global cooperation remains essential, ancient as well as conventional trade routes must be maintained for the stability and peace of the world, and that rests on ASEAN just as much as it does China, the US, or Europe or anyone else. The COVID-19 pandemic spared none of us. Geopolitical tensions and conflicts unleash consequences well beyond borders.

For Asia in general, and particularly for ASEAN, our identities remain the same, that is, diverse and multicultural, yet united in the dignity of the nations we have carved out for ourselves in our colonial struggles and our adjustments to a globalised world. Conceptually, this was well articulated by the greatest of Malayans, Dr. José Rizal, in The Philippines a Century Hence, that this nation had gone from a scattered collection of islands, languages, cultures, and people but now is united as a Philippine Nation.[1]

Nonetheless, Dr Rizal warned against the sliding into the comfort zone of routine which “is a declivity down which many governments slide.” Indeed, as we extrapolate this in the context of ASEAN, we could make a case that routine has led, to a certain extent, to the erosion of our bonds as individual states which must be united in the common cause of peace and stability. Even worse, routine has allowed the world to fall behind our future potential. Routine tells us to be divided in opinion and to hate one another, fuelled by the convenience and routine of social media, fake news, misplaced nationalism, and certainly, Islamophobia.

The question is, what have we learned? We should not simply fear words – Communism, left, right, Muslim, Christian, Jew, capitalist, socialist, etc. No words can be cast aside if they have not been thought through.

Today, ASEAN is a larger and more integrated association. We are now a community, with three distinct pillars – political security, economic, and socio-political. The ASEAN Community, its focus and scope, is in itself, a significant achievement. Yet while being more integrated, it is an organisation that has retained its plurality and sovereignty.

The doctrine of ASEAN centrality is supposedly cast in stone. Yet, some, both inside and outside ASEAN, have questioned the effectiveness and efficiency of the regional organisation and this mantra of centrality. Criticisms particularly focus on two of its principles – decision-making by consensus, and non-interference.

These critics often miss the central point – ASEAN would not have grown or evolved without these key boundaries being in place. And lest we forget, we are now heading into a larger grouping, with the impending admission of Timor Leste as the eleventh member.

When I wrote The Asian Renaissance[2] in 1996, the East Asian region had undergone a period of transformative economic growth. The region’s average annual GDP growth for the three decades to 1996 was approximately 6.5 per cent.

These were heady days indeed. It gave Asians a spring in their step, a renewed sense of confidence in ourselves, no doubt grounded in the gritty and harsh reality of decades of hard work, frugal spending, self-reliance and a strong focus on educating our youth.

Today, decision-making by consensus continues to be a central tenet of ASEAN. This, however, does not mean that ASEAN should remain silent over developments in member states that affect the wider region, or particularly egregious violations of the ASEAN Charter by its own members. In all honesty, I believe that non-interference is not a license for indifference.

Indeed, Wittgenstein, regarded by many as the greatest philosopher of the 20th century – as far as the West is concerned – reminds us that “Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent”.[3] But that’s because words have power, greater than the destructive and hateful actions of a few. Yet, if left unwritten and unread, then we are all in a lot of trouble.

Hence, when I mentioned in Bangkok recently about the need to temporarily carve out Myanmar, on account of the blatant human rights violations, it was said in the larger context of the imperative to stay true to one of the key ideals of ASEAN, which is nothing less than to stand for the cause of justice and the rule of law.

In this regard, it bears repeating these immortal lines from Dr. Rizal, who I must reiterate, remains truly an Asian Renaissance Man, that “Justice is the foremost virtue of the civilising races. It subdues the barbarous nations, while injustice arouses the weakest.”

In the pursuit of justice, let us therefore celebrate our differences and praise our national unities. Let us look beyond our divergences and amplify our commonalities so that we can stand as cooperative partners working towards the betterment of all our people in a just and peaceful world. Hence, cooperation and collaboration across the board in all the crucial matters that bind us as a solid multilateral, multicultural, and diverse regional grouping must be the way forward for ASEAN.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Back in 1996, here in the Philippines, I spoke of the Christian poet Dante Alighieri and how in his Divine Comedy, he skilfully wove the political convulsions of the Italy of his time into a universal, and timeless drama of the human predicament. Now, even after seven centuries, the question is, are we still entrapped in selva obscura, our own hard and savage dark wood of prejudice, confusion and uncertainty, or have we freed ourselves from the stranglehold of captive geopolitics, media-influenced mindsets, and zero-sum approaches on questions of national sovereignty?

Till today, I still ask myself: in the continuum of Machiavellian machinations to Metternichian manoeuvres, where do we stand? In focussing on the minutiae are we not at risk of missing the forest for the trees?

And what exactly is this forest – this big picture that continues to elude our vision? I humbly submit that what was articulated nearly 30 years ago in The Asian Renaissance, remains valid in that we are still groping in the dark in search of the guiding ideas of civilization.

Many people received awards and adulations for their outstanding achievements. Still, very few have had the honor of having a flower named after them.

University of the Philippines (UP) Regent Nelia Teodoro Gonzalez, who passed on last June 19 at 97, is one of these individuals.

The gumamela or hibiscus flower that bears her name, Hibiscus rosa-sinensis ‘Nelia T. Gonzalez’, was the first of the “Oblation Series” of hibiscus launched by the Institute of Plant Breeding, College of Agriculture (now the College of Agriculture and Food Science), UP Los Baños, bred by Dr. Pablito M. Magdalita and Mr. Reynold B. Pimentel, as part of UP Los Baños’ contribution to the UP Centennial celebration. In the early summer of 2006, Regent Gonzalez accepted this honor during an occasion that also marked the launching of the Nelia T. Gonzalez Alumni Service Award and the Nelia Teodoro-Gonzalez Professorial Chair Grants.

In a column published in the Philippine Star on April 4, 2006, columnist Domini M. Torrevillas recalled the event: “Dr. Desiree M. Hautea, who presented the Hibiscus tribute…said the Hibiscus was named after the honoree because ‘Hibiscus is the Queen of Flowers and therefore, a fitting title to a lady who holds court wherever she goes inside and outside her house.’ The gumamela is bright orange, with prominent red-eye and yellow edges. Orange is flamboyant, energetic, and vibrant, reflecting the honoree’s strength, enthusiasm, fascination, success, and encouraging quality. Dr. Hautea said, ‘Truly, it is not the flower that honors the woman. It is the woman that lends honor to the flower and the University that developed it, with her name.'”

What’s in a name?

The life of UP Regent Nelia T. Gonzalez, or Tita Nelia, as she was fondly called by friends and colleagues, gives weight behind the name of the flower bred to honor her.

Almost eighty years after she graduated from UP, Nelia Teodoro Gonzalez has come to be known by her many titles: agriculturist, agro-industrialist, social entrepreneur, resource developer, public administrator, civil servant, UP Regent, president of the UPLB Alumni Association, vice-president of the UP Alumni Association, a host of leadership titles in numerous agribusiness corporations, organizations, and foundations, holder of a UP Doctor of Laws degree, honoris causa, one of the UPAA Lifetime Distinguished Achievements awardees named during its centennial in 2013, an icon for the Philippine agribusiness industry, and one of the University’s most outstanding alumni, a veritable pillar of the UP community.

Following the footsteps of her agriculturist father, Gonzalez earned her Bachelor of Science degree in Plant Pathology from the College of Agriculture (CA), UPLB, in 1944, marching as the only female graduate in her batch. Later, she earned her Certificate of Government Management from the UP College of Public Administration in UP Diliman in 1977.

Agriculturist, agro-industrialist, entrepreneur

After graduating from the UPCA, she served briefly as an agronomist at the Bureau of Plant Industry. She later helped the late industrialist Salvador Araneta manage the Araneta Institute of Agriculture (now the De Salle Araneta University) and the Republic Flour Mills (RFM). Finally, she served as General Manager and Vice President of RFM. She worked with a capable team to accomplish many things. National Scientist and former UP President Dr. Emil Q. Javier, in his essay first published in the Manila Bulletin on February 24, 2018, cited the lasting impacts of these achievements on the animal industry.

He writes: “Easily the most notable contribution of Tita Nelia and her team was the introduction of broiler poultry contract growing. RFM was the first integrator, providing day-old chicks, feeds, veterinary supplies, and growing technology to contract growers and buying back the birds at competitive prices. The scheme proved to be very successful, and the rest of the industry followed suit. As a result, to date, the broiler industry is one of our most productive and regionally competitive sectors in agriculture.”

Later, through the Punla sa Tao Foundation (PSFTI), which she headed, Gonzalez helped organized backyard poultry raisers into a cooperative, mobilized support from local government units, linked them with a microfinance entity (Sikap Bidani), and enrolled them with an integrator, Bounty Corporation–all done in a model small farmers contract growing scheme called Manok Mabuhay Program.

Gonzalez was also a pioneer in the local production of corn and soybean hybrid seeds with the establishment of Phil Hi-Bred, Inc. in the early 1970s. “Sourcing the original seed parent materials from Pioneer Hi-Bred Seed Company in Iowa and mobilizing local expertise,” Dr. Javier writes, “she established hybrid seed production operations in South Cotabato, in a 40-hectare farm in Naujan Oriental Mindoro and a 1,000-hectare farm in Bansud, also in Oriental Mindoro.”

After working for the RFM group, Gonzalez established ventures into real estate development, commercial fishing, and corn hybrid seed production. In 1980, she was named Assistant Minister of Agriculture by President Ferdinand Marcos. She played a vital role in the banner agriculture programs of the time—Masagana 99, Masaganang Maisan, Pagkain Bayan at Gulayan sa Kalusugan, and Bakahang Barangay. In addition, she supported area marketing cooperatives and credit and farm insurance.

Throughout her illustrious career as an agro-industrialist, she established a pest control management business, a livestock and poultry magazine, and an agribusiness company. In addition, she served in the Manila Overseas Press Club board and introduced contract growing in the Philippines to enhance the partnership between the feed miller and the poultry raiser to assure an equitable sharing of profit in the animal industry. She also served at the helm of various real estate and agro-industrial businesses and rural communities.

MORE THAN A SCHOOL, MORE THAN A HOSPITAL

Speech by President Danilo L. Concepcion

Commencement Exercises, UP Manila

21 June 2017

 

Esteemed members of our Board of Regents, the members of my executive team, Chancellor Menchit Padilla and the members of her administration, the faculty and staff of UP Manila, Director Gap Legaspi and the staff of the Philippine General Hospital, and the faculty and staff of our health science units in Palo, Baler, and Koronadal. But most of all let me greet and salute the graduates, their parents, and their families. Mabuhay po kayong lahat!

I know that it has taken you much time, effort, and some expense to get to this high point of your lives, on the verge of your future careers. I guess that is true for any college graduate. But for a UP graduate, expectations run even higher. And they should, because from the very start, we have been held to a higher standard of honor, excellence, and public service.

In the words of President Rafael Palma at his investiture in 1925, it was UP’s mission not just to produce graduates, but to encourage “original thinking and (assert) our individuality in the realm of mind (for) the positive benefit of the Filipino people.”

A UP graduate has to be a willing, creative, and audacious agent of social transformation, going above and beyond the normal call of duty to find ways of uplifting the lives of our countrymen.

Thankfully, in UP Manila, you have had more than a century of exemplary experience in conjoining higher education with public service. That’s largely because of the unique relationship between UP Manila’s role and offerings as a traditional university and its health sciences component bannered by the Philippine General Hospital.

Up until today, especially during budget season, some lawmakers still have a problem understanding that relationship, insisting that PGH should be taken out of UP Manila. What we must make clear to them is that practically from the beginning, UP Manila—or indeed just UP as it was then—was always more than a school, and PGH was always more than a hospital.

Few will recall that UP partly owes its existence to the Philippine Medical School, which was incorporated into UP in 1909. Within a year, it was considered at par with some of the better American medical schools. President William Howard Taft had wanted to put the School under the Department of Sanitation, but Dean Worcester—whatever else we may think about him—believed so strongly in the school’s educational mission that he pushed for the creation of a hospital to serve the training needs of the school. And thus was PGH born.

PGH, of course, became the biggest and most modern Asian hospital of its time, and even a century later, it occupies pride of place as the hospital most Filipinos still think of when they require medical attention. In other words, it is the hospital closest to the Filipino heart. But even as it serves about 600,000 patients every year, many of them our poorest citizens, it has never forgotten its educational mission.

This is why UP Manila has produced world-class doctors, world-class dentists, nurses, pharmacists, and so on.

UP Manila exemplifies what a 21st century university should be: an institution with a special strength in a highly competitive and absolutely vital field, anchored on solid humanistic values and principles, and open to a diverse array of talents and interests.

This brings me to a personal confession I have to make: When I was a school boy, I wanted to become a doctor. A surgeon, actually. Sadly, my dream was frustrated by life’s circumstances. My father was a bus driver, and my mother struggled to raise seven of us on our father’s income. I myself was a working student, and half of what I earned went to helping put my three younger siblings through school. So when I applied for a college scholarship with the National Science Development Board, I had to pick from a list of approved science courses. This list did not include medicine, and I needed to work to support myself and my siblings. So I chose agricultural engineering in a school I could easily commute to, and only later did I take up law at UP.

I tell you this story not only because being with you today in a sense fulfills a childhood dream, but also to show that as significant as your graduation today is, you may never know for sure what your future will be until you get there.

I recently came across a quote by the American author Nancy Levin: “Honor the space between ‘no longer’ and ‘not yet.’”

This seems like a good description of where you are right now. Right here, right now, you are at a crossroads. This ceremony officially marks the end of your lives as college students of UP Manila, and you stand on the verge of becoming something and someone else: doctors, teachers, NGO workers, call-center agents, entrepreneurs, managers, performers, even politicians.

That transition will be quicker and easier for some but not for others. But I can tell you now that this transition will never be complete, and rightly so, because you will always be UP students for the rest of your lives.

You will forever be inquisitive, independent, assertive, ever ready to turn challenge into opportunity.

These hallmarks of a UP education you will bear with you whatever career path you may choose, and wherever those paths may lead you. That education will be the anchor from which you can pivot into anything you want to be.

In my case, it was UP and the College of Law that allowed me to realize my life’s mission, that is to learn and to use the law for public service, and later to produce more outstanding lawyers in the grand manner, as we like to say in the college. More recently, that mission has become even more complex, as I now have to deal not only with a college, not even just a university, but an entire university system.

I have to admit that it’s a daunting responsibility, especially in an environment increasingly characterized by vicious political polarization. But precisely because many people—even respectable academics—no longer seem able to speak to one another in the language of civility. I find it even more vital to recreate the University as a special space, a common ground, within which we can all work together.

My executive staff and I have been preparing the Strategic Plan that will guide my administration over the next six years. Because it requires extensive deliberation and consultation, it remains a work in progress, the details of which we will be sharing with you before too long. But I can tell you now that we will seek to create an enabling environment within which we can perform as a University at our full potential.

If there is anything I firmly believe in, it is in the value of productive labor—whether that labor takes place in the classroom, the laboratory, the boardroom, the community, or the global arena. We have to find ways in which to work, and work together, despite and away from the growing toxicity of both national and campus politics.

I do not mean to suggest that we will stop having or expressing opinions. Debate and dissent are as much a part of UP tradition as the Oblation and the Lantern Parade. But I surmise that at the end of the day, nothing achieves more than concrete action. Why, talk and analyze our problems to death, when our time might be spent seeking workable and consensual solutions.

I have many plans for UP that I believe will occupy us in very productive ways. Again, the details will still have to be worked out, but we are studying the possibility of opening a new medical complex in Diliman. This medical complex shall be an extension of PGH, will serve not only the needs of our northern metropolitan population but also push the frontiers of medical practice and research.

There will be resistance, for sure, UP being UP. You might be interested to know that in 1937, when President Quezon pushed for the transfer of UP from Padre Faura to Diliman, UP students led by a young editor named Armando Malay held a straw vote, that rejected the move by 84%. Then President Bienvenido Gonzalez was roundly vilified. Twelve years later, when the move had happened, Malay spoke again in UP Diliman, and acknowledged that it was time “for a closing of the ranks.”

No one will argue now that moving the main campus to Diliman was a mistake. But it would also be grossly mistaken to say that Manila was abandoned and left behind. It’s true that it became a smaller campus by comparison, but it soon developed its own appeal and its own ethos as a university geared for the urban student. And of course there was always the PGH and the health sciences cluster, whose academic requirements made sure that UP Manila would grow well into another century."

The University of the Philippines Diliman community was up early on Sunday, July 26, 2020, to witness the very first virtual commencement exercises in the constituent university’s (CU) history. The event, formally titled “109th Pangkalahatang Pagtatapos”, was live streamed via UP Diliman’s official website at 7:00 AM in the morning, reaching the homes of its 3,789 graduates and their families. Replay can be viewed at the UP Diliman YouTube channel.

The UP Diliman Class of 2020 was led by 28 summa cum laudes, who graduated with a weighted average grade (WAG) of 1.20 or higher. Alongside them were 302 who earned magna cum laudes (WAG 1.40 or higher), and 683 cum laudes (WAG 1.75 or higher). Those who attended virtually got to know UP Diliman’s summa cum laude graduates better, as the program  included their observations and reflections on their achievements amidst the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Maglingkod, Magmalasakit, Maningidgan” was the theme of Diliman’s 109th commencement exercises. With this theme the graduating class was called upon to “serve the country with empathy and conviction so that excellence, rights, and justice might prevail”. Of the students who were conferred their degrees, 2,892 received baccalaureate degrees, while 897 received either diploma, master’s, or doctoral degrees.

This year’s commencement speaker was none other than former UP Diliman Chancellor and UP Professor Emeritus for Anthropology. Michael Lim Tan. The focus of his graduation speech concerned what he called the “art of accompaniment”, which he said he imbibed from Pope Francis’s 2013 apostolic exhortation, Evangelii Gaudium. It was described, Tan said, as the respect that involves “removing our sandals before the sacred ground of the Other”.

Protocols carried out as 2 UP faculty members undergo test for COVID-19 – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/protocols-carried-out-as-2-up-faculty-members-undergo-test-for-covid-19/#,"

Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) Advice for the UP Community

as of 14 February 2020

 

On December 31, 2019, an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus or novel coronavirus disease, previously called 2019-nCoV, was first reported from Wuhan, China, and has since spread across the globe. Coronaviruses belong to a large family of viruses found in both animals and humans. Some of these viruses cause illnesses that include both the common cold and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

With over 20,000 cases reported across 24 countries, including the Philippines, it is important to know what we must do to prevent an infection. For us in the UP community, the University has a set of protocols if we or someone we know contract what the World Health Organization has named the COVID-19 acute respiratory disease.

 

Positive for exposure

If you have traveled to China, Macau, Hong Kong or other areas with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, or if you have had close contact (within one meter) with a confirmed case of COVID-19 infection, you should stay at home and monitor yourself for symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath, for 14 days from the date of arrival or exposure. While current data show that people who have symptoms contribute most to the spread of the disease, it may also be possible that people infected with COVID-19 may be infectious before they even show any symptoms.

If you have come into close contact with a confirmed case, or you have been exposed to potential infection during your travels, please seek consultation with the University Health Service on campus, or at the nearest health facility, and undergo a health assessment before resuming your daily routine.

At this point, you will be considered a Person Under Monitoring (PUM), and you will be advised to go on self-quarantine for 14 days. Here are some home quarantine instructions for PUMs:

Stay at home except when getting medical care.
Separate yourself from the other people in your home.
Avoid sharing household items.
Wash your hands frequently with soap and water and sanitize with alcohol.
Cover your cough and sneezes with tissue.
Wear a face mask with the colored side facing outward.
Monitor your symptoms.
Call ahead before visiting your doctor.

 

Positive for symptoms

If you have been exposed to COVID-19 through your travels or through close contact with a confirmed case, and you are showing respiratory symptoms, here is what you should do:

Seek consultation with your University Health Service on campus or go to the nearest health facility. Once there, you will be asked to fill out a form that will include questions about your travel history and/or if you have come into contact with a confirmed case. Make sure you wear your face mask properly and call ahead.
You will be brought to a holding area where the physician on duty will more closely investigate the timing of your symptoms. At this point, you will be designated as Patient Under Investigation (PUI).
The physician will inform the City Epidemiology Surveillance Unit (CESU) or the Municipal Epidemiology Surveillance Unit (MESU), and will continue to coordinate with the CESU/MESU in monitoring your condition, which will include admitting you to specialized hospitals with the capacity to treat the disease.

 

Preventive measures

When it comes to good health, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. For the members of the UP community who have not recently traveled to China, Macau, Hong Kong or come into close contact with a confirmed case, follow these infectious respiratory disease-prevention rules from the Department of Health and World Health Organization:

OBSERVE PROPER HAND HYGIENE. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds (or two rounds of “Happy Birthday”), and, if available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
REMEMBER THAT YOUR FACE IS SACRED. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Your hands may have touched contaminated surfaces, and you can transfer germs from the surface to yourself.
RESPECT PERSONAL SPACE. Avoid crowded places and maintain at least a one-meter or three-foot distance between yourself and other people, particularly those who are coughing, sneezing and have a fever.
PRACTICE GOOD COUGH ETIQUETTE. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze and properly and immediately dispose of the tissue. Wash your hands properly afterward. (Refer to Item No. 1.) You may be asked to wear a face mask to protect others.
WEAR THE FACE MASK PROPERLY. Wear the face mask with the colored side facing outward, fully covering the nose, mouth, and chin. Never touch the mask with your hands. Remove the mask by holding only the strings. Properly dispose of the mask. Wear a face mask only when necessary, such as if you are immunocompromised or have a cough and cold.
AVOID EATING RAW OR IMPROPERLY COOKED ANIMAL PRODUCTS, as COVID-19 is also animal-transmitted.
WASH YOUR HANDS WITH SOAP AND WATER AFTER CONTACT WITH PETS. Although there is no evidence yet that pets can be infected with COVID-19, this will help prevent the spread of other germs such as E. coli and Salmonella. Also, wash your hands with soap and water after visiting an animal market or wet market, and avoid unprotected contact with wild or farm animals.
WASH YOUR HANDS AFTER HANDLING THINGS SUCH AS DOOR KNOBS AND TABLE TOPS. Although coronaviruses do not survive long on objects such as letters and packages, they have been detected on places like door knobs, table tops or other surfaces.
KEEP YOUR GADGETS AND PERSONAL ITEMS CLEAN. Disinfect your mobile phones, tablets, laptops, bags, eyeglasses, etc. regularly.
GET YOUR INFORMATION ONLY FROM THE PROPER AUTHORITIES to prevent the spread of fake news and disinformation. Proper health authorities include your University Health Service on campus, the Department of Health and its city and regional offices, and the WHO.
BOOST YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM by eating a balanced diet, getting enough sleep and exercise, and drinking plenty of water. A strong immune system will be better able to fight off COVID-19, as well as other diseases.

 

Know who to ask

To prevent the spread of misinformation and undue alarm, it is important that we get our information only from the proper authorities.

For questions and concerns, please contact the Public Health Unit of the University Health Service on campus or in the health facility near you.

March 20, 2020

 

Dear members of the UP community:

 

I would like to express my sincere gratitude and appreciation to you all for your amazing response to this crisis—a global situation the likes of which we have not seen in our lifetimes. We have been forced to suspend classes, work and all other campus activities, and to stay inside our homes and practice social distancing, all to contain the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) and to keep our healthcare system from being dangerously overwhelmed. For some of us, the effects of these measures on our finances, work, and social lives, and on our mental and physical health, have been devastating.

 

Yet, I have seen UP rise magnificently to the challenge. Every constituent unit, every sector, and every member of the UP community has demonstrated and continues to demonstrate incredible courage, resourcefulness, intelligence, selflessness, and compassion. Our scientists have used their knowledge to help their fellow Filipinos. Our medical and health practitioners, including our interns, are serving heroically at the frontlines of this war. Our faculty are exploring new ways and alternative platforms to fulfill their mission to teach, no matter the circumstances.

 

Our skeleton staff are working to keep our University running and to protect our communities. Our administrative officials have been tirelessly steering the University through rough waters. And our students, alumni and campus residents are doing their part by using their training to build sanitation tents for public use, or by donating food and supplies to fellow members of the UP community in need, or by campaigning for support for our doctors, nurses and health centers, or by simply doing what they can to educate, to ease people’s burdens, and uplift their spirits.

March 20, 2020

 

Dear members of the UP community:

 

As you all know, our national government has placed all of Luzon under enhanced community quarantine. Regions south of Luzon are also undergoing similar safety measures within their localities. All of these is part of our government’s effort to contain the spread of the COVID-19 disease.

 

In light of these developments, the UP System has suspended all classes, both residential and online, as well as alternative learning activities, across all constituent units until April 14, 2020, with the UP Open University as the only exception. A new schedule for online classes will be announced in an upcoming Memorandum.

UP faces a P22.295B budget cut for FY 2023 – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/up-faces-a-p22-295b-budget-cut-for-fy-2023/,"UP faces a P22.295B budget cut for FY 2023
August 31, 2022 | Written by Celeste Ann Castillo Llaneta



The University of the Philippines (UP), which includes the UP Philippine General Hospital (UP-PGH), is facing a potential budget cut of P22.295 billion, or nearly half of its proposed budget for the Fiscal Year (FY) 2023. The national government allotted a total budget of P21.854B instead of the P44.149B the University originally proposed. The total of P21.854B is net of the Retirement and Life Insurance Premium (RLIP) in the amount of P1.253B.

Most of the reductions in the UP budget were made in the allotment for capital outlay (CO) and equipment outlay (EO), impacting many of the University’s infrastructure projects for the next year.

Under the National Expenditure Program (NEP) 2023 submitted by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) on August 22 to Congress, UP is provided a total budget that is a little less than half of what it needs, broken down as follows:

Personnel Services (PS)                                                                 P 14,226,520,000

Maintenance and Other Operating Exp (MOOE)                                 7,602,067,000

The University of the Philippines (UP), through the UP Alumni Association (UPAA), honored this year’s Distinguished Alumni Awardees on November 11 at the Luciano E. Salazar Hall, Ang Bahay ng Alumni in UP Diliman, Quezon City.

The Distinguished Alumni Awardees present during the ceremonies were headed by Albay Representative Edcel C. Lagman (AB, 1962 cum laude; Bachelor of Laws, 1966), who was named the UPAA Most Distinguished Alumnus for 2022. The roster of awardees includes eminent scientists and academics; leaders in business, finance, and entrepreneurship; healthcare and law practitioners; public servants and diplomats; and lifelong socio-civic advocates, among others.

The event also paid tribute to Ms. Daisy Magalit-Rodriguez (Graduate in Nursing, 1965; BS in Nursing, 1969; Master of Nursing, 1971), the UPAA Distinguished Service Awardee for an Alumna, and a past president of the UPAA in America. She passed away on October 24. She was represented in the awarding ceremony by her nephew Pedro N. Magalit.

“Critical thinking is the hallmark of UP.”

Speaking on behalf of the awardees, Lagman said: “Recognition is not sought; it is deservedly bestowed. We do not work to be recognized but must ensure our work is meritorious.”

“I am certain all of the awardees excelled in their chosen fields not to be cited, but to give back to and honor UP for giving us quality education and imparting in us the fidelity to patriotism and passion for freedom,” Lagman said.

“Much of my enduring advocacies and steadfast commitments were honed here in UP. My UP education taught me the option to conform but, more instructively, the right to reasonably differ. Indeed, critical thinking is the hallmark of UP,” emphasized Lagman. He connected this to his decades-long political career as an Opposition member and a fiscalizer.

The distinguished lawmaker further explained, “The right to dissent is integral to a free society and is at the heart of democracy. It encompasses our individual and collective rights to freedom of expression, association, assembly, and nation-building participation. Dissent encourages debate. It is vital in making informed decisions on issues of public concern.”

Lagman ascertained, “Verily, dissent can prevail.”

He added, “The freedom of expression is abused today by the proliferation of excessive misinformation, which malevolently manipulates public opinion and even electoral will. Consequently, let us all be sentinels of truth and verities against the purveyors of lies and false news. It is also incumbent on UP to start extensively teaching—if it has not yet started—media or news literacy so that our youth can readily discern truth from falsehood.”

“Finally, on behalf of the awardees, I call on all Filipinos to courageously fight for and enjoy the freedom and exercise the right of expression and dissent, fearless of prior restraint or subsequent reprisal,” concluded Lagman.

The UPAA awardees for 2022 include:

Three Generations: Agustin Family, Alentajan Family, Reyes Family, Rojas-Aleta Family, Rola-Bustrillos Family, Tejano Family, and Yap-Rodriguez Family.

Faculty and employees of the University of the Philippines (UP) are duly unionized and represented by the All UP Academic Employees Union (AUPAEU) and the All UP Workers Union (AUPWU), respectively, in collective negotiations with the UP administration, and in a multitude of activities inside and outside the UP constituent university (CU) chapters and the whole UP System.

Although distinct and separate organizations on both the university and system-wide levels, the two unions share common principles and roots, are identical in their advocacies for the UP constituency and the Filipino people’s rights and welfare, and have been in close coordination since their inception.

According to Dr. Gene Nisperos, president of the AUPAEU-UP Manila Chapter, the union adheres to the World Health Organization (WHO) definition of health as “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” He explains that the overall health and wellness of all UP constituents are important aspects of union work.

Jossel Ebesate, National PRO of the AUPWU and former Staff Regent of UP, said the union “views its advocacy of employees’ welfare from a holistic perspective, not only for UP employees, but for the Filipino people in general.” This view is explicit in the constitution and bylaws and the Collective Negotiation Agreement (CNA), in provisions such as “We fully realize that our effort to enhance the quality of our life forms part of the general movement to achieve a just and democratic social order, and a better standard of living. We affirm our responsibility to contribute to the unity and well-being of all Filipino workers and other disadvantaged members of Philippine society.”

To ensure the promotion of employees’ rights, welfare and privileges, further specified in the CNA are the union’s committees on Organization and Credentials; Public Affairs; Research and Education; Finance; Grievance and Negotiations; Gender; and, Health and Safety.

Professor Emmanuel Dumlao, president of the AUPAEU-UP Los Baños Chapter, emphasizes that “The AUPAEU’s reason for being rests primarily on its mandate to protect and promote the overall wellness of all faculty and REPS in UP by securing ‘the most just and reasonable terms of employment’ in the University, as stated in Art. II, Sec. 1 of its constitution and by-laws.”

Dumlao adds, “Being an MPMU or militante, progresibo, at makabayang unyon, AUPAEU believes that this ‘effort to enhance the quality of our life’ in the University can’t be detached from the Filipino peoples’ struggles towards building a ‘just and democratic social order.’ In short, AUPAEU means paglilingkod sa sarili at sa sambayanan.”

The University’s health sciences center

Nisperos highlighted the role of UP Manila’s Union in efforts to obtain more benefits as a way of improving the well-being of Union members nationwide, since UP Manila is UP’s Health Sciences Center and is home to the Philippine General Hospital (PGH), the largest government hospital in the country that is administered by UP. He said it is important to keep people healthy, not just by making health services available and accessible, but also by encouraging the maintenance of “good health.”

Ebesate recalls that in 1999, “The union’s Manila Chapter successfully lobbied for all UP Manila employees (except PGH that has already implemented it since 1997) being entitled to all the benefits under the Magna Carta for Public Health Workers (RA 7305). In 2001, the union was again successful in lobbying for the full implementation of almost all monetary benefits under the said law, such as hazard pay and subsistence allowance. It was later adopted in all Health Service Units of the University.”

“In 2007, during the negotiation of the CNA of both sectors, the AUPWU, in coordination with the AUPAEU, launched a campaign for the University to provide health care assistance to employees especially those admitted in hospitals. The UP Administration responded with the Financial Assistance Program for Hospitalization Expenses (FAPHE),” he adds.

The Union is also working for the institutionalization of Health and Safety Committees at the CU and System levels.

“We promote wellness for our members. There are different groups in UP that conduct activities we support, such as zumba and yoga sessions, and sports. Last year, we held the Union Cup, a one-day event to foster camaraderie among AUPAEU members,” says Nisperos. He said UP Manila faculty and REPS, of all ages, participated in the friendly competitions in bowling and darts held at a nearby mall’s bowling complex. “This year we intend to have our Laro ng Lahing Pilipino,” he added, referring to the sports festival featuring Filipino games for union members and their families.

Nisperos also revealed their efforts to increase the kind of laboratory tests included in the annual physical exams as the employee gets older, as well as having the elderly members’ yearly executive check-up and their needed medical treatment to be covered by UP as part of the implementation of the Magna Carta of Public Health Workers. He also hopes that the PGH can be the central hospital for all the constituent units of UP, so that UP faculty and employees from any UP campus can avail themselves of PGH services.

In 2016, the UP Board of Regents (BOR) approved the Enhanced Hospitalization Programme (eHOPE) for the Faculty, REPS and Administrative Staff https://www.up.edu.ph/index.php/up-enhances-hospitalization-benefits-for-employees/. Nisperos says the union aims to conduct more information campaigns about eHOPE, to expand its coverage, and to have UP’s contractuals included as well.

The University of the Philippines Diliman, through the Office for Initiatives in Culture and the Arts (OICA), College of Arts and Letters (CAL) and the Asian Center (AC), is hosting the Joint 2018 International Federation for Theatre Research Conference and Asian Theatre Working Group Colloquium 2018 (IFTR-Asia 2018) with the theme Bodies in/and Asian Theaters from 20 to 23 February 2018.

A growing interest on the body as a starting point of discourse is seen in the past decades. Even theatre studies has been involved on scrutinizing the body as an important performance aspect. In Western theatre practice, physical theatre is a well-articulated practical approach for understanding the body vis-à-vis theatre and performance. However, the increasing number of the most influential theorizations and conceptualizations has primarily, if not exclusively, focused on how the cultures in the West (Europe and the Americas) conceive it.

Picture UP Diliman and, aside from the Oblation, what comes to mind is its greenery—the lagoon park and acacia lanes. Many memories, often pleasant, have been formed under the trees, on the grass, at the tete-a-tete benches, and on the asphalted avenue, often rained over by small leaves and fruits of the raintrees or by yellow narra blooms. One would picture Zorro, the masked and caped sentinel giving joggers high-fives. Or perhaps, the SBs standing guard on the well maintained grounds.

Invisible and unheard of to many is Seven Gie Acuzar,  a frail-looking man better known by his colleagues in UP as “Bay” because of his Visayan accent. He has been keeping the area clean for a long time. 

“I started working in UP in August 2004,” he says in Filipino. “I was just 21, a high school graduate, and single. My brother,  who was agency-hired to work here, convinced me to apply here.”

Maintaining the UP grounds was a far cry from welding and handling cereals and nuts in factories in the Camanava area, where he had been a contractual worker. It was not difficult to move to UP despite similar contractual terms, as UP was nearer his place in Bgy. Pansol.

A worker for the Campus Maintenance Office, he has covered the side of the lagoon south of the creek, AS Parking, and the one-kilometer stretch of Roxas Avenue from the main administration building to Vinzons Hall, where the tree-canopied road is most often photographed.

Using tongs and a broom, and pushing a kartilya along, it takes him more than a day to pick up litter and sweep Roxas avenue clean.  “You need to first pick up plastic, paper and other kinds of litter thrown by people. These are the first to be noticed by the joggers. Then you begin sweeping. There used to be trash receptacles around the Oval, which I was also tasked to empty. You do these the whole day for one kilometer, moving from Administration to Vinzons, and then back. You won’t finish on the same day,” he continues.

At the lagoon, where he was assigned for more than 10 years, routine maintenance takes more than a week. “I was caretaker of the lagoon until I was assigned to only cover Roxas in 2015. My job covered the area bordered by the canal and Roces Avenue. Just picking up the puti [manmade garbage such as plastic and paper] took one day. The area required more than a week to clean.”

These areas Bay has been assigned to remain the cleanest on campus, attracting a regular crowd, including bird-watchers.

Asked about the beauty and significance of his workplace, he readily talks about wildlife. “Birds thrive here. They find food. Cranes, native doves, kingfishers, migratory birds coming here from October to March.”

On the eve of the investiture of University of the Philippines (UP) President Angelo “Jijil” A. Jimenez at the UP Mindanao Atrium, a historic consultation meeting with Bangsamoro Transition Authority officials and stakeholders was held at the Dusit Thani Residences in Davao City on September 13. Representatives from the UP System and constituent units, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) government, and State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) in BARMM discussed opportunities for collaboration, with the goal of improving the socio-economic conditions of the Bangsamoro region and Mindanao in general.

UP Mindanao Chancellor Lyre Anni E. Murao said the event was an affirmation of the academic leaders’ desire to help Mindanaoans. She added that UP is eager to cooperate and harmonize its efforts with partner SUCs, primarily the Mindanao State University System (MSU).

UP Pres. Jimenez, a Manobo and Mindanaoan himself, explained that while Mindanao is rich in natural and human resources, the regions’ development was severely stifled due to deeply-rooted problems that cause poverty, underdevelopment, and social conflicts.

“I realized, so many years ago, that the people of Mindanao likewise deserve to experience the same fruits of development and peace that more progressive provinces of our archipelago were already enjoying,” Jimenez emphasized, and said further that he hoped UP could actively serve as catalyst and enabler for social transformation.

Jimenez called on all stakeholders to “seize the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to partner now with the national University, while it is being led by one of us, and allow one another to help sustain Mindanao’s overall progress,” in accordance with the University’s mandate under Republic Act 9500, which is to lead in the nation’s higher education and public service spheres.

“The University of the Philippines is eager to support the development of educational institutions within the Bangsamoro region. By providing technical assistance, faculty exchanges, and curriculum development support, we aim to empower the youth with quality education, fostering a knowledge-based society,” Jimenez said.

For Jimenez, the meeting is “a significant milestone towards making quality education and basic services accessible even to the poorest and marginalized sectors, and enhancing inclusive development in the country today.”

“We are pursuing the dream of building a future where every individual in the Bangsamoro region has access to quality education, economic opportunities, and an enabling environment in which to thrive,” he emphasized.

For the unions safeguarding the well-being of the University of the Philippines’ faculty, research, extension and professional staff (REPS), and administrative staff, the year 2021 ends with wins and milestones for the concerned sectors of the University.

Grant of CNA Incentive

The two unions—the All UP Academic Employees Union (AUPAEU) and the All UP Workers Union (AUPWU)—with the help of all the faculty, REPS, and administrative staff across the UP System, have successfully signed an agreement with the UP administration for the grant of Collective Negotiation Agreement (CNA) Incentive amounting to P25,000.00, which the UP Board of Regents has approved through a referendum conducted on December 17 to 21, 2021.

Memorandum No. NGY 21-184, released by the UP Office of the Vice President for Administration (OVPA) on December 22, details the guidelines on the grant of the CNA Incentive for the Fiscal Year 2021.

According to the memorandum, those covered by the agreement are:

I know you are here not to fight for me but to fight for UP. You are here for academic freedom, democratic governance, and for the voice of the community to be heard in important decisions of the BOR],” Nemenzo said.

“Inaasahan ko ang inyong pakikilahok at pagkakaisa sa mga darating na hamon at pagsubok na sama-sama nating haharapin. Taus-pusong pasasalamat sa inyong lahat! Mabuhay ang UP! [I look forward to your participation and unity amid the challenges we will all meet head on. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Long live UP!]” he added.

In his vision paper presented during the chancellorship selection process, Nemenzo declared that he would re-imagine UP Diliman as a “modern research university with a public mission”, and an “academic center of excellence” that is inclusive, diverse, inter-disciplinary and public service-oriented. He pledged to continue to cultivate UP Diliman’s spirit of critical inquiry and academic excellence “guided by a strong moral compass”. He is committed to safeguarding academic freedom in UP Diliman. He has also vowed to be guided by the principles of democratic governance, administrative and operational efficiency, and sustainability and resiliency."
A “house of peace” in UP: UP President Jose V. Abueva’s legacy – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/a-house-of-peace-in-up-up-president-jose-v-abuevas-legacy/,"A “house of peace” in UP: UP President Jose V. Abueva’s legacy
August 18, 2021 | Written by Celeste Ann Castillo Llaneta



The story of the man that Dr. Jose Veloso Abueva would become—political scientist and public administration scholar, founder, and President of Kalayaan College, and Professor Emeritus and 16th President of the University of the Philippines—began with the story of a boy who survived an untold tragedy and went on to live his life advocating for peace.

Overcoming tragedy

The story is recounted in One by One (2004) by Daisaku Ikeda, Japanese Buddhist philosopher, educator, peace advocate, and honorary President of Soka Gakkai and founding President of the Soka Gakkai International. The book is a collection of essays. Ikeda reflects on his encounters with various world figures, scholars, and activists who have inspired him. The article, “Refusing to Hate”, tells of Dr. Abueva, then a teenaged boy during the last year of the Japanese occupation of the country in World War II. Their parents, Teodoro and Nena, known resistance fighters, were tortured and taken away from their children. While his brother Napoleon “Billy” stayed to look after their five other siblings, Jose, together with a cousin, set out in a boat to search for his parents. Eventually, he came upon the torn and bloodied remnants of their clothing near a hill, where Filipino resistance fighters had been reportedly executed. There, he gathered their remains and made the sad journey back to his orphaned siblings.

Others may have been consumed with anger and hate over the tragedy that had befallen their family. On the other hand, Dr. Abueva and his siblings rose above it, striving to support one another. In time, each Abueva sibling attained success and made their marks locally and internationally. For instance, his brother Napoleon became National Artist for Sculpture. Dr. Abueva excelled in the areas of education, development, and peace studies.

Rising from the ranks

Born on May 25, 1928, Abueva earned his Bachelor of Arts degree (Arts-Law), cum laude, from UP in 1951, his Master of Public Administration in 1954 and his Ph.D. in Political Science (minor in Sociology) in 1959 from the University of Michigan. He earned his UP Graduate Study Fellowships from the US Mutual Security Agency/Foreign Operations Administration, forerunners of USAID, the Agricultural Development Council, and the Rockefeller Foundation.

From 1950 to 1970, he crossed ranks from being graduate assistant and Instructor in Political Science and Sociology at the UP Diliman College of Liberal Arts to becoming Professor of Public Administration, serving as Assistant Dean for Academic Instruction and Research from 1963 to 1970 of the then UP College of Public Administration (UP CPA). He was founding editor of the UP CPA’s Philippine Journal of Public Administration, assisted UP President Carlos P. Romulo in the reorganization of UP as Faculty Coordinator, and became the first President of the UP Faculty Association and, later, Director of Local Government Research of the UP CPA. In the mid-1960s, he pioneered development-related studies in the University. He also established the Doctor of Public Administration Program at the UP CPA.

He also served in various government posts, including as Executive Director of the Joint Executive-Legislative Local Government Reform Commission from 1970 to 1971; as Secretary of the Constitutional Convention (elected by the Convention Delegates) from 1971-1973; and as Executive Secretary of the Metro Manila Councilors’ Assembly in 1973.

Service to the UNU

In a curious twist, he was recruited in 1977 by the United Nations University (UNU) in Tokyo, Japan. He served from 1977 to 1987. His work with the UN also included as Secretary of the UN University Council (Governing Board of the University), as Director of the UN University Office for North America, UN Headquarters in New York City, and Director of Planning and Evaluation for the UN University. As Ikeda shares in his essay:

“At the UNU, Dr. Abueva worked with a team of talented, dedicated, and multicultural scholars to advance UNU’s mission of coordinating research on such global issues as eliminating hunger, managing natural resources, and promoting social development. Throughout their stay in Japan, Dr. Abueva and his family made a conscious effort to make friends and be ambassadors of goodwill, learning the Japanese language and culture. ‘By living, learning and working in Japan, by fate or accident, we’d like to feel that we helped to achieve on a limited scale a reconciliation between Filipinos and Japanese,’ [Abueva writes].”

Socialized tuition and a Filipino language policy

Equitable development, nationalism, and peace became the hallmarks of Abueva’s administration when he became President of the University of the Philippines from 1987 to 1993, serving concurrently as Chancellor of UP Diliman from 1990 to 1991. Following the observation that enrollment in UP was declining among students from marginalized communities, he introduced the Socialized Tuition Fee Assistance Program (STFAP) in 1987. The program bracketed UP students and ensured that wealthy students paid higher tuition to subsidize more underprivileged scholars. He also institutionalized a Filipino language policy within the University, for which he was recognized in 1994-1995 with the Gawad Sikolohiyang Pilipino from the Pambansang Samahan sa Sikolohiyang Pilipino, the Gawad Cecilio K. Lopez from the UP Sentro ng Wikang Filipino, and recognition from the UP Departmento ng Filipino at Panitikan ng Pilipinas. These two are among the cornerstones of his legacy as UP President."

Writer, poet, critic, dramatist, mentor, scholar, political prisoner, activist. Dr. Bienvenido L. Lumbera, National Artist for Literature, was all this and more.

With his passing on September 28, 2021, at the age of 89, Dr. Lumbera—Ka Bien to his friends and colleagues—left behind a distinguished body of works and a legacy of fearless activism, harnessing the power of literature and the arts for the cause of freedom, truth, and nationalism.

 

A writer’s childhood

Dr. Lumbera’s literary work encompasses multiple genres, from poetry to stage plays and librettos. His love for these different genres stems from his childhood. Born in Lipa, Batangas, on April 11, 1932, to Timoteo and Carmen Lumbera.  Young Bienvenido was orphaned at an early age. He and his older sister Leticia were cared for initially by their paternal grandmother, then when the war ended, by his godparents, Enrique and Amanda Lumbera.

Despite the tragedy he had experienced at such a young age, Lumbera recalled having a rich childhood. He played with the neighboring kids, played the action movies he watched and listened to his aunts read aloud from the novella series in Liwayway magazine. His childhood experiences in the historic town of Lipa formed the foundation of his writing career.  One of his renowned musical dramas, Hibik at Himagsik nina Victoria Laktaw, is set in his childhood town.

Lumbera went to Lipa Elementary School and finished high school at Mabini Academy. Initially, he wanted to attend college at the University of the Philippines. However, his guardians, who supported his education, convinced him to enroll at the University of Santo Tomas instead. It was closer to their place of work. In 1957, he earned his B.Litt in Journalism from UST.  In 1967, he obtained his M.A. and Ph.D.  in Comparative Literature from Indiana University.  His groundbreaking dissertation focused on Tagalog poetry from the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries. While studying in the U.S., he threw himself entirely into education in culture—film, theater, opera, jazz, and everything in between.

After coming home from the U.S., Lumbera taught Literature, Philippine Studies, and Creative Writing at the Ateneo de Manila University. This period saw his activist spirit ignite. He was involved in the Filipinization movement in the 1960s, and served as the chairman of the Panulat Para sa Kaunlaran ng Sambayanan (PAKSA), an organization of activist-writers. His activism was so well-known that when Ferdinand Marcos declared Martial Law in 1972, Lumbera knew he was among those targeted for arrest and was forced underground. He was arrested in January 1974, and released a year later after Cynthia Nograles, his former student at Ateneo de Manila University, appealed for his release. The two were married a few months later.

A nationalist writer in the time of Martial Law and beyond

In an interview with Rappler published on April 12, 2017, Lumbera shared an experience he had following his release from prison during Martial Law. He described how department stores hired people to dress up and pose in shop windows as living mannequins."

20% of UP students affected by Typhoon Odette – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/20-of-up-students-affected-by-typhoon-odette/,"


An estimated 20% of students of the University of the Philippines (UP) are still affected by the aftermath of Typhoon Odette, according to the UP Office of Student Financial Assistance (OSFA).

Many of these students live in four regions identified to be at high risk for the effects of typhoons: Regions VI, VII, VIII, and CARAGA. Roughly 17.2% of the University’s student population live in these regions, devastated by Typhoon Odette, which hit the country on December 16 and caused severe and widespread damage throughout central and southern Philippines.

Regions IV-B and X, considered moderate to high-risk regions where some provinces were also severely affected by Typhoon Odette, are called home by around 2.8% of UP’s student population.

Following the Typhoon, in Memorandum RAG 2021–53 dated December 20, 2021, Assistant Vice President for Student Affairs Richard Philip Gonzalo asked concerned units across the UP System to reach out to affected students. These units advised students to file applications, especially those with no records in the Student Learning Assistance System (SLAS). The University will document students needing support and fast-track financial aid processing. Gonzalo also urged the Student Affairs offices to meet with their respective scholarship committees to find ways to expedite the processing of financial assistance of those affected. Anticipating that some of the grantees will be in areas where banks have temporarily ceased operations due to the Typhoon, he encouraged Student Affairs units to explore alternative means of sending financial assistance to shorten the time for support to reach the students.

As of January 4, 2022, the University has 851 documented financially vulnerable students. One hundred and seventy-five (175) belong to households earning an annual income of less than P80,000. These students receive a monthly stipend of P5,000. However, there are 676 students from families earning P80,000 to P250,000 annually. These students may be struggling with the effects of the Typhoon. The OSFA expects these 676 students will file appeals for a monthly stipend.

With the widespread effect of the Typhoon, the University anticipates more undergraduate students filing applications in the SLAS during the restoration of internet connections in typhoon-affected areas, and Student Affairs units can reach out to these affected students.

From October 3 to 7, 11 students from the Voice Department of the University of the Philippines (UP) College of Music were given a master class in voice and solo singing by Univ. Prof. Mario Antonio Diaz-Varas, professor for solo voice at Universität Mozarteum Salzburg and international relations coordinator for the ASEAN European Academic University Network (ASEA-UNINET), of which UP is a member.

The master class culminated in a concert performance by Prof. Diaz’s students on the evening of October 7 at the UP Institute of Environmental Science and Meteorology (IESM) auditorium, with leading international pianist Ms. Tomoko Aikawa as accompanying artist. Officials from the UP System, the UP College of Music, the UP College of Science, and the IESM, as well as the friends and families of the student participants, attended the concert.

In her opening remarks during the concert performance, UP Assistant Vice President for Academic Affairs and UP System Office of International Linkages Director Imee Su Martinez thanked Prof. Diaz and Ms. Aikawa for visiting the Philippines and sharing their expertise with UP’s voice students. According to Martinez, Prof. Diaz was intrigued by Filipino singers’ skill and vocal knowledge and came to UP to find out the secret of Filipino singing at the very source. ”

“As Prof. Diaz repeatedly said in his master class, the secret of Filipino singing perhaps is in the food. While our food may have made a difference in our vocal talents, in my opinion, the skills and talents of our students are honed and shaped by our wonderful and very dedicated faculty of the College of Music,” Martinez said.

Panaad at Kabilin: Pagtatalaga kay Kgg. Angelo A. Jimenez bilang ika-22 Pangulo ng Unibersidad ng Pilipinas
14 September 2023 | Thursday | 9:00 AM
UP Mindanao Atrium, Tugbok, Davao City, Davao del Sur

Thank you all for joining me here today, in one of our beloved University’s most meaningful rites of transition. I am honored and humbled by your presence—not only my colleagues in the University and comrades in arms, but our distinguished guests who have come from far and wide, and our gracious hosts in this beautiful and vibrant city of Davao.

Today my heart is filled with joy, because I have come home—home to this great island of my birth, to the cradle of my hopes and dreams. Those hopes and dreams have never been mine alone. They have been nurtured and pursued by every Filipino born, as I was, far from what have become our country’s centers of wealth and power. 

I say this with some irony, because we often forget that once upon a time, Mindanao—and particularly my home city of Butuan—was that very center. As we often say where I come from, “Before there was the Philippines, there was Butuan.” It was a city of goldsmiths and shipbuilders, of a proud and industrious people who ventured far beyond their shores to make their mark in the world.

I, too, have been fortunate to travel far, driven both by my hunger to learn and by the demands of my profession. I went as far as war-torn Iraq where, as a hostage negotiator, I physically grabbed Filipino hostage Robert Tarongoy into freedom and safety in the middle of Baghdad’s bloodied streets. My wife and I also came home with a new daughter, an infant left at our doorstep, a blessing from God whom I am delighted to be with us today.

I also wish my dear parents were here to share this moment with me, but I know that they are watching and listening, happy if not a bit disbelieving how far in life their son has come.

But no matter how far we go or how long it takes, we always come home. That is who and what we are. Like Ulysses, we roam the farthest ends of the earth in search of adventure and bounty—or, in the case of our 10 million OFWs, of a better future for their children. 

I am home today not to boast of what I have achieved by the grace of God, but to share what I have learned, and beyond myself, what this great institution I am now privileged to lead has achieved and what it can still offer. 

Datu Mankalagan to my Manobo family, and Angelo Azura Jimenez to everyone else, I humbly accept the honor and the challenge of serving as the 22nd President of the University of the Philippines. I do so with much optimism and enthusiasm, tempered only by my awareness, gained over these past six months of practice, that the leadership of this University is one of this country’s heaviest and most complex responsibilities.

But it is also the opportunity of a lifetime—not just mine, but that of my generation—to serve the Filipino people with all I have learned from this institution and from my engagements with the world. 

I came of age under the shadow of martial rule. I learned that even under adverse circumstances, there was much that could be done to seek for ourselves and our society the benefits of knowledge and collective action. As a student leader, I felt and understood what burned in the heart of every Isko and Iska: the desire to serve and to make a difference in the lives of our people. Beyond our much-vaunted talent, this is the true hallmark of a UP native, the service gene that seems to have been coded into our DNA.

We chose our own paths. I became a lawyer, and devoted myself to advancing the welfare of our working men and women. I never expected then that I would be where I am now, coming full circle, on an upward spiral, from student to president.

But as I am reminded every day by the many exciting things that pass my way—a new research program, a request for UP’s expertise—I remain and will forever be a student. In these years ahead, I will listen to you, my dear colleagues, my seniors and my juniors, drawing on your wisdom and experience to make the best possible decisions for the good of our University and our people. 

 

“I pledge to be fair, to be transparent, to be accountable, and to serve you to the best of my ability.” President Jimenez makes this promise during his Investiture Ceremony held at the UP Mindanao Atrium, UP Mindanao campus, Davao City. Photo by Abraham Arboleda, UP MPRO.

 

I pledge to be fair, to be transparent, to be accountable, and to serve you to the best of my ability. If I do wrong, let me know how we can set things straight and move forward. If I do right, then encourage me to stay the course, to be firm and strong, and above all, to be humble. 

I’m especially honored to be joined today not only by my UP family, but also by the presidents and representatives of our State Universities and Colleges, for whom we have organized a summit meeting. This summit will explore the many possibilities for enhancing and strengthening partnerships between our institutions. I will address these possibilities in our meeting tomorrow, at length and in greater detail.

The University of the Philippines has been named one of the world’s top 100 universities for development studies by British company Quacquarelli Symmonds (QS).

It appeared in the 51-100 bracket in the 2019 QS World University Rankings by Subject Area published on 27 February. This is the first time since 2017 that UP has been ranked in the subject.

The 2019 rankings cover 48 subjects in five broad areas. Although UP scored in 34 subjects, it was included in the rankings for only 14.

The national university advanced several places in politics and international studies and was able to maintain its position in English language and literature, agriculture and forestry, medicine, environmental sciences, and sociology. This year likewise saw UP’s initial entry in geography, business and management studies, economics and econometrics, and law. However, UP slipped in the rankings for archaeology as well as in modern languages, and lost a place in the table for linguistics."

“I talked to this jeepney driver who told me he had changed his mind about this administration. He was listening to this daily radio drama where one of the characters was a drug addict who got killed in a police operation. For him, it was a turning point.” This is how Assistant Professor Cleve Kevin Robert Arguelles retells a story of one of his interviewees for his research on populist publics which earned him the distinction of best thesis in his master’s program abroad.

First love: research

Like most Political Science majors, Cleve chose his undergraduate program as a stepping stone to Law. After several Political Science courses, he began to develop an interest in politics and its relatively “non-legal” aspects, such as political dynamics and political behavior. In his senior year, he became a research assistant to Professor Dr. Clarita Carlos of the UP Diliman Department of Political Science. Dr. Carlos mentored Arguelles in a wide array of research projects which he found fascinating. It was the demand to multitask that captured his interest: working with a different agency every day, from the Metro Manila Development Authority to the International Labor Organization.

 

Prof. Arguelles in an interview at ANC’s Talkback

 

The decision to teach came a little later, before graduation, when he realized that teaching was something he had been doing both as an activist and a former Regent, by going around UP’s constituent units and discussing UP issues with a big audience. His first applications for teaching went to other state universities in Manila because he wasn’t very confident that he would get accepted in UP. His primary motivation was still anchored on his first love: research. “We produce knowledge, but before we do that, you have to acquire knowledge first,” Cleve adds.

His first years of teaching in the Polytechnic University of the Philippines and the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila exposed him to realities outside UP—big classes, inadequate facilities, and different teaching styles. Looking back, he was thankful for the experience of teaching in other universities and handling students who were not political science majors. When he finally taught Political Science majors in UP Manila, the transition was not that difficult. Arguelles is currently the Chair of the Political Science Program which entails not just an academic but an administrative workload as well.

He believes UP can excel further by blending research into teaching, which develops not just critical thinking skills but sparks the interest of students for research even in non-method courses. With a research mindset, UP students may be able to transition from being mere consumers of knowledge to producers as well.

A different kind of training

Arguelles finished finished an MA degree in Political Science (US diploma) and a Master’s Further Level Specialization Degree in Comparative Political Science (Hungarian diploma) in the Central European University (CEU) in Budapest, Hungary, with highest honors (summa cum laude). “I was already doing graduate studies here in Diliman in Philippine Studies first, before transferring to Political Science. However, I wanted to be acquainted with a different kind of training. UP is already the top institution in the country, but in the region and in the world, we still need to catch up,” says Arguelles.

One of the members of the newly discovered genus, “Balete’s mouse, “was caught on camera. Photo by Danilo Balete.

They might not get as much attention as the Amazon Rainforest or the Great Barrier Reef, but the mountains of the Philippines are some of the most biodiverse places on the planet.

Inch for inch, these misty cloud forests are home to more unique species of mammals per square mile than anywhere else on Earth. Finding these mammals, most of which are tiny and hard to spot, is challenging work for even the most seasoned scientists. But the late biologist Danilo “Danny” Balete, University of the Philippines (UP) Los Baños alumnus, lecturer at the UP Diliman Institute of Biology, and former research associate in the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, had a special knack for fieldwork. One of the mice he discovered turned out to be not just a new species but a new genus entirely.

“In the past several decades, we’ve learned just how incredibly important the Philippines are in terms of being home to mammals that are found nowhere else, and a lot of that knowledge can be traced back to fieldwork led by Danny Balete,” says Larry Heaney, the curator of mammals at Chicago’s Field Museum and senior author of the paper describing the new mouse in the Journal of Mammalogy.

“Naming a new species after anyone is a big deal, a major honor given to people who make long-term, high-impact contributions to biodiversity science,” says Dakota Rowsey, the study’s first author and the vertebrate collections manager at Arizona State University and research associate at the Field Museum. “Naming a new genus after someone is one of the highest honors biologists can bestow.”

“Sky islands” in the Philippines

The mountainous geography of the Philippines contributes to its biodiversity. Its high mountains are cooler and much wetter than the surrounding lowlands, making it difficult for small mammals to get from one mountain peak to the next. As a result, they tend to stay isolated on their own “sky islands,” evolving separately from each other and forming new species.

“The taller and the bigger the mountain range, the more species of mammals will be living there that don’t live anywhere else in the world,” says Heaney.

Filipino biodiversity scientist

Heaney has been studying the mammals of the Philippines for 40 years, and he first met Danny Balete in the late 1980s. At the time, Balete had completed his Bachelor of Science degree in Zoology from UPLB. He was already making a name for himself with his love of nature and skill at fieldwork.

“I was establishing a research program and asked, ‘Who would be a good, enthusiastic young person to take into the field?’ And several people immediately said, ‘Danny Balete.’ So I invited him to do field work with me, and he did fantastically well,” remembers Heaney. “He was just a superb field biologist. Danny could identify every plant, every frog, every bug, everything that you encountered. It was just astounding.” Balete and Heaney went on to work together for the next 25 years until Balete’s sudden death in 2017.

“Danny contributed hugely to scientific knowledge about biological diversity in the Philippines. His enjoyment of biodiversity was infectious, making him a mentor and inspiration to a generation of researchers and conservationists,” says Mariano Roy Duya, Assistant Professor at the Institute of Biology, UP Diliman, and co-author of the new publication. “By the time of his death at far too young, he was already one of the most prominent biodiversity scientists working in the Philippines.”

Even after his death, Balete continues to shape what scientists know about Philippine mammals. When scientists discover something in the field, it often takes years for their work to be analyzed, written up, and published. That is the case with the newly described shrew mouse.

In 2007 and 2010, Balete went on expeditions to Mount Kampalili on the island of Mindanao as part of a Field Museum collaboration with the Philippine Eagle Foundation. The museum wanted to know what mammals lived alongside one of the largest and most critically endangered birds, the Philippine eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi)."

The five were selected out of 11 program nominees for the 2019 award. The selection committee was composed of Vice President for Public Affairs Elena Pernia, Professor Emeritus of Sociology Manuel Flores Bonifacio, Dr. Jaime Veneracion of the UP Diliman Department of History, and Padayon Public Service Office Director Jeanette Yasol-Naval.

“Public service initiatives, especially the brand that characterizes the University of the Philippines, are implemented with high ethical standards, professionalism, and service to the country,” Pernia said on excellence. “We must do projects that innovate, that are significant, progressive, and transformative.”

“In the three years of the award, 21 public service initiatives have been recognized for excellence from a pool of over 50 nominations,” Pernia said.

According to President Danilo Concepcion, being a public servant is “perhaps the most honorable profession ever anywhere”, providing an opportunity for improving the lives of many. He then extended the definition of excellent public service to an attitude of treating the public as “boss”. “We must serve with a smile, with open hands, and gentle words,” he said in Filipino.

Public service has never been an easy task, which is why the University of the Philippines (UP) hosted the 4th annual Gawad Pangulo Awards for Excellence: to honor the many Filipino men and women in public service. This year’s theme is “UP’s Public Service Initiatives in the time of the COVID-19 Pandemic”, focusing on awarding achievements that these Filipinos have accomplished that have helped the country during this global pandemic.

Since the country is still under lockdown, this year’s awards ceremony was held virtually, hosted by UP Assistant Vice President for Public Affairs Jose Wendell P. Capili. Watch the replay of the livestream on TVUP’s YouTube channel.

The first speaker for the event was none other than UP President Danilo L. Concepción, welcoming all the attendants to this event honoring the 15 awardees for their achievements in public service.

UPOU: Pioneering MOOCs in the country – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/upou-pioneering-moocs-in-the-country/,"UPOU: Pioneering MOOCs in the country
May 10, 2017 | Written by Arlyn VCD Palisoc Romualdo



If you’d like to teach 2,000 students at any given time but can’t cram them into one classroom, what do you do? The UP Open University (UPOU) has the answer—and the good news is, it’s free, it’s open to everyone, and you don’t even have to catch a ride to get there. It’s the massive open online course (MOOC), and the UPOU was the first in the country to offer it.

It was in July 2013—eight months after the New York Times dubbed 2012 as “The Year of the MOOC”—when UPOU offered the introductory course on mobile application development using the Android platform to anyone who was interested, wherever they were in the world, free of charge.

It was developed by the UPOU Faculty of Information and Communication Studies (FICS) in partnership with Smart Communications, Inc. (Smart) as the result of a memorandum of agreement signed in February 2013.

At that time, MOOCs had been around for five years. The term was coined in 2008 by Professor Dave Cormier of the University of Prince Edward Island in Canada to describe “Connectivism and Connective Knowledge,” a course offered by the University of Manitoba, also in Canada.

Gaining global momentum 

The MOOCs phenomenon quickly gained momentum around the world, with top universities like Harvard and Stanford offering free online courses through sites like Coursera, edX, and Udacity.

UPOU, the country’s leading open and distance e-learning provider, was quick to recognize the potential of MOOCs to reach an even wider audience, to make education more open and accessible, and to promote lifelong learning.

Apart from these, “MOOCs can improve the quality of teaching and learning by fostering open educational practices (OEP),” Faculty Regent Patricia Arinto, former dean of the UPOU Faculty of Education, said in an interview.

In essence, these practices are collaborative, where “resources are shared by making them openly available, and pedagogical practices are employed which rely on social interaction, knowledge creation, peer-learning, and shared learning practices,” explained Dr. Ulf-Daniel Ehlers, Vice President for Quality and Academic Affairs at the Baden Wurttemberg-State University, Germany, in a paper published in the Journal of Open, Flexible and Distance Learning in 2011. Arinto added that apart from enrollment numbers and completion rate, the impact of MOOCs on “pedagogical perspectives, teaching and learning practices, and even the achievement of learning outcomes in specific contexts” are also indicators of success.

Relying on its years of experience in open and distance education, with the evolution of its course materials from print to multimedia to hypermedia, its move toward e-learning, and the growth of many class sizes beyond 150 students, UPOU went to work on its first MOOC."

UP campuses around the nation light it up for Christmas – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/up-campuses-around-the-nation-light-it-up-for-christmas/,"


This December saw the return of a familiar sight in UP campuses across the nation as crowds gathered—the first time for many since the COVID-19 pandemic began—to celebrate their respective pag-iilaw or lighting ceremonies. From UP’s Baguio to Mindanao campus, officials, performers, and onlookers gathered to switch on the lights and decorations that herald the holiday season.

After two long years, the familiar crowds were there to greet the turning on of the lights in UP Diliman’s Oblation Plaza on December 9. Diliman’s pag-iilaw had the theme, Bagong Tahak, Bagong Galak, and celebrated the strength of the UP community and its ability to face and move beyond adversity. The pre-lighting ceremony featured performances by the acapella group Iskollas, UP College of Music Professor of Strings and Chamber Music Solaiman Jamisolamin, and UP student RJ Balledos. The UP Filipinania Dance Group (FDG) performed wasiwas, a Pangasinan dance, as a prelude to the light ceremony.

With all other lights turned off, UPD College of Fine Arts faculty member Abdulmari Imao’s art installation, KAThAKATAKA, was finally switched on. Inspired by the ‘miracle plant,’ katakataka, found at the Oblation base, the installation symbolizes resilience and, in Oblation creator and National Artist for Sculpture Guillermo Tolentino’s words, the capacity of deep-rooted patriotism to “grow anywhere in the Philippines.”

It was the first online graduation for the UP Open University (UPOU)—13 years after its education delivery mode went fully online.

On December 5, in its 24th commencement exercises, UPOU conferred degrees and titles upon the 412-strong Class of 2020 in a virtual ceremony. Sixty-one were in the undergraduate level and 351 in the graduate level.

Four graduated magna cum laude: Anne Margarette Bacomo and Kimberly Dollente with Bachelor Arts in Multimedia Studies (BAMS) degrees, and Mariebelle Balazuela and Klaudette Zarah Leisibach with Bachelor of Education Studies (BES) degrees.

There were three cum laude graduates: Katherine Joy Cruz (BAMS), Paulo Reyes (BES), and Candice Mae Tiongson (BAMS).

On the graduate level, 11 made it to the Chancellor’s List, which requires a general weighted average (GWA) of 1.00 to 1.14. Twenty-two were on the Dean’s List, which requires a GWA of 1.15 to 1.24.

While UPOU’s traditional commencement exercises may have been the only opportunity for some to finally meet their classmates and teachers in person, UPOU Chancellor Melinda Bandalaria pointed out that attendance by members of the graduating class was only at 70 to 80 percent. In her message, she asked the Class of 2020 to look at the online ceremony from a different perspective–that of UPOU’s advocacies on equity and inclusion.

The first virtual graduation ceremony harnessed the same technologies UPOU uses to provide inclusive education so as to also make sure each and every graduate, and their family members and loved ones, are part of the celebratory event.

“This is not just a ceremony, but a symbol of inclusion and equity that better demonstrates the openness of our University,” Bandalaria said.

 

UP President Danilo Concepcion tells the UPOU Class of 2020 that it is part of the first generation of Iskolar ng Bayan to graduate in a time of pandemic. “I expect you to lead our country in rising from the ravages of this tragedy. Use your UP education wisely. With courage and excellence, may you fulfill your duties as good citizens with the heart and mind for our people and nation.” Screenshot by Misael Bacani of UP MPRO from the 24th UPOU Commencement Exercises live stream via YouTube.

 

In his message, UP President Danilo Concepcion reminded the graduates that a time of crisis should be used as an opportunity to further persevere, improve, and serve the country. “Live the UP spirit—unity and service rendered with honor and excellence—and prove that we, the University and its alumni, will not waver in our quest to find effective, alternative solutions to society’s problems.”"

University of the Philippines (UP) campuses marked the beginning of their celebration of the holidays with the traditional pag-iilaw or lighting ceremony, when officials turned on the holiday lanterns and decorations on campus.

UP Diliman had its pag-iilaw on December 3, 2021. It is celebrating the holidays with the theme, “Ugnayan at Pagpupugay: Tulay ng Buhay at Pag-asa Ngayong Pandemya”, roughly translated as, connecting and giving praise: bridge for life and hope in this time of pandemic.

This is reflected in the art installations of Toym Imao, consisting of the likeness of a blazing star in front of the Quezon Hall columns and “UP” in baybayin at the Oblation all the way to the Quezon Hall bridge; and of “Sambabaylaan” lanterns marking the portals and locations on campus allocated for COVID-19 response, with smaller versions lining up University Avenue and the Academic Oval.

UP celebrates 113th anniversary and 2nd anniversary during the COVID-19 pandemic – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/up-celebrates-113th-anniversary-and-2nd-anniversary-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/,"


 

The University of the Philippines (UP) celebrates its 113th founding anniversary today and its second during the COVID-19 pandemic.

As with last year’s celebration, UP’s 17 campuses are still closed. In addition, the country remains under quarantine to contain the spread of the viral disease that shut the world down in 2020. However, the faculty, students, staff, alumni, and other members of the UP community continue to commemorate UP’s annual milestones with a sense of nostalgia and longing for life in the University’s verdant campuses again, a sense of pride in UP’s continuing achievements through this extraordinary period in its history, and hope for a University of the Philippines for the future in a post-COVID world.

113 years of excellence

The country’s premier state university was founded on June 18, 1908, through Act No. 1870 of the Philippine Assembly, with the mandate to give “advanced instruction in literature, philosophy, the sciences and arts, and to give professional and technical training” to every qualified student regardless of “age, sex, nationality, religious belief, and political affiliation.”

Over the past 113 years, the University evolved from being the pinnacle of the American-established educational system to a “University for the Filipino” as envisioned by its first president, Murray Simpson Bartlett. It weathered through World Wars and the recovery effort, periods of political unrest and the subsequent declaration of Martial Law in 1972, the end of a dictator’s reign and the return to democracy, and the transition into a digital world racing toward the Fourth Industrial Revolution. [Click here for a more detailed history of UP.]

In 2008, UP celebrated its first centennial. The Republic Act No. 9500 was also signed this year, establishing UP as the country’s national university. By the year 2017, when former UP College of Law Dean Danilo L. Concepcion took the reins as UP President, UP had grown into a massive University System consisting of eight constituent universities located in 21 campuses throughout the Philippine archipelago.

UP in the “new normal”

Then in 2020, UP confronted its biggest crisis since the Second World War as the world grappled with a hundred-year pandemic. The University met this new challenge head-on, harnessing its considerable knowledge resources to aid the members of its academic community, the government, and the country’s citizens. UP scientists and engineers have created locally produced, accurate, and affordable COVID-19 test kits, personal protective equipment, sanitation facilities, and much-needed sanitation chemicals. UP social scientists and researchers have mapped the progression of the disease through the country, creating databases and generating research that would inform policy and decision-making on the national and local levels. UP artists and musicians have shared works that inspire, give hope, and pay tribute to the country’s heroes. UP students, alumni, administrators, and residents have come together to help the UP community survive the viral outbreak and the quarantine. And UP’s doctors, nurses, and healthcare providers through the UP Philippine General Hospital once again heroically serve those in need despite the risks to life and well-being."

The Faculty of Management and Development Studies (FMDS) of the UP Open University (UPOU), in partnership with the Edu-Connect Southeast Asia Association – Taiwan launched the Project LAKBAY: Learning Actively through Knowledge-Based Appreciation for Youth, a Youth Cultural and Learning Immersion Camp. The Project LAKBAY was a hybrid event, with the first part conducted online through the UPOU Canvas from 28 to 30 June 2023, and the immersion camp facilitated in person from 4 to 14 July 2023 at UPOU Headquarters, Los Banos, Laguna. The Project LAKBAY was participated in by a total of 36 LAKBAY fellows – 24 Taiwanese participants from different universities in Taiwan, 17 Filipino participants from Kaya Natin! Youth – Los Baños (KNY-LB),  and seven members of the University of the Philippines Open University Student Council (UPOU-USC).

The term “LAKBAY” itself holds profound significance as it translates to “Journey” in Filipino. This project sought to foster awareness and encourage active engagement in global sustainability programs, emphasizing the importance of including youth voices in shaping sustainability-related initiatives across various development fields.

FMDS Dean Joane Serrano and University of the Philippines Visiting Professor Dr. Eing-Ming Wu spearheaded Project LAKBAY by focusing on the interconnections between multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The LAKBAY fellows embarked on learning visits to various institutions such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB), International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Southeast Asian Regional Center for Graduate Study and Research in Agriculture (SEARCA), ASEAN Centre for Biodiversity (ACB), National College of Public Administration and Governance (NCPAG), and UP Resilience Institute (UPRI). These visits aimed to broaden the fellows’ understanding of the contributions of different institutions to national and global development.

In addition to institutional visits, the LAKBAY fellows engaged in hands-on and social learning visits to local communities. They explored the woodcarving communities of Paete, Laguna, the embroidery communities of Lumban, Laguna, and the trolley community of Brgy. San Antonio, and the Gawad Kalinga community, both situated in Los Baños, Laguna. These experiences allowed the participants to gain a profound understanding of local challenges and witness the power of community-driven solutions. Through hands-on learning, LAKBAY fosters personal connections and supports local businesses. It goes beyond traditional education, igniting the fellows’ empathy and understanding. These learning visits and workshops are an effective way of communicating knowledge and information. Learning by doing offers a more personal approach and a deeper sense of connection to the community.

Embodying the spirit of Bayanihan, a traditional Filipino practice of communal unity and cooperation, Project LAKBAY sought to foster collaborations among the participants. Workshops, group activities, and seminars conducted at the Centennial Center for Digital Learning (CCDL) facilitated active participation and brainstorming for context-specific solutions to address community needs effectively.

Although physical travel across states and physical activities involving international delegations have been restricted by the pandemic, people and institutions worldwide have developed a greater capacity to utilize communications technology to overcome this obstacle. With the theme of “Strengthening the ASEAN Education Delivery Systems in Challenging Times”, the 2021 ASEAN Youth Volunteer Programme (AYVP) officially began last August 30 using Zoom, social media apps, and online platforms provided by the University of the Philippines (UP).

Dubbed “e-AYVP Philippines 2021”, the three-week-long trainings this year feature online workshops, webinars and masterclasses to prepare ASEAN youth in addressing complex challenges faced by the education sector. The programme develops leadership and volunteerism skills among youth for them to initiate or sustain progress in their own communities. Previous ones were conducted physically in Malaysia (2013 & 2014), Cambodia (2015), the Philippines (2016), Indonesia (2017) and Malaysia (2018 & 2019).

The e-AYVP Philippines 2021 is using the UP Open University’s MoDEL Learning Management System as the conference platform. This enables participants to access announcements, information about the sessions, assignment and related readings, session recordings, and other features.

The online opening ceremony was attended by more than 200 participants, including key university officials, resource persons, partners and AYVP secretariat members. Initially, there were 73 youth registered as participants from Malaysia, 71 from the Philippines, 52 from Indonesia, 46 from Vietnam, 30 from Myanmar, and dozens more from Cambodia, Lao PDR, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, The People’s Republic of China, and Japan.

He added that the participants of the AYVP receive inputs and trainings from expert resource persons from university faculty, and representatives of government and international organizations. The topics include: best practices in addressing gender inequalities, empowering youth, enhancing social integration, and many others related to promoting “unity in diversity” and understanding of ASEAN.

So UP created the Socialized Tuition System (STS) which provides tuition discount at rates that are based on the assessment of the paying capacity of the household to which a student belongs. This assessment looks at the income as well as the socio-economic characteristics of the household.
The current STS was approved by the UP Board of Regents on 13 December 2013.

On December 10, Saloma and her colleagues from all over the country, particularly in the PGC’s satellite units in Iloilo for the Visayas, and Davao for Mindanao, gathered virtually for an online conference where they looked back at the challenges the Center confronted, and its growth despite the limitations resulting from the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Since dedicating much of its facilities and efforts to research and testing for COVID-19, the Center has been able to conduct tests for at least 40,000 individuals. Its units in Visayas and Mindanao have also trained more than 100 health professionals for testing as well.

For University of the Philippines President Danilo L. Concepcion, PGC’s efforts in the time of the pandemic exemplifies the theme of the conference, which was collaboration and unity. The activities of the Center reflect not only the fulfilment of its mandate, but also manifest the University’s commitment to serve the people through education, research and public service.

Department of Science and Technology Secretary Fortunato de le Peña paid tribute to the Center’s growth since 2009, highlighting how it has been at the forefront of the country’s efforts in genomics research and testing. He emphasized how PGC has continuously produced world class research and solutions.

Health Secretary Francisco Duque, meanwhile, underscored PGC’s research on COVID-19, and how it allowed the country’s policy-makers and health professionals to understand the virus better and enact measures that would limit its spread in the country. He also praised the Center’s researchers and experts for how they were able to produce the locally made GenAmplify real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test kit.

Presenting the PGC’s DNA Sequencing and Core Facility activities for the year, Dr. Benedict Maralit talked of how their unit became the birthplace of the Center’s COVID-19 testing laboratory. Through the efforts of its personnel, and with the support of generous donors, it was established and later earned its International Organizations for Standardization (ISO) certification in April this year. In July, the laboratory became fully operational.

Maralit also related how they were involved in the field testing of the GenAmplify kits and how their efforts helped in eventually having the locally made test kit accredited by the Food and Drug Administration."
"Democracy and Disinformation: The role of campuses, campus journalism, citizen journalism and fact-checking in the struggle for democracy – University of the Philippines",https://up.edu.ph/democracy-and-disinformation-the-role-of-campuses-campus-journalism-citizen-journalism-and-fact-checking-in-the-struggle-for-democracy/,"


“A large part of the struggle to keep democracy alive in this country—in any country—will be the struggle to keep our campuses free.” Such were the words spoken by University of the Philippines Visayas (UP Visayas) Chancellor Clement Camposano at the 3rd National Conference on Democracy and Disinformation, hosted this year virtually by UP Visayas.

For Camposano, colleges and universities, particularly UP, have become the subject of disinformation campaigns on social media. He characterized the attacks on the platforms as a vilification campaign, which not only poses a challenge to members of the university community, but also to the country’s democracy at large. “The University is under siege because there is a campaign of vilification against it, a campaign intent on portraying our campuses not only as breeding grounds of radicalism. . . but also as safe havens for enemies of the state,” he added.

Speaking to an online audience largely composed of the academe, particularly campus journalists, the chancellor underscored the role of campus journalists in challenging disinformation, particularly among members of the university community. “To keep democracy from breathing its last, we need to keep our campuses alive. Alive with ideas, with disputations, with political dreams of all sorts. Alive with politics, broadly construed,” he said.

Disinformation and government accountability

Speaking of campus journalists, Senator Risa Hontiveros underscored their role in the fight against the dictatorship of President Ferdinand Marcos. She particularly highlighted the Philippine Collegian and its editor Abraham Sarmiento, Jr., quoting his words, “kung hindi tayo kikilos? Kung hindi tayo kikibo, sino ang kikibo? Kung hindi ngayon, kailan pa?” which were a challenge to fellow students to stand for freedom of speech and democracy.

Hontiveros also recalled how the Marcos dictatorship immediately closed down media organizations after proclaiming Martial Law, resulting to the growth of clandestine media organizations which would later emerge during the 1986 People Power Revolution. “The role of the media in protecting our democracy cannot be understated,” she said, mentioning its role as providing check and balance of government, acting as the virtual 4th branch of government.

The former broadcast journalist also paid tribute to local media organizations all over the country, including regional newspapers in the Visayas and Mindanao, whose relentless reports on the pivotal moments during Martial Law aided in the fight against state-sponsored disinformation and the restoration of democracy. “The Filipino media’s courage and ingenuity paved the way for more and more Filipinos to know the truth. For more Filipinos to wake up from a deep, deep slumber,” she added.

The senator also emphasized how the media plays an important role in providing the public with information which serves as the baseline of facts, from which people of different persuasions can have a rational discussion. “Without media, and if all we’re fed is propaganda or dis- and misinformation, this can polarize societies and skew public debates,” she said. She said that this lack of a common set of evidence-based facts will not only mean distortions of reality, but it will also make government accountability impossible.

Speaking likewise on the accountability of government, Rappler Chief Executive Officer Maria Ressa said it was important for people to have accurate information from the media, as it will enable them to demand accountability and transparency from their government. “If we don’t have facts, we can’t have a shared reality and we cannot hold government to account, protect our rights, and protect our democracy,” she said.

Ressa, who has been the subject of several law suits regarding the ownership of Rappler and a supposed libelous news article against a businessman, views the charges against her as harassment of the media by the Duterte administration. She has been the subject of disinformation efforts by trolls on social media with the use of memes, altered images and misquotes. She has also been threatened by dubious social media users via messages and comments. “We have been demolished. We have been attacked, like Leila de Lima. Like Leni Robredo. We have been ridiculed. We have been dehumanized,” she said.

Aside from threats against journalists, Ressa also highlighted how social media platforms in recent years have been used to disseminate false information on the Marcos dictatorship. Coupled with constant attacks on journalists and media organizations, these are intended not to disprove what one already knows and has learned from studies, but to sow doubt. “The goal is not to make you believe something, although they seed a metanarrative for it. But the goal is to make you doubt everything. Because if you don’t trust anyone, then you’re not gonna do anything,” she added.

Citizen journalism and newsrooms

Also speaking on the role of citizens in exacting accountability in governance, the former head of ABS-CBN Bayan Mo iPatrol Mo, Inday Espina-Varona, said social media have over the years, become platforms where aside from personal rants, users can share issues of public concern. She is however careful to distinguish a citizen journalist from an ordinary social media user. “When you say you are a citizen journalist, you may not be a professional practitioner of journalism, but you report with the basics of journalism,” she said. That would include sharing accurate information and unadulterated multimedia materials like videos, audio materials or photos, to news organizations.

Emphasizing the importance of facts, the veteran journalist said one does not need to be a journalist to have the obligation to respect the truth. She even highlighted how one well known pro-administration blogger excused herself from being factual in her online postings by saying she is not a journalist. “You don’t need to be a journalist to be able to appreciate the need to be loyal to facts,” she said.

Aside from respecting facts, Varona said social media users, particularly citizen journalists, must also adopt journalism ethics in posting information online. This, along with loyalty to facts and training from news organizations, would be important skills in documenting and reporting social and political events. And speaking from her experience, she shared how enthusiastic ordinary citizens were in learning about the basics of journalism, enabling them to share stories of their community. “The citizen journalist does not make stories based on assignments, like us professional journalists; rather they report on the important things that matter to them, their communities, their lives. So, it is even more important for them to get the skills right.” she added.

Speaking of the role of citizen journalists in newsrooms, ABS-CBN Desk Editor and Producer Israel Malasa recounted how their newsroom broke the story of the Maguindanao Massacre in 2009, after they received information from a Bayan Patroller.

Malasa related how in November 2009, they received a photo from a Bayan Patroller of what were the bodies of the victims of the massacre. Working as the desk editor for the broadcast company’s Regional Network Group, based in Quezon City, he and his colleagues had to verify the information. “There was this photo that was sent to news by a Bayan Patroller. So, what we did was vet it. We called the authorities. The editors and reporters called up their various sources. And then it was confirmed that it was the massacre site,” he said. Without that courageous citizen journalist, he added, news of the horrendous incident would not have been known.

Tracing the roots of citizen journalism, Malasa illustrated how it began long before social media, when viewers of news programs such as TV Patrol, would send them information on community concerns such as ill-maintained roads and ditches, defective electricity posts and others. These stories were featured in a segment called Citizen Patrol. What made a difference between then and now was that the newsroom still needed to send a crew for these stories. “Back then what we would do is send a crew to the community. The crew would then engage the resident, the Citizen Patroller or citizen journalist, as how we call them now, get the facts and go to the authorities, interview, and then a solution about a particular problem is reached,” he said.

For Malasa, citizen journalists have contributed much to newsrooms, particularly with stories in different communities all over the country, which could not have been covered if information had not been provided to news organizations. “Citizen journalism, or information from the public, is in a way valuable, because it shows that it is not only the reporter who has knowledge of what is happening in society. If people on the ground are helping, if they are providing the facts, as long as it is substantiated, it is vetted, checked, it is an enormous contribution to a news organization,” said the UP Visayas alumnus.

Much has changed since then, as citizen journalists now can record their own materials and send their own information to the networks. For National Union of Journalists in the Philippines Chair Nonoy Espina, anyone can be a journalist as long as the person has the motivation, proper training and ethics. “[Ordinary] people can be very, very good journalists, if they have the motivation, and if they are given the skills to do it,” he said.

For Espina, training remains an important aspect of journalism which both citizen and professional journalists must have, as these are essentials in news gathering and crafting a story. “Putting a story together is not that easy. We might make it seem easy, but it actually isn’t. From gathering the facts to actually putting the story together,” he said.

And while citizen journalists may have undergone training, Espina, like Malasa, still suggests newsrooms must vet stories coming from the communities, as those in news organizations are more steeped in the professional standards of journalism and the legal regulations which affect the practice should there be lapses. Newsrooms, he also said, are liable, should libel cases arise from erroneous reporting. Referring to journalists and editors he said “If a story gets past you, especially an erroneous story, then you didn’t do your job. That is your fault. Then, you have to take responsibility for that.”

Espina however is quick to add that the collaboration between citizen journalists and professional journalists has been beneficial, particularly in situations which made it necessary for both to work together. “Actually, the best combination is the citizen journalist and the journalist. They should always work together. If one is separated from the other, then there is a disconnect [in the story they are working on],” he said.

Fact-checking vs disinformation

For investigative journalist and UP Associate Professor Yvonne Chua, one of the avenues where the public and journalism professionals best intersect in the age of disinformation is in fact-checking. As an educator, she has been teaching courses in fact-checking in the UP College of Mass Communication. “Fact-checking is increasingly becoming an important component of media literacy initiatives. In journalism education is an essential component,” she said.

Emphasizing journalism as a discipline of verification, Chua said the concept and practice of fact-checking in journalism has quickly evolved in recent years. In the past, the task of the practice of fact-checking in a news organization was undertaken by editors, who ensured the factual accuracy of the stories submitted by reporters before these were published. “The fact-checking we now refer to, has expanded to include verifying, and often debunking textual and visual claims, especially falsehoods, made by individuals, groups or institutions, ranging from our public officials, public figures, to netizens that produce user-generated content,” she said.

 

UP Associate Professor Yvonne Chua speaking about how fact checks need to be integrated in journalism programs and media literacy efforts. Screengrab from video courtesy of UP Visayas and the Consortium on Democracy and Disinformation.

 

Sharing some notes from a recent study she was part of, Chua illustrated how the majority or 57% of the 19,621 respondents they had from all over the country, said disinformation is a serious problem. About 28% see it as somewhat of a concern. While 15% see no problem at all with disinformation. Among the age groups, she said those between ages 18 to 24 were more likely to view the proliferation of false information as serious.

The same age group also viewed disinformation as having possible effects on the elections. Despite these reactions, the respondents revealed they don’t verify news as much as they should. “Despite being aware that disinformation is a problem and could affect elections, the proportion of young Filipinos who have never verified the news or information that reaches them, is significantly higher than the 7% national average,” she added.

Also with regard to the results of the survey she and her colleagues conducted, the respondents defined ‘fake news’ as news which are bad for the president or the country, with a significant number of respondents from the 14 to 17 age group, agreeing. “It’s a sentiment that we know is often spouted by populist authoritarian leaders including our own,” she said.

Aside from concerns on disinformation, Chua said the study also revealed the lack of know-how among the respondents in how to verify news and information they came across. “This self-confessed gap in knowledge and skills certainly needs to be addressed,” said the journalism professor.

Viewing fact-checking as an invaluable tool for aspiring journalists, Chua views the course as essential in journalism education, particularly in the wake of the massive proliferation of disinformation and misinformation. The skills can either be included in teaching journalism ethics or as a stand-alone course. In recent years, she and her students have been involved in several projects where they verified the claims of political candidates and leaders. Among these are Tsek.ph and Factrakers.

In the interest of keeping fact-checkers safe from possible threats and intimidation from those who may dislike their findings, Chua said it is important that those involved in these projects refrain from posting unvetted fact checks on their personal social media accounts. They must also process negative feedback on their stories. And they must also consider whether their stories should have bylines or not.

Campus publications and democracy

Discussing threats and intimidation of campuses, UP Associate Professor Diosa Labiste talked about how in recent years, disinformation has taken the form of hate speech and red tagging, particularly against the UP community. Citing studies she did with Chua, she illustrated the similarities between hate speech and red tagging and how these contribute to the proliferation of disinformation online.

For the former community journalist, red-tagging, much like disinformation, is made up of false or fabricated accusations disseminated by trolls online. It has from minimal to almost no basis in fact. It also vilifies activists, critics of the administration and journalists. And similar to hate speech, it uses threats, harassment, some even resulting to arrests and deaths. Labiste believes the vilification of the university community while serious, can be met with stories coming from campus journalists who continue to provide accurate stories of issues and concerns confronting its members.

Underscoring the need for news reports that are fact-checked and verified, Labiste said campus journalists can fill gaps left by mainstream media in the exigencies of day-to-day news reporting. These means, young journalists-in-training can provide content which cannot be found in the commercial media. “Some news are not so sexy for commercial media or mainstream media to cover. But campus press has been covering these issues,” she said.

Labiste said that aside from providing unique content on news events, campus press can pursue stories which provide differing perspectives, diverse issues and more vigorous discussions and debate. It also provides students with the capacity for citizen-witnessing, which blurs the line between news producer and news consumer, as well as that between a journalist and an advocate. “Campus journalism is a form of counter speech because it intervenes to help citizens and communities make sense of information amid lies and ‘fake news.’”

For John Nery, a journalist, columnist and educator, campus journalism remains a strong pillar in the struggle against disinformation, not only in colleges and universities, but also in society at large. “Yes, we should use our campus publications to discuss school concerns; but at the same time, we have to realize that we actually occupy a position of privilege, and that our campuses are surrounded by what we call communities at risk,” he said.

School publications, according to Nery, act not only as hubs for public discourse of those in the academic community, but they can also function as public spaces for discussions of social issues which confront a community. Using UP Visayas and other higher education institutions in Iloilo as examples, he said their publications can serve as venues for conversations. “Why shouldn’t the school publications of UP Visayas, of the University of Iloilo, of PHINMA, and other Iloilo-based schools, talk about what’s happening in Iloilo? And by doing so, turn their school publications into their own version of the public square,” he added.

On February 13, 2020, President Rodrigo R. Duterte addressed the nation on television as fears over the spread of the Novel Coronavirus 2019 or Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) gripped many. Speaking in a video message recorded at the Malacañang Palace, he assured the public that his administration was taking all the necessary measures to limit the spread of the disease. “I call on our people to remain calm, vigilant, responsible. And I also ask [for] your trust and cooperation, support as we face the challenge,” he said.

Earlier during the day, the Manila HealthTek Inc. posted on its official Facebook page a photo of the COVID-19 test kit developed by experts from the Philippine Genome Center and the National Institutes of Health of the University of the Philippines Manila.

The GenAmplify Corona Virus Disease-2019 rRT PCR Detection Kit was the product of several days and hours of intensive research and testing by experts from the University who built upon the genome sequence of COVID-19, made available by the World Health Organization on its website.

According to PGC Executive Director Cynthia Palmes-Saloma, the kit was made possible after genetic experts from others countries used Next Generation DNA Sequencing in trying to understand the nature of the COVID-19 virus. Among the facilities of the center is its DNA Sequencing Laboratory which was established in 2013.

DNA or deoxyribonucleic acid is the building block of every living being.  These molecules contain the genetic makeup of an organism, it is composed of nucleotides guanine, cytosine, thymine and adenine (G-C-T-A). Sequencing is the process of determining the order of the nucleotides in a DNA.

For the molecular biologist, Dr. Saloma, Next Generation Sequencing is essential in understanding the nature of living things, including viruses and bacteria. And it can even be used to determine the identity and properties of unknown organisms. “If there’s an emergency and there’s a totally unknown organism, and some might say that it’s a virus, it’s bacteria, or it’s an unknown, then Next Generation Sequencing will come in handy,” she said. The same process, she quickly added, was used in understanding the Novel Coronavirus from Wuhan, China.

Next Generation Sequencing, also known as Massive Parallel Sequencing, is a process by which several DNA samples can be simultaneously sequenced using computers, which produces more results when compared to the Sanger Sequencing, which can only process one DNA fragment at a time.

For Dr. Benedict Maralit, since DNA is found in all living organisms, it can be used in determining the nature of a bacteria or a virus. DNA sequencing is, he said, “a manner of characterizing DNA.” Through this method of analysis, he and his team can determine if a DNA is unique or comparable to those of other organisms. As head of the PGC’s DNA Sequencing Core Facility, he leads the center’s unit, which takes the first crack at the specimens which are sent to their institution for analysis."

Protect and Leverage UP’s Research Outputs
November 7, 2019 | Written by Fred Dabu



The University of the Philippines (UP) faculty, researchers, students, staff, and visiting professors who are engaged in research and/or creative works using University resources are expected to protect and leverage their outputs for the benefit of the Filipino people. This sums up the role of Intellectual Property (IP) creators, the Technology Transfer and Business Development Office (TTBDO), and related offices and committees of the University.

Securing IP was among the key topics discussed at the 21st anniversary conference of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-University of the Philippines Manila (UP Manila) on February 28 at the Bayanihan Center, UNILAB Inc. Complex, Pasig City.

In the panel discussion on securing IP, resource speakers Patricia San Jose, a technology transfer officer of TTBDO UP Manila, and Jerry G. Ligaya, director of the Technology Licensing Office of the Technological University of the Philippines (TUP), advised the researchers to always protect their IP rights first before disseminating information about their outputs. This is in consideration of the researchers’ aim of contributing useful information and innovative outputs through publications and presentations in forums here and abroad.

San Jose and Ligaya encouraged members of the academe who are involved in the process of creating new knowledge, technologies, products, or IP, to apply international protocols (e.g., copyright, patent, and trademark), national policies (e.g., Republic Act No. 10055 or the Philippine Technology Transfer Act of 2009) and University policies in order to secure their IP to make them more useful to the public.

An overview

According to San Jose, “creations of the mind must be expressed” in tangible form before any type of IP protection or a right could be associated with it, either through a patent, trademark, copyright, industrial design, or other types of protection for IP. “It is part of the TTBDO service to identify what form of IP protection is suited to your research data sets,” she said.

San Jose provided an overview of the process. “We search for IP in our university. We do an IP audit. Most of the time, the researchers just go to our office” to disclose a new invention or a research output, she said.

“After we discover what the IP is, we recommend that we protect your IP…. We also have to determine what mode of technology transfer is best suited for your technologies. Technology transfer is a way to further develop a technology, and to commercialize, if it’s the track that you want to pursue,” explained San Jose."

Dr. Jose Y. Dalisay Jr.
Vice President for Public Affairs
UP System (2003-2005, 2017-2019)

 

The UP Forum was created to serve as a venue for University-focused and University-related think pieces. Appearing quarterly, it’s different from a newsletter or a research journal; it was meant to talk about issues important to the University community—not just the faculty or administration, but also the students, the staff, and even the campus residents and alumni.

I had the unique privilege of serving as UP Forum’s editor twice, on the two occasions that I was appointed Vice President for Public Affairs between 2003 and 2005 and between 2017 and 2019. Being a writer and a journalist myself, I felt personally invested in the UP Forum (as in our other media) and sought ways of broadening its appeal while deepening its coverage.

The first time, I had it reformatted into something a bit more formal but devoted to the hot topics or issues of the hour, such as “Financing the University,” which I felt was needed at a time when very few UP people—including administrators—understood what it took to keep the University afloat. I also introduced the UP Forum Roundtable—and I acknowledge the slight redundancy in the title—to bring in more personal viewpoints and responses from all the University’s eight CUs.

This second time around, I again supported the reformatting of the Forum into a color magazine in a handier size, with better pictures, and shorter, more engaging pieces on less ponderous but no less interesting topics as our campus greens and architecture, UP in the movies, cherished UP traditions, and music in UP life. The Roundtable remains, although I’d like to see more divergent and provocative opinions, less safe answers, and as always, a truly broad representation of UP sectors and campuses.

Our many academic journals provide a record of UP’s contributions to intellectual life, but the UP Forum’s legacy for me will be that of providing space for the things that mean something to us not just as scholars but as people in a community—a very special community with a very special mission."

There’s no denying that we live in a digital world. Some of us check our emails or social media accounts upon getting up in the morning. We upload pictures and videos of where we are, what we are doing, or who we are with. The truth is, however, when it comes to personal information, sharing is not always such a good thing.

The National Privacy Commission has some useful tips in protecting our data online, but there are still things we do off the internet that can potentially compromise our information.

Here are some of the other ways you can protect your personal data, offline and online:

1. A chance to get freebies or discounts is something most of us cannot resist. See those little fishbowls or trays in restaurants asking for your business card so you can get treats? Think twice before dropping in your card. Remember, if it was not hard for you to put your business card in there, then it would be just as easy for someone else to get it.

 

2. It seems the need for photocopying services will not be going away just yet. Do not leave your documents on the scanner or do not forget to retrieve them if you had someone copy the documents for you. Make sure you destroy any spoiled copies where your information is visible. Some photocopying service providers may not allow you to do that, so block those pieces of information with a pen or marker instead. It may seem like such a hassle, but it is for your own security.

 

3. Sometimes you are asked for a copy of your debit or credit card. Do not copy the back of your card because the security code is printed there. Online payment gateways require this security code so if anyone gets hold of yours without your knowledge, you may end up paying for things you never bought. If you are being asked for a copy of both the front and back of your card, tell the requesting party that you will need to cover the security code.

 

4. Great service? Awful product? If your hand is itching to write on that feedback form, do not be so liberal with your personal information. You do not need to fill out all the fields, just what is necessary to get your message across. They do not need to know your home address nor your home number.

Raising the quality of public discourse

Universities like UP are uniquely positioned to intervene in the ongoing public discussion of issues and problems. This is a terrain that tends to be dominated by politicians, social activists, church people, mass media commentators, and opinion writers. Each one of these players represents a perspective, a way of framing, speaking or understanding, a given topic. When the media turn to a professor for his or her views on a topic, however, they do not expect just any type of opinion but a specialist’s opinion that is informed by the disciplines in which he/she operates. There will be times when we may have no basis to give an expert opinion, but an interviewer may nonetheless press us to speak as a sociologist, economist, linguist, biologist, geologist, or physicist. Under such circumstances, if the statements we give do not proceed from what we know as specialists, then it behooves us to make clear that we are speaking as lay citizens rather than as scholars. To pretend otherwise—i.e., to lend the authority of our institutional or disciplinal affiliation to the plain opinions we hold as members of a society is to risk undermining the authority of our disciplines, and indeed, of the university we represent.

Certainly, the problem that our people face with regard to information cannot be underestimated. The exponential growth in the capacity of the mass media to bring a broad range of issues into the realm of public discourse has not been matched by an increase in the high-mindedness of public discussions. This is a social need that the university, especially one that calls itself the national university, must attempt to systematically address."

In mid-2017, UP College of Law Associate Professor Jose Jesus “JJ” M. Disini, Jr., one of the country’s leading experts in information technology and intellectual property, cybercrime and privacy, gave a talk on “Data Privacy Act Compliance: Legal Issues” at the UP Open University.

Some highlights of Disini’s talk were the following:

The Philippine Constitution looks at privacy in three ways:

Privacy in Physical Spaces, or the right against unreasonable searches and seizure.

Decisional Privacy, or the recognition that there are certain decisions that are intimate to us, and that the State has no right to intervene.

Data or Informational Privacy for information called personal information or personally identifiable information—information about ourselves or data that we have rights over. These data belong to us, and we control how they may be collected and used.

Republic Act 10173 or the Data Privacy Act of 2012 is one of the three areas of information that UP has to deal with. The others are the Freedom of Information program and the Open Data policy for research.  We engage in many activities involving information, such as compiling lists of customers or suppliers, signing guest books during events, filling up raffle coupons in supermarkets, applying for credit cards, etc. Data subjects are individuals, not institutions.

There is a class of personal information called sensitive personal information, which includes information about an individual: race; ethnic origin; marital status; age; color; religious, philosophical or political affiliations; health; education; genetic or sexual life; any proceeding for any offense committed or alleged to have been committed; and, information issued by government agencies, such as social security numbers, licenses and tax returns. Such information are considered sensitive because there is greater harm in collecting these data (e.g., exposing a data subject to potential discrimination based on the information, for instance), and are therefore protected to a higher degree.

The entities the law regulates are personal data controllers, personal information controllers, or personal information processors:

Let’s Get Ethical
November 14, 2019 | Written by Jo. Florendo B. Lontoc



In a research university, not all vetting requires ethical certifications and clearances, but all work must pass standards of excellence, which cannot exclude research ethics. Incumbent upon the university is the institutionalization of ethical review.

Research ethics has many components. One is data privacy. In all aspects, UP Manila has something to offer the rest of the UP System.

Research proposals in UP Manila by regular faculty members, students, clinical faculty members, residents and fellows of the UP Manila-Philippine General Hospital and other UP Manila researchers are reviewed by a centralized ethics board prior to implementation. “No research project happens without the prior review and approval of the board,” Dr. Cecilia Jimeno of the UP Manila College of Medicine, chair of the UP Manila Ethics Board (UPM-REB) Panel 1, reiterates. This ensures that every research work protocol complies with ethical criteria, which include the data privacy of research participants.

“We preceded the Data Privacy Act,” states Dr. Jacinto Blas Mantaring, overall chairman of the UPM-REB, which currently has six reviewing panels. The Data Privacy Act, or Republic Act No. 10173, was passed in 2012.

Two years prior, UPM-REB was established to integrate ethics committees that had already been operating in UP Manila as far back as 1979. The National Institutes of Health, UP Manila’s resource center for health research, the UP Manila-Philippine General Hospital, which conducts hospital research, and the UP Manila College of Medicine had their own respective ethics review boards. They were three of only four internationally accredited research ethics boards in the Philippines in the 1990s, according to Dr. Mantaring.

In streamlining the structure of continuing research ethics review, UP Manila harmonized these research protocols, forerunning the UP System directive.

According to the UPM-REB Rationale: “This strategic move will provide a strongly supportive and enabling environment for research. In addition, it will maximize the utilization of its human and institutional resources, and ensure that all types of protocols are reviewed in accordance with international and national requirements.”"

Experts from the University of the Philippines on Friday called on lawmakers to reexamine a bill against fake news filed by Senator Vicente Sotto III. Faculty members and researchers from the College of Mass Communication said Senate Bill No. 9 assumes ‘fake news’ is a problem which only thrives on social media platforms.

Under Senate Bill No. 9, persons who use the internet and social media platforms for the creation and dissemination of false information can be held liable. Known as the Act Prohibiting the Publication and Proliferation of False Content on the Philippine Internet, the proposed law will impose imprisonment and fines ranging from P300,000 to P2,000,000.

While social media remains the primary mode of spreading misinformation and disinformation, the findings of the Tsek.ph team showed there were other sources and avenues for the spread of ‘fake news’ as well.

A Journalism lecturer, Jake Soriano, said that data gathered by the project showed other sources of misinformation and disinformation, which included the candidates themselves while appearing on news media programs, and other public figures who also talked about the candidates. These include “their speeches, their appearances in television, in their CV’s [Curriculum Vitae], for example,” he said.

From February 12, 2019 to May 31, 2019, the Tsek.ph team were able to gather and fact check 131 articles on disinformation and misinformation materials targeting candidates and political groups vying for positions in the May elections.

Breaking down their data further, the Tsek.ph team found Facebook to be the most favored platform in spreading misinformation and disinformation during the May elections. “Of course, Facebook is very popular in the Philippines. . .  . You can access Facebook for free. There are a lot of people on Facebook,” said Soriano. Second was television, followed by other social media platforms; then websites, campaign advertisements, and even the curriculum vitae or profile of candidates. Aside from these, there are also unspecified avenues where politicians and their supporters shared false information as well.

As for political groups, Tsek.ph data showed the Otso Diretso slate as the most targeted, followed by local candidates. Third most targeted group was the Makabayan bloc, followed by the Independent candidates for the Senate. Surveys were also the subject of misinformation and disinformation, as well as the Hugpong ng Pagbabago. The Commission on Elections was also not spared by attacks using false information.

A time capsule, a bridge between past and present. Visit any UP campus and such a description might come close to embodying UP’s place in Philippine history. Everything, from the structures to the discourses taking place within them, was shaped by some of the most profound ideas ever thought of.

In the case of UP Diliman, there is probably no other place that embodies this role of being a memory keeper as the University Archives. Located in a nondescript place on the third floor of the Main Library, the Archives contains some of the most timeless pieces bearing the University’s cultural heritage.

“We are, to coin a term, the memory keeper of our University,” said Archives Head Librarian Eimee Rhea Lagrama. “What we have here are materials—paper-based for now—with cultural heritage, research, informational and historical value.”

As one might imagine of a place that contains everything, from a National Artist’s handwritten notes to the theses and dissertations of UP students, the protection of sensitive information is a pressing and constant priority. Sadly, even for a University that prides itself on its history, not many know about the contents of the Archives and, consequently, what to make of the information found therein.

So what kind of information does the Archives section contain, and what are the right steps to protect them?

Four sections

What might appear as a unitary section is actually divided into four. According to Lagrama they are: (a) the bindery/preservation section; (b) the UPiana (containing all UP publications) section; (c) University records; and, (d) the personal papers section. Inclusion in any of these is determined by the permanent value a document gains through the course of the University’s transactions, in addition to its specification under Republic Act No. 9470 or the National Archives Act.

Many visitors associate the Archives with either University records or the personal papers section. What distinguishes the two? According to Lagrama, University records are defined strictly as comprising of documents that are part of regular transactions (e.g., leave forms).

Personal papers, on the other hand, are explicit products of UP-associated persons, be they faculty, administrators or notable alumni. “I’ll give the example of Guillermo Tolentino,” Lagrama said. “He has personal papers with us. What exactly? Biographical information, legal documents. I think the death certificate is there, school records. Some of his drafts are also there.”

Sensitive and confidential

While Tolentino has long since passed, his case makes it easy to imagine how sensitive or confidential information might be included in the Archives relating to living people. Lagrama admits that there are some personal papers and University records that contain information that cannot be accessed by just anyone.

One basis they have for allowing access to personal papers is the actual donor’s request. “We have donors who do not want specific parts of their collections opened while they are alive. I also remember that we have a collection where even the owner’s passport was with us. Although he is long gone, we decided that for passports and other personal documents, we need to look if they are covered by data privacy and err on the side of caution.”

For University records, Lagrama and her staff are careful, especially when legal documents are included for cases still being disputed. “Usually they are related to the law or, for example, to cases filed against students and facylty. These are documents that we can’t just grant access to and we are very strict about that.”

Filipino voters were engulfed in relentless stream of disinformation – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/filipino-voters-were-engulfed-in-relentless-stream-of-disinformation/,"Filipino voters were engulfed in relentless stream of disinformation
May 11, 2022 | Written by Yvonne T. Chua, Maria Diosa Labiste and Felipe Jose Gonzales.



Filipino voters headed to the polls on Monday after months of being engulfed in a relentless and widening stream of falsehoods spewed out in multiple formats and platforms that is unprecedented in the country’s history.

Tsek.ph’s second and latest analysis tracked a high volume of multipronged and multiplatform attacks on selected targets using traditional media and communities of sharers on social media to circulate posts and false narratives.

It closely resembles what U.S.-based think tank Rand Corp. calls the “firehose of falsehood” strategy that is marked by “high numbers of channels and messages and a shameless willingness to disseminate partial truths or outright fictions.”

The strategy is also characterized by an outpouring of rapid, repetitive and indiscriminate topics coming from a volume of sources. Tsek.Ph partners noted that they have many times encountered the same false claims that have previously fact-checked, even long before the election season opened.

An extension project of the UP Office of the Vice President of Public Affairs and coordinated by the UP Journalism Department, Tsek.ph is a collaborative fact-checking initiative of 34 partners from academe, media and civil society for the May 9 elections. Apart from the University of the Philippines, it is also supported by Google News Initiative, Rakuten Viber, Meta, Meedan and the Embassy of Canada.

Tsek.ph’s first analysis released on Feb. 25 covered around 200 fact checks published from November 2021 to early February, shortly before the campaign period kicked off on Feb. 8. The second analysis covers 685 fact checks published until the end of April, or nine days before the elections.

The firehose strategy of disinformation, which was already observed beginning February, is even more pronounced in the succeeding weeks as if disinformation operations were on a last-ditch effort before election day.

Most Targeted Candidates

Leni Robredo and Ferdinand Marcos Jr. remain the primary targets of disinformation in the presidential race as are their running mates Francis Pangilinan and Sara Duterte in the vice presidential contest. The focus on the two tandems is significant because it reflects high political polarization.


What is even more significant is how supporters of the Marcos-Duterte tandem have succeeded in further boosting narratives in their favor through an increase in the volume of negative messages against Robredo.

As of April 30, 92% of fact checks about Marcos were false or misleading information in his favor. The proportion of debunked false claims praising Duterte was even higher at 95%. On the other hand, 96% of disinformation targeting Robredo was negative. Pangilinan consistently received negative messaging among the fact-checked claims since November.

Negative messaging refers to claims that malign their targets while positive messaging denotes claims praising their targets. Both positive and negative messaging convey sentiments ranging from approval, support, contempt and ridicule, to attempts to deny and justify wrongdoing.


The issues on competence and character were mainly raised against Robredo and hardly against Marcos. For example, Robredo’s relief assistance for typhoon victims, her anti-poverty project, and her stint as public interest lawyer were derided. She was also accused of bribing people to attend her rallies.

Marcos, meanwhile, received credit for things he had little or nothing to do with, including bills and laws, while incredulous claims padded his personal and political performance.

Targeting Institutions

An array of false claims have targeted noncandidates and institutions associated with the candidates. For example, the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr., his widow Imelda and daughter Imee were featured overwhelmingly in a positive light. Three-fourths of the claims intended for President Rodrigo Duterte were also positive. Mention of these noncandidates was intended to boost the Marcos-Duterte tandem as they are supposed to bask on their fathers’ achievements and legacies.

The negative messaging that the media received partly stemmed from complaints of Marcos Jr.’s camp that their sorties were either ignored or not wholly reported by the media. The fact checks on the Commission on Elections were the claims about possible cheating and poll irregularities, some of which were blamed on Robredo, even without basis. The claims obviously came from the camp of Marcos, as they often recalled his defeat in the vice presidential race in 2016.

The fact checks since February saw the proliferation of information that tends to sow confusion in the conduct of voting which could undermine the results of the election. These claims include a scenario of chaos with a Robredo victory. The false claims against the Comelec in the 2016 election and the foregoing scenario in Monday’s elections unite around the theme of stolen elections, which Marcos Jr. and his supporters have been spouting on social media.

The Catholic Church, whose bishops, clergy and lay organizations have endorsed Robredo and Pangilinan, may have been less targeted than the media, but the messaging was entirely negative. However, other religious organizations that support Marcos and Duterte were mostly spared from disinformation attacks.

The inclusion of Comelec, media and the Catholic Church as targets of disinformation is telling. If the public has little confidence in these institutions, the electoral process would be less credible because these institutions play crucial roles on election day.

The attacks on the Aquino family also remain unabated. A TikTok video slammed the decision of Marcos’ successor, President Corazon Aquino, to mothball the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant as a case of putting politics first before the country’s welfare. The truth, however, is that Aquino decided against the operation of the nuclear power plant for public health and safety reasons as well as the fraud and corruption charges that plagued the project.

The accomplishments of Aquino and her son, President Benigno Aquino III, were also downplayed. Critics accused them of only erecting monuments in their supposed combined term of more than 30 years. However, the Aquinos, who separately served six years each as president, have had many economic accomplishments. By discrediting the Aquinos, the false claims try to project the dictator Marcos and his son as the better leaders.


Crowd Sizes and Endorsements

The crowd-drawing capacity of Robredo-Pangilinan in their rallies has been subject to disinformation. The claims doubted the credibility of crowd estimates of the rallies, which often run into tens of thousands and presented through aerial drone shots. Supporters of Marcos and Duterte were skeptical about the reliability of drone photography whereas supporters of Robredo and Pangilinan embraced the technology that shows the growth of their grassroots backers.

Endorsements are among the political tactics to win over votes and they involve celebrities, political figures, powerful groups and pop culture icons. Endorsements are meant to create public opinion and media events.

However, this show of support for candidates became a source of disinformation. For example, claims that American pop star Beyonce and K-Pop BTS and supporting Marcos were tagged false. So were claims of support for Marcos Jr. from President Duterte, Mar Roxas and Robredo. A newspaper also inaccurately reported that 90% of governors support Marcos.

Red-tagging/Red-baiting

Red-tagging is a form of disinformation that alleges a connection between some candidates and the clandestine Communist Party of the Philippines – New People’s Army (CPP-NPA) that is fighting the government for more than fifty years. While unfounded, red-baiting continues to be an issue against Robredo and Pangilinan.

Claims that Robredo and Pangilinan were advised by CPP-NPA founder Jose Maria Sison and that Robredo’s daughter Aika and Pangilinan’s wife, Sharon Cuneta, confirmed such connection were among those debunked by fact checkers.

Robredo has challenged the red-baiting tactics at the time when her sorties and rallies were drawing huge crowds and had benefited from endorsements from various political groups, including those that were also red-tagged.

Red-tagging the Robredo-Pangilinan tandem is meant to demonize their group by presenting them as undesirable and evil. The demonization could widen political polarization and prevent the undecided voters from considering the tandem because they are falsely associated with the insurgents.

Many of the visual forms of red-tagging were not subjected to fact checks because they offer conjectures and expressed resentment, which are framed to outwit verification.

Agents of Disinformation

The sources and agents of claims that were fact-checked as either disinformation (false information intended to cause harm) and misinformation (erroneous and inaccurate information) are most social media users with partisan views. Candidates contributed 12% percent of the total claims in the form of statements given at debates, press conferences, rallies and other public gatherings."

Cone snails: From lethal killers to medical marvels

Who could imagine that something as small as cone snails, popular among shell collectors and tropical-themed jewelry makers for their intricately colored shells, is the key to a substantial medical breakthrough waiting to be unlocked?

Perhaps it is fitting that a young Filipino scientist, Iris Bea Ramiro, is next in line to reveal the biomedical potentials in these venomous sea snails commonly found in Philippine reefs and waters. Ramiro, a UP College of Science alumna, a researcher at the UP Marine Science Institute (MSI), and now a Ph.D. student and researcher at the University of Copenhagen Department of Biomedical Sciences in Denmark, is following in the footsteps of other internationally renowned Filipino scientists and UP alumni.

From toxin to medicine

Over the past decades, scientists have reported that the toxins produced by cone snails (family Conidae) contain a unique component called conotoxins, which generate new kinds of painkillers and drugs to treat disease. But scientists have barely scratched the surface when it comes to exploring the biomedical potentials of the planet’s marine life, and the research continues.

Ramiro and her team conducted their study off the coast of Sogod, Cebu Province. They observed a deep water species of fish-hunting cone snails of the Asprella clade using a hunting method known as “ambush-and-assess.” This method involves the snail stinging its prey with its venom and waiting between one to three hours for its target to become sluggish and unable to counterattack, after which the snail moves in to finish the job. The method differed from the more widespread “taser-and-tether” technique, where cone snails use toxins to electrocute their prey rapidly; and the “net-hunting” strategy, where cone snails release venom into the water to knock the target insensible. The hours-long wait between the first strike to having a meal in the “ambush-and-assess” method struck Ramiro as unusual, leading her to investigate further by focusing on two species of Asprella cone snails, the Conus rolani and Conus neocostatus.

“No one in our lab was working on it at that time,” she said in the press release published by the University of Utah press. “I was just looking to identify any small peptide (chain of amino acids) from the venom of C. rolani that had unusual or interesting activity in mice.”

She discovered that the toxins Asprella cone snails use contain a peptide called Consomatin Ro1, which closely resembles the neuropeptide hormone somatostatin. Humans naturally produce somatostatin, which inhibits growth hormone secretion and cell production. It may be a possible treatment for cancer, diabetes, pain and inflammation, and endocrine disorders. Consomatin Ro1 resembles a drug analog or copy of somatostatin called octreotide, currently available under the brand name Sandostatin.

The critical difference is that Consomatin Ro1 is slow acting. Unlike human-produced somatostatin, which has only a half-life of one to three minutes, and octreotide, which has a half-life of 90 minutes after intravenous infusion, Consomatin Ro1 has a much longer half-life of more than 158 hours or more than six and a half days. (During a test involving Consomatin Ro1 in a plasma stability assay, somatostatin’s half-life was five and a half hours.) The peptide from Asprella cone snails can stick around much longer than somatostatin. On top of that, Consomatin Ro1 also functions the same way as somatostatin does. The human body has five somatostatin receptor subtypes that this peptide binds to activate its powers of hormone and cell growth inhibition. So far, Consomatin Ro1 appears to bind strongly to somatostatin receptor subtypes 1and 4, making it an effective compound.

“It has the potential to become a lead for pain treatment because two of those human receptors that the Consomatin targets are involved in pain. So that’s what we pursued and found it works,” Ramiro told Inverse Science writer Elana Spivack.

Sea snail-based neuropharmacology

Ramiro’s research builds upon the ever-growing field of neuropharmacology revolving around predatory sea snails, which scientists have described as “medical marvels”.

The key figures in this field include: University of Utah Distinguished Professor Dr. Baldomero M. Olivera, who earned his BS Chemistry degree from UP and was given an honorary Doctor of Science degree by his alma mater in 2008 in recognition of his accomplishments in marine drug research; and, Dr. Gisela P. Concepcion, UP MSI Professor Emeritus and former UP Vice President for Academic Affairs. Dr. Concepcion, who led the UP MSI Marine Natural Products (MNP) Laboratory until her retirement, continued the research collaboration with Dr. Olivera, which started with her mentor, National Scientist, and UP MSI Professor Emeritus Lourdes J. Cruz, in the 1970s.

Dr. Concepcion served as Ramiro’s MS thesis adviser. Later, while researching Asprella cone snails, Ramiro went to the University of Utah to consult with Dr. Olivera.

“For many years now, I have been building the Conoidean research capability of the UP MSI MNPLab by collaborating with Dr. Olivera,” Dr. Concepcion said in an interview with the UP MPRO. “Our research assistants and graduate students have been trained in his lab at the University of Utah, and we have succeeded in establishing critical technologies such as snail taxonomy, venom extraction, biochemical isolation, purification, characterization of peptides, peptide sequence determination, chemical synthesis and folding, and animal-, cell- and receptor-based neuroactivity testing. All of these are required to undertake snail venom research.”

The DOST’s Philippine Council for Health Research and Development has long since recognized the value of this research field for the country. It supports the UP MSI’s PharmaSeas Program, followed by the Marine Drug Discovery and Development Program. This support has enabled UP MSI scientists and researchers to publish their discoveries in international journals. Dr. Concepcion names at least four examples of UP MSI studies conducted by graduate students and research assistants she mentored on the peptides produced by various species of sea snails with potential application as painkillers.

As for Ramiro’s discovery of the compound in Asprella cone snails’ venom and its potential, Dr. Concepcion said they have already applied for an Invention Disclosure Incentive (IDI) from the Technology Transfer and Business Development Office of both UP Diliman and the UP System. Although the evaluation process takes time, both Ramiro and Dr. Concepcion noted the possibility of UP partnering with a private company to produce and market the drug.

“We can chemically synthesize sufficient peptide quantities for proof-of-concept studies in an animal pain model,” Dr. Concepcion said."

Meet UP’s next satellite builders
April 25, 2019 by Andre DP Encarnacion

While the country relies on strong partnerships with foreign universities to launch satellites like Diwata-2, the ultimate goal has been to build them here. This 2019, a new graduate program track launched at the UP Electrical and Electronics Engineering Institute aims to train our country’s future crop of satellite builders in-house. The STeP-UP program expands the Institute’s Masters in Engineering program to include a track specializing in nanosatellite engineering. The program welcomed its first batch of scholars this year, and they plan to launch two cube satellites when they graduate—this time completely made and designed in the Philippines.

While recent news of giant clams (Tridacna gigas) being harvested in the disputed Scarborough Shoal drew massive outrage online, it was only the latest low point in the dark history of wildlife exploitation in the region. A poignant series of cases also happened here in 2013 and 2014, this time involving pangolins or “scaly anteaters,” which have been described as the most trafficked animals in the world.

All eight species of pangolins have been declared to be at least threatened globally. The Philippine pangolin (Manis culionensis), however, has been named critically endangered. It was no surprise then that the nation recoiled in horror in 2013 when a Chinese vessel stranded in the Tubbataha marine national park was found with over 3,000 frozen pangolins on board. Barely a year later, Palawan officials confiscated even more of these from two residential buildings and a tricycle in Puerto Princesa City.

While everyone feared that Palawan-endemic Philippine pangolins were the ones involved, this proved difficult to confirm visually. As pangolins are hunted primarily for their scales, which are made of keratin (the same as that found in human hair and nails) and meat, they are typically skinned after being smoked out, bludgeoned to death, and boiled beyond recognition. For justice to be served, what was needed here was a scientifically credible system to ascertain the exact pangolin species found in these shipments.

Luckily, a team from the University of the Philippines Institute of Biology led by Dr. Ian Kendrich Fontanilla, Mr. Adrian Luczon and the late Dr. Perry Ong had been working to perfect such a system. The geneticists and the conservation biologist joined forces with fellow experts to pioneer a method called DNA barcoding.

DNA barcoding uses the molecular fingerprint of DNA found in even processed remains to accurately determine the specific species. This is done by reading selected genes like product barcodes against a database of samples collected, to aid both science and law enforcement. Together with a close-knit group of institutions, Fontanilla is working to help this database include all endemic species in the country and be a frontline tool against illegal wildlife exploitation.

Genes and Shakespeare

While the country is equipped with legislation to protect local biodiversity in the form of Republic Act No. 9417, or the Wildlife Resources Conservation and Protection Act, Fontanilla explained how difficult it is to uphold this law. As in the case of the Palawan pangolins, agents of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) used to rely purely on morphology, or a specimen’s appearance, to determine species in their custody. This, as we have seen, can prove unreliable.

It was in 2008 that Fontanilla, together with other geneticists, Dr. Jonas Quilang and Dr. Zubaida Basiao, joined forces with Ong, at that time the director of the Institute of Biology and a prominent wildlife biologist, to craft what would become their public database of DNA barcodes. A few years later, Ong approached the DENR with a proposal. “Why don’t we help each other?” Fontanilla recalled Ong proposing. “We can help you identify species at the molecular level, and you can provide us with samples.” This offer officially began the partnership between the two institutions that persists to this day.

Being more focused on the molecular side as head of the Institute’s DNA Barcoding Laboratory and now the director of the Philippine Genome Center’s (PGC) Biodiversity program, Fontanilla explained that not just any gene can be used as a barcode. “You can think of the DNA of all species like the pages of Shakespeare’s books,” he said. “Now of course we can’t identify them without their titles so now we have to pick a page from each book.”

This “page” or specific gene in our DNA is one that facilitates easy identification. “It’s like when you open page 5 and read Romeo’s words to Juliet, and then you know what work it is.” The copies of any collected gene are compared to the current contents of the database to find the most accurate match. “That’s what we do in DNA barcoding, we find a gene that can discriminate like that.”

Powerhouse

For animals, Fontanilla and his team use the gene Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I or CO1. Unlike most genes we are familiar with that are found in the cell’s nucleus, CO1 is found in mitochondria. “The mitochondria are what produce ATP (which produces energy for many cell processes); so the mutation rate there is very high,” he said. This high rate of mutation across time is what creates the variability that allows us to discriminate between even closely related species.

With genes like CO1 playing the role of the perfect pages, Fontanilla and Ong joined their partners in filling up their database. This involved going out into the field to extract both tissue samples for DNA and measurements from enough animals. “As much as possible we try not to kill them,” Fontanilla said. Using the case of local bats, he illustrated the challenge of catching and releasing them unharmed for this purpose."

It was a biology class unlike any other. When graduate student Lorraine Joyce del Rosario took to the podium to deliver a report on the last regular day of class, one could have expected to hear a thorough rundown of foundational topics in cell biology or genetics.

Instead, the polo-clad MS Biology student opened the morning with the grisly case of Beverly Allitt, an English serial murderer nicknamed the “Angel of Death.” During a 59-day period in 1991, Allitt alternated between using potassium chloride and insulin to murder four children and grievously harm six more at Grantham and Kesteven Hospital in Lincolnshire, UK.

“How should we investigate this case?” del Rosario asked. The class of nine students actively pitched their ideas. Some suggested checking going through mental health records of the hospital staff, while others suggested going through hospital logs to see who had access to the drugs used in the murders.

It was a highly atypical discussion to end the academic year. Then again, there are few things typical about Biology 397: Current Topics in Forensic Biology. Offered nowhere else in the country, the second-semester graduate course at the UP Institute of Biology is understood by only few, even within the University of the Philippines.

The course co-convener and head of the DNA Analysis Laboratory at UP Natural Sciences Research Institute, Dr. Maria Corazon De Ungria defines Forensic Biology concisely as the application of the biological sciences in answering legal questions.

Most people, however, associate the word “forensics” merely with the study of dead bodies in criminal investigations. De Ungria explained that Bio 397 tackles a far broader landscape of topics. This scope is necessary to underscore how science in all its guises can be applied to answer questions that matter to the nation and its people.

A Diverse Cast

Diversity has been the course’s trademark since it began in 2012. Not only does it quietly draw students from different disciplines and institutions, it also changes each year depending on their needs and interests. The primary purpose of the course is to help postgraduate students in the sciences to realize the social dimension of their disciplines, and in the seven years of its existence, Bio 397 has never repeated itself in terms of content and composition.

“Dynamic” is how graduate student Rance Pavon described the experience. Coming into the course with barely any background knowledge in forensics, the BS Microbiology graduate soon found himself engrossed in lectures from experts at the cutting-edge of their respective forensic disciplines.

“We had people like Dr. Raquel Fortun, currently the Chair of the Department of Pathology, UP Manila, who talked about crime scene reconstructions and the role of forensics in solving extrajudicial killings,” he said. “We had people like Atty. Jose Manguera Jose, formerly with the Office of Legal Aid in UP Diliman, who talked about the legal aspects of forensics and how DNA analysis had changed the Philippine legal system.” Other lecturers discussed pertinent topics like forensic chemistry, wildlife forensics, humanitarian work, and accurate science communication in the time of fake news.

Eventually, Pavon said, students tried their own hand at discussing topics where their research interests intersected with forensics. They reported on everything, from the use of microbes in bioterrorism and how forensic botany can link places and people to crimes, to forensic Egyptology and how the study of preserved ancient remains can uncover facts that link past and present.

In addition to a final exam, the course culminates in the drafting of a review paper that explores these intersections more deeply. This review paper will be submitted to one of the local journals within the University, so that the students can share their learnings with the wider academic community.

Pavon who is pursuing graduate studies in microbiology, is writing about the use of innate microorganisms that reside in our bodies as a powerful tool for identification in forensic investigations.

“Each person has a unique profile of microorganisms that can tell us apart from another. For example, we could use microbial profiles from human saliva samples to help us say that the saliva came from this particular person.”

De Ungria considers this diversity to be a strength, but also acknowledges that differences can lead to healthy disagreements when people from various backgrounds come together. “Since we encourage students to share their thoughts, our conversations allow us to consider and accept different viewpoints. Our only running policy is to respect one another. We must agree to disagree.”

Grads for Grads

Bio 397 clearly encourages students to take responsibility for their own learning and this philosophy is most evident in the organization of the Forensic Science Symposium (FSS) which has become an annual event since 2014. It is organized by Bio397 students as part of their course deliverables.

De Ungria describes organizing this symposium as a distillation of the “learning by doing” nature of the course, as well as a hands-on demonstration of how scientific inquiry works. “We first tell them to ask their own questions and then determine what questions they think their peers would also like to know about. And then the students must identify the experts who can best provide the answers to these questions, using FSS as the platform for these conversations.”"

“It used to be that we could have a civilized conversation about political ideas. We used to have civilized conversations about disagreements in terms of issues, in terms of values, in terms of ideologies. What makes democracy work is that we can look across the aisle and have a decent conversation.”

But much has changed since the proliferation of what is commonly called fake news on social media platforms. That’s the lament of Professor Clarissa David of the College of Mass Communication of the University of the Philippines.

In an interview early this year, David said that while academics try not to use the term “fake news,” it is still used in situations where they need to discuss the phenomenon because the term is widely used and understood by more people. “We try to avoid the term now because it puts together into one category many different kinds of harmful content that’s online,” she added.

David said that communications or media scholars have recently categorized  fake news into two types: misinformation and disinformation. According to David, misinformation is false information which is unintentionally disseminated on online platforms. “There is no propaganda intention; mostly there is no political intention,” she said. Disinformation, on the other hand, is intended to convince online users to favor a group or individual political perspective. “Disinformation is orchestrated, it’s funded, … it’s planned. In politics, it’s run by professionals,” she added.

For Associate Professor Danilo Arao of the Journalism Department of the College of Mass Communication, it could be because the journalist is not able to properly gather all the information necessary for a story or properly comprehend what is gathered from different sources. “The major mistakes would have to do with crucial data. As well as analyses that would tend to disregard other aspects of the data that are gathered,” he said.

A journalist, he said, must have a good understanding of the issue being reported and the materials gathered from various sources; otherwise,  the reporter risks providing wrong information to his superiors and the unwitting public.

Arao also said journalists who may have reported the news by mistake must be quick to admit fault and rectify their errors, especially at a time when information is disseminated at a rate faster than it used to be when news stories are were aired and published only via traditional platforms such as television, radio and newspapers.

On the other hand, Professor Rachel Khan, former Chairperson of the Journalism Department and now Associate Dean of the College of Mass Communication, thinks misinformation can also occur if a journalist is given wrong information by his or her sources; in which case, the journalist may not know that he or she is reporting false news.

With various online resources now available, Khan said journalists may be able to verify and authenticate information given to them by a source, thus reducing the possibility of publishing inaccurate or wholly false news reports.

At a time when some governments frequently accuse the media of disseminating fake news, these academics see the need for the public to be informed on how fake news is generated and disseminated and how media practitioners can enhance their capacity to verify information prior to publishing or airing their news stories on TV, radio, print and online.

 

Social media use among Filipinos in the latest report from We Are Social and Hootsuite.

 

In recent months, the social media platform Facebook announced the deactivation of several accounts which were found to have dubious identities and activities on the platform. They said that some of the accounts were even involved in the promotion of select politicians and political interest groups.

Facebook remains the social media platform accessed by the largest number of people in the country. In a recent report from We Are Social and Hootsuite, studies showed that about 76 million Filipinos out of 107.3 million have access to the Internet. About 97 percent of these netizens access Facebook, while only 54 percent use Twitter. About 96 percent watch videos on YouTube and 64 percent post photos on Instagram.

The report said 63 percent of social media users in the country belong to the 17- 34 age group, with females comprising a little over half of that number. About 13 percent belong to the 35-44 age group, while about 11 percent are teenagers in the 13-17 age group. Users over 45 years old comprise only about 12.3 percent.

For communication educators like Arao, David and Khan, social media plays a key role not only in the proliferation of disinformation and misinformation, but also in the fight against the spread of the same troubling phenomenon.

With a doctorate in Communication Research from the University of Pennsylvania, David teaches political communication, journalism and public opinion, research methods, and mass media, government and society at the UP College of Mass Communication, where she also took up a masteral studies in Communication Research. She earned a Bachelor in Communication degree from the Ateneo de Manila University.

Aside from her time in the academe, David has also worked with The World Bank, the Philippine Institute of Development Studies, the Human Development Network, the Social Weather Stations, and the Philippine Competition Commission.

A frequent resource person for media organizations, David has been actively giving her insights on the impact of fake news on media and society. Several of her interviews have been made available by the online news outfit Rappler.

According to David, one of the hallmarks of fake news on social media is how these supposed news stories try to agitate readers or consumers. “If it’s screaming at you. If it’s trying to rile you up. If it makes you angry, if it has curse words, if it has exclamation points, the odds of it being not disinformation are very low.” Consistently used as a format, this style is very much the opposite of what comes out on legitimate news organizations, which are supposed to avoid sensationalizing news stories.

Given the consistent efforts of individuals involved in disinformation to pass their work off as legitimate news, Arao sees the identification of such stories as a challenge. “The problem with fake news is that it mimics the reportage of more established news media organizations, especially the ones that are identified with the dominant media,” he said.

This mimicry of established news media organizations even goes beyond how stories are written. In some cases, these purveyors of fake news mimic websites with similar web addresses or uniform resource locators  (URLs). On a list compiled on Wikipedia, they incude: “ABCnews.com.co” passing itself of as abcnews.go.com; “Bloomberg.ma” mimicking Bloomberg.com; “cnn-channel.com” for cnn.com; “aljazeeranews-tv.com” for aljazeera.com; and, “gma-tv.com” masquerading as gmanetwork.com/news.

 

Distribution of social media users in the Philippines according to We Are Social and HootSuite.

 

Arao said it is disturbing that a significant number of Filipinos believe stories from fake news websites and dubious social media pages. It is also troubling that there are those who actively promote and disseminate these stories as well. He said that if people start believing in fake news more than they should news from legitimate sources, they will tend to make decisions that would not be based on reliable information.

“If you fall for the lies, then you tend to fall for the purveyors of such lies,” he added.

Arao teaches Journalism, Media and Communication courses. Aside from teaching in his home college, he has also taught courses on global studies for the UP Center for International Studies. He is also the former Assistant Vice President for Public Affairs of the UP System and the former Director of the UP System Information Office."

Sitting in the UP College of Medicine’s Department of Anatomy, Dr. Rafael Bundoc began by explaining how a big part of his mission was to change the attitudes of Filipinos when it comes to spine surgery. Spread out in front of the orthopedic surgeon as he spoke were his tools — silver streamlined instruments of various lengths. These instruments, and how to use them, held the key to the future of his discipline in the country, Bundoc said.

While he is up to the challenge, Bundoc does indeed have several minds to change. The idea of having your spine operated on is a dreadful thought for patients and doctors alike. This fear was born in the 1960s and 1970s, when spine surgeries were long, bloody affairs.

“In the past it was very dangerous,” he said, “because you go down to the spine, which is a very deep part of the body. To open it up is very bloody and of course, there’s the idea that you might get paralyzed because you have your nerves there. That’s really scary.”

However, Bundoc insisted that technological advances have mostly made these scary scenarios a thing of the past. In their place, we now have a set of tools and techniques that make up Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery (MISS). MISS allows doctors to get a three-dimensional view of your spinal area and the ability to operate on it directly, while leaving only a tiny incision. This not only makes surgeries more precise; it also allows patients to recuperate faster. It also dramatically reduces hospital stays for patients, and the resulting expenses.

As one of the pioneers of MISS in the country, Bundoc is committed to showing both colleagues and patients that this new world is one worth discovering. And as the chair of the 5th ASEAN Minimally Invasive Spine Surgical Techniques (MISST) 2019 Congress last month, he also now wants to show the world that the Philippines can be a leader in using these techniques to improve countless lives.

Five Ailments

When talking of innovative surgical techniques, an obvious question might be: what conditions do they treat? Bundoc says there are five fundamental conditions that afflict humans throughout their lifetime: trauma, congenital deformities, infections, neoplasms (cancers), and degenerative conditions.

Bundoc said that of these five, the most common he had encountered affecting the spine are: trauma, infections and degenerative conditions.

“We see a lot of trauma now, especially now that we have so many motorcycles. We treat these minimally invasively because we don’t want to add insult to injury. You already have a massive wound and we don’t want to give you another one.”

Of the infections, the most common he sees is tuberculosis of the spine. Today, with minimally invasive techniques, he and his colleagues need not split open a person’s back to drain the pus from the spine. “Now we just have to make a very small hole, and we’re able to drain the infection.”

But hands down, the most common and what most people associate with spinal problems are degenerative conditions, specifically slipped discs and stenoses. “Our population is graying,” Bundoc says. “Filipinos are living longer and, as we age, we develop lots of spine problems.” For him, the thought of opening the back of an already aged person is a traumatic experience that no patient should go through. Hence, minimally invasive techniques can be both an effective and a dignified solution.

Bundoc explains how the problem evolves in the case of stenosis. “You have a canal in your spine,” he says. And like most other canals in nature, the size of the channel eventually decreases as deposits build up on the bone, in this case, calcium. “Your bones and your ligaments get thicker, and when your spinal cord gets compressed, your back hurts. You can’t walk, and your lower extremities hurt.”

Millimeters

So how does a spine surgeon like Bundoc solve a problem like that? He walks us through a typical surgical process from beginning to end.

First, after the room has been sterilized and the patient’s back has been scrubbed, a radiology technologist takes a fluoroscopy, a special X-ray of the area to be operated on. After this, and once the patient has been duly anaesthetized, surgeons like Bundoc make what is called a ‘‘stab incision,’’ or a very tiny cut on the back just big enough to fit a specialized endoscope only a few millimeters in diameter.

This scope is connected to a camera system that ends in a set of monitors which allow Bundoc and his colleagues to have a three-dimensional view of the pathology and its surrounding structures. By inserting other very fine instruments, like the pituitary rongeur, a surgeon can then deal with the problem, such as the removal of vertebral discs or bone spurs.

“If you’re going to operate on just a small area, why not direct your attention to just that small area? So other structures can be spared.”"

It would be safe to think, when skimming through recent news articles of his activities, that Dr. Joel Joseph Marciano, Jr.’s sights are set intently on space. While space does certainly preoccupy most of his thoughts as the director of the Philippine Space Agency (PhilSA), a good number of his advocacies are much closer to earth. Indeed, together with his fellow UP experts and engineers, the 26-year veteran faculty member at UP Diliman’s Electrical and Electronics Engineering Institute (EEEI) has his eyes set on a problem—the country’s digital divide that continues to be a thorn in the side of those whose efforts are on providing quality virtual education.

“Everybody is aware of the challenges we are facing in terms of delivering education to the people,” Marciano said. “Our young people need to get back to school—but they can’t. We need to deal with the lack of connectivity.”

According to Marciano, to fully realize the country’s goal to meet every student’s distance learning needs, it is necessary for the internet to be pervasive, which it currently is not. “How then do we deliver education and services if the Internet is still not that ubiquitous, many people are still unconnected, and there are communities that are still left unserved?”

As a complementary measure, Marciano and colleagues from the Department of Science and Technology’s Advanced Science and Technology Institute (DOST-ASTI), where he previously served as Director prior to moving to the PhilSA, are looking into adapting an emerging technology to reach the places that the Internet currently cannot. While some television networks have explored the possibilities of digital TV in providing quality entertainment to more people, they believe that the same medium can be maximized to serve the needs of students and teachers.

 

The powers of digital

In the Full Anechoic Chamber at the heart of the UP EEEI’s ULyS3ES building, Marciano’s small group of like-minded engineers demonstrate a prototype of what some TV networks have brought into a considerable number of our households: the set-top box. This device, which allows analogue televisions to receive digital broadcasts, has traditionally been used to provide exclusive programming from digital-only channels. As experts in wireless communication, however, Marciano and a team of engineers led by Mr. Calvin Artemies Hilario of the DOST-ASTI, are confident that these devices can do much more.

There are inherent advantages for TV broadcast to go digital, which can be leveraged for educational applications. Marciano mentions a few.

First is the fact that digital signals can be more robust. Unlike analogue TV broadcast, which is similar to traditional AM and FM radio, information in digital broadcasts is converted into ‘bits’ or binary digits, which can be more readily processed by computers. These bits can be computed on and stored to make the broadcast system more efficient and reliable.

“If your house is far away from the broadcast station, the signal that reaches you can be very weak and therefore prone to errors or distortion.” Marciano says. “The very nature of digital information means that computers can detect errors in the transmissions and also apply corrections to them.” Explaining the concept of the noise floor, or the threshold below which a communication signal cannot normally be picked up, he says that digital signals, even when badly degraded or noisy, can be fitted with protections that assure reliable reception.

 

Mr. Calvin Artemies Hilrario and Mr. Jean Jay Quitayen (sitting in front of the PC), both from the Solutions and Services Engineering Division of the DOST-ASTI, test the ability of the set-up box—the black gadget in the upper right corner of the cardboard box—to receive digital broadcast signals.

Another distinct advantage is the way digital TV can send much more content than its analogue counterpart over the same channel. In the Philippines, TV stations broadcast over designated radio frequencies assigned by regulators and the width of this channel is 6 MegaHertz (or 6,000,000 Hz). This “bandwidth”, Marciano explains, is “analogous to the lanes in a road or highway and more efficient systems would be able to offer higher capacity, such as by handling more traffic or support higher speeds, for the same width of road”.  Using digital TV, a broadcaster can send multiple content simultaneously in one 6Mhz-wide channel, as opposed to only one content in the analogue TV system.

“If you are a digital TV station, you can accommodate up to six different content at the same time over one 6 MHz channel,” adds Mr. Hilario. “Whereas in analogue systems you would need six separate channels, which is inefficient.”

Anyone familiar with digital broadcasts also knows that audio and video can be more robustly represented in digital format. This means that potential students can access better quality images, which can come in handy in some areas of study.

Datacasting and education

The possibility of sending supplemental information apart from the original audio and video broadcast content is the key that Marciano and his colleagues think can be a game-changer for Philippine higher education. In broadcasting parlance that function is called ‘datacasting’, and while foreign countries already use it, for example, to provide real-time sports data and information on-screen running in parallel with an actual game, it can be used to provide an element of interactivity that the traditionally unidirectional TV medium has been lacking when used for learning.

“Now imagine interacting with your TV via your remote,” he adds. Other countries, Marciano notes, already do this for channels like TV shopping, where you can use your remote to interact and purchase via your set-top box.  “So, set-top boxes can be two-way. This is prevalent in cable TV systems, but not in free-to-air broadcast.” he notes.

Marciano thinks educators can take advantage of datacasting and the possible return-path to create more interaction with students. The following diagram illustrates their current implementation, where datacasting is used to encode and “multiplex” text, files and other interactive content in the TV programming along with a return path that provides the means for obtaining feedback. For Marciano and his team, these features enable TV broadcast to deliver even richer information, foremost with distance education in mind.

 

Datacasting serves as an additional “pipe” for digital information that enriches TV broadcast content for education. Diagram from Dr. Marciano and Mr. Hilario.

 

He explains that the return path can be implemented in the set-top box by building basic capability such as SMS, for example. “In this return path, the data you’re sending back is really not that heavy,” he said, citing multiple choice questions and daily checkups as some things that can be responded to by students and transmitted back directly. “So, you are no longer just running a video. You can pick a time to send a question like, ‘are you ok?’ or some other questions that they can answer optionally.”

“With or without the Internet, we can also try to reach our audience via free-to-air digital TV. Digital information can reach them in one hop; we just have to be able to concentrate the content in one place—the TV station. It does not replace the Internet, but it can bridge and augment,” says Marciano. “And while TV has been used in education for a long time, let us not forget the features that digital TV has like datacasting that can enrich the experience of those watching your content. For educators, the challenge is to devise and construct content that takes advantage of that capability.”

Content need not always be synchronous, too. According to Marciano, their prototype also aims to take advantage of the fact that through datacasting, a broadcaster can transparently send other content in the background while the main TV program is being played. Some materials do not have to be consumed right away and can be stored in the set-top box to be accessed afterwards. “For education, datacasting can also provide a path for sending digital information to learners outside of what is being displayed immediately onscreen. It can come with advisories like, ‘after watching this broadcast, open this.’ Then you can press a special button in the remote and it will access other information in your set-top box and run it. So, it can be a file that can be displayed, or it can be a website or a form where you can answer a quiz, or additional offline video materials they can watch. That’s possible and we demonstrate it in our implementation.”"

On August 4, 2021, in the middle of an afternoon of unsettled weather and a silently raging pandemic, a small team from a project named CONNECT—Cable Operators Neutral Network Exchange for Community Transformation, rushed to beat the National Capital Region’s impending lockdown just two days away. With an imperceptible click of one end of a cable, an indicator lit up, signaling the completion of a 24,000-meter optical path on which two wavelengths of light each transported 1 billion bits per second in opposite directions inside a single glass fiber around the size of a strand of human hair. There were no high-fives, not in this era of health protocols and distancing. Just a feeling of relief, because that same link had refused to work two days earlier due to fussy equipment. The barangay hall along Laguna Lake in Binangonan, Rizal, was finally online.

According to the residents of Barangay Kalinawan (population: 2,062), a mere 30 kilometers southeast of Quezon City, they had never enjoyed permanent high-speed connectivity before. Several entities had surveyed the area over the years with the intention of erecting telecommunications towers, but none of those efforts eventually translated into continuous and pervasive Internet connectivity for residents.

Getting Kalinawan online is part of the community networks component of the CONNECT project. But what do community networks have to do with a project whose title includes “cable operators” and a “neutral network exchange”?

There are several hundred cable TV operators in the country and they’re everywhere, some in areas where you can’t get a good mobile signal, much less decent 4G Internet connectivity on your phone. The smaller, local ones tend to build closer relationships with their subscribers in much the same way you are more likely to know the owner of your suking tindahan than even catch a glimpse of the owners of SM Megamall. Some operators even still go house-to-house to collect subscription payments, or at least they used to, before the pandemic hit.

Map showing location of Barangay Kalinawan.

The ties that bind small cable operators to their subscriber base are not only business or social relationships. They are also literally physically linked together. Cable operators, whether small, medium or large, all have this in common: physical connectivity to their subscribers.

Having infrastructure and subscribers even in areas where telco-based Internet connectivity is poor make cable operators a promising strategic force in bridging the digital divide. The rise in popularity of online video services, the precipitous drop in traditional cable TV subscriptions, and the surge in demand for general Internet service especially during the pandemic—all these mean that cable operators, especially the small- and medium-sized ones, need to quickly transform business models and technical capabilities and shift to providing Internet access and other services on top of it. There is both a push and pull for it. This is one aspect of the “community transformation” in the CONNECT project title.

The other aspect of “community transformation” has to do with residential communities themselves. Instead of depending solely on commercial service providers to set up telecommunications facilities and infrastructure, ordinary citizens can set up, operate and manage their own local community networks. This model has been used with varying degrees of success all over the world, such as in Central and South America, Europe, and even in the US. One very successful example is guifi.net, which has around 37,000 active nodes mostly in Catalonia, Spain and in nearby areas. Such an approach is certainly worth considering in the Philippines.

A local community network in itself can provide many things, such as much needed local communications during a pandemic. In Kalinawan, teachers who need to keep printing and distributing course materials and modules eagerly await, if not press for their elementary school to get connected next. A community network can be used to support local CCTV for peace and order needs, or to integrate sensors for disaster resilience, smart farming, or environmental protection. Local networks do not automatically provide Internet access, but make it easier and cost-effective for commercial providers to come in and open new markets where they have no infrastructure. More importantly, it will allow cable operators, especially the small- and medium-sized ones with limited capex funds, to easily sell Internet access either in bulk, or individually to residents by riding on top of (and consequently paying back for the use of) the local community-owned infrastructure. Either way, both sides win.

We first met with cable TV operator and CONNECT partner Telmarc Corporation sometime in 2016, after having been introduced by Engr. Alfonso ‘Tito’ Aliga Jr of the UP Engineering R&D Foundation, Inc. Our conversations with Telmarc CEO Edgardo Paynor and his sons Tyrone and Kevin soon turned to stimulating discussions on ideas like enabling teacher-sharing by interconnecting K-12 schools. We quickly brought in DOST’s Advanced Science and Technology Institute (ASTI), a longtime collaborator that operates the national research and education network

PREGINET, as well as collaborators from the Central Luzon State University (CLSU), with whom we worked in an earlier DOST PCIEERD-funded community networks research program called Bayanihanets. After an unsuccessful grant application with another funding organization and subsequent rethinking of our approach, our group applied to the 2nd Call for Proposals for the Asi@Connect Project in November 2017. Asi@Connect is funded by the European Union and Asian partners, and managed by the TEIN Cooperation Center in Seoul, Korea. In February 2018, we were informed that our application was accepted, and in January 2019 the project officially commenced."

Signing of the UP Day of Remembrance Proclamation

Day of Remembrance 2022


On September 21, 1972, President Ferdinand E. Marcos signed Proclamation No. 1081 declaring martial law over the entire country, supposedly responding to the rising “communist threat” at the time.

This year marks the 50th anniversary of this declaration that led to a decades-long period in Philippine history remembered for its authoritarian rule, a record of human rights abuses, repression of basic freedoms and freedom of the press, and unmitigated corruption and theft by those in power that left much of the country in poverty.

This September 21 Wednesday, the University of the Philippines (UP) joins the nation in remembering and honoring the heroes, activists, and human rights victims who stood against martial law and the Marcos regime. This remembrance of struggle and sacrifice is made more poignant and urgent now in a time of disinformation, fake news, and historical revisionism.

In this year’s UP Day of Remembrance, with the theme, “Manindigan sa Katotohanan, Itanghal ang Katarungan,” the University will again commemorate the legacy of resistance and heroism of these activists, many of whom are members of the UP community. As with the previous years’ Days of Remembrance, UP will hold a series of activities and events, both online and in person, in all constituent universities of the UP System across the country to share these stories with the younger generations of Iskolar ng Bayan and other patriotic Filipinos and keep the flame of truth and justice alive.

This year also marks the fifth UP Day of Remembrance since UP President Danilo L. Concepcion signed. On September 17, 2018, Proclamation No. 1, Series of 2018, declared September 21 every year as UP Day of Remembrance.

Days of Remembrance 2021

The 50th anniversary of the declaration of Martial Law in the Philippines and the upcoming national elections call for historical awareness from our voting populace.

Once again, the University of the Philippines (UP) honored the struggles of the Filipino people under the authoritarian regime and commemorated the University’s contributions in the uprising against the Marcos dictatorship through the UP Days of Remembrance.

This year’s UP Days of Remembrance was a week-long virtual commemoration held from September 20 to 24, 2021, from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon.

With the theme “Dambana ng Gunita: Mga Batayang Katotohanan at Aral ng Batas Militar”, the commemoration exposed Martial Law-related disinformation and historical revisionism propagated in various media platforms.

Five educational webinars brought out the truths and debunked myths about Martial Law and the Marcos regime. Each webinar is interspersed with artistic and musical performances that illustrate the socio-cultural milieu of the era.

Faculty and researchers from across the UP System, scholars from outside the University and overseas, and human rights activists and progressive artists spoke about the realities of Martial Law based on their own experiences and studies.

This year’s presenters and performers enshrined the names and struggles of the University’s best and brightest who fought, struggled, and made the most extraordinary sacrifices in the name of freedom and democratic ideals.

Days of Remembrance 2020

2020’s UP Day of Remembrance, titled “Dambana ng Gunita: Mga Hulagway ng Pagkamulat at Kabayanihan 1972-1986,” consisted of two main activities: four webinars featuring UP alumni and faculty who fought during Martial Law sharing their experiences; and, an online exhibit to feature Martial Law narratives of resistance and hope that continue to resonate up to now.

These online activities were held across all eight UP constituent units, and revolved around four themes: Hamon ng Batas Militar, focusing on the early years of clampdown on civil liberties and adapting to the situation with new forms of struggle; Detenido, Desparecido, a remembrance of the Marcos regime’s violation of human rights and cruelty through disregard of due process, indefinite imprisonment, torture, disappearances and killings; Sining at Panitik: Daluyan ng Tinig, recalling writers and artists who created new forms of expression, inspiring and mobilizing the masses for action against deception; and, Patungong People Power: Turning Points, on the events in the 1980s that became turning points which led to the end of the Marcos dictatorship.

In pursuit of its tradition of struggle for academic freedom and democratic ideals, UP stood at the forefront of the resistance to Martial Law and the Marcos regime, contributing to this struggle many of its best and brightest. UP deemed it proper to enshrine their names and struggles for younger and future generations of the University to emulate. It is for this reason that UP President Danilo L. Concepcion signed Proclamation No. 1 in 2018 declaring September 21 of every year as UP Day of Remembrance, during which special lectures, meetings and ceremonies will be held across the UP System to commemorate UP’s participation and sacrifices in the struggle against dictatorship and tyranny.

The UP Day of Remembrance 2020 is made all the more significant as the University commemorated in February this year the 50th anniversary of the First Quarter Storm, which led to the Diliman Commune and other watershed events prior to the declaration of Martial Law.

Jimenez said in his address to the UP Diliman Class of 2023. A national university serving the Filipino people, focusing specially on the country’s most underrepresented and marginalized communities.

 

The UP-Bangsamoro Development Program Summit Consultation
Date: September 13
Time: 1:00-5:00 PM
Venue: Dusit Thani Residences Davao

 

Mindanao has been envisioned as the country’s agri-industrial center, given its rich natural, economic and human development resources, its potentials, and its people’s aspirations. The island is key to achieving the Philippine Development Plan 2023-2028’s overall objective of “economic transformation for a prosperous, inclusive and resilient society”, aligned with Ambisyon Natin 2040 and the country’s commitment to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.

However, growth and development in Mindanao has remained uneven, hampered by such issues as poverty, social conflicts, criminality and social unrest. The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), in particular, has seen a significant drop, among families, in poverty incidence, from 52.6% in 2018 to 29.95 in 2021; but it still ranks among the lowest in the Human Development Index list of Philippine regions and provinces.

In keeping with its mandate under Republic Act No. 9500 to take the lead in higher education and public service and to relate its activities to the needs and aspirations of all Filipinos, the University of the Philippines will host the UP-Bangsamoro Development Program Summit Consultation to discuss opportunities for collaboration aiming to improve the socio-economic conditions of the Bangsamoro and Mindanao. This will be held on Sept. 13, 2023, 1:00 PM at the Dusit Thani Residence Davao.

These include the creation of a UP-Bangsamoro Development Program, which would be the first of its kind between the University, the BARMM government and local government units, and development NGOs and SUCs in the region. The program is envisioned to serve as an avenue of convergence between UP and the Bangsamoro for co-creating opportunities and collaborative action to strengthen human capital and improve socio-economic conditions of the Bangsamoro.

According to its concept note, the UP-Bangsamoro Development Program’s major aims would include:

providing a unified, inclusive, and effective way of collaboration between UP and BARMM stakeholders in crafting and delivering evidence-based development policies, plans, and programs;
increasing partnership with development NGOs in BARMM to promote and improve socio-economic conditions in communities;
promoting shared expertise and resources between UP and BARMM State Universities and Colleges to provide quality education;
and promoting creative industries, and enhancing human capital.

Slated to attend the summit are: BARMM Chief Minister Ahod Ebrahim, Al Haj; officials and representatives of various ministries and committees of the Bangsamoro Parliament; and LGUs, NGOs, and state universities and colleges (SUCs) in the region. A memorandum of understanding between the University and the BTA will also be presented by the UP to its partners in the transition authority.

 

Panaad at Kabilin: Pagtatalaga kay Kgg. Angelo A. Jimenez bilang ika-22 Pangulo ng Unibersidad ng Pilipinas
[Investiture of Atty. Angelo A. Jimenez as 22nd President of the University of the Philippines]
Date: September 14, 2023
Time: 9:00 AM
Venue: UP Mindanao Atrium, Tugbok, Davao City, Davao del Sur 

 

“The hallmark of UP in the next six years will be service to the nation. Service to the nation is constitutive of who we are and what we do. Together, we will work towards a UP that is more engaged with the nation,” Atty. Angelo A. Jimenez said in his speech on Feb. 10, when he accepted the position and authority of leading the University as its 22nd President.

Born and raised in the City of Butuan, Agusan del Norte, Jimenez is the first Mindanawan and the first Manobo, honored and named as “Datu Mankalagan” or “Great Spirit” in 2007, to become UP President. To mark the symbolic significance of his rise to become the head of UP as the national university, his formal investiture as the 22nd UP President will be held at the Atrium of UP Mindanao, in Tugbok, Davao City, on Sept. 14 at 9:00 AM.

For Jimenez, being a son of the South is integral to his UP Presidency. “It was when I got elected that people reminded me that I’m the first UP President who came from Mindanao; and I was amazed, actually surprised, maybe a little bit shocked,” he said in an interview he did for the UP Forum. “I never realized that my election would resonate in Mindanao. Finally, one of their own has become a UP President. I wanted to, in my own little way, remind UP where its ultimate loyalty belongs; and, I couldn’t imagine a more marginalized community than our IPs in the mountains where there has been an ongoing conflict and there still is right now.”

Jimenez is a labor lawyer and a respected authority on global worker migration. His work has contributed to the establishment of the country’s new Department of Migrant Workers, as well as to the labor migration regulatory framework in countries in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. A former Deputy Administrator of the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration, he served as Labor Attache in Japan, Kuwait, and Iraq, and was awarded Presidential citations for his work in ensuring the safety of Filipino workers during the Israel-Lebanon conflict, including the rescue of a Filipino hostage held in Iraq.

With his extensive background in labor migration, Jimenez has been tapped as an expert lecturer by the UP Centre International de Formation des Autorités et Leaders or International Training Center for Authorities and Leaders Philippines. He has also written papers for organizations such as the International Organization for Migration Philippines and the Blas Ople Policy Center He is a regular lecturer on Philippine overseas labor laws at the UP Law Center’s Mandatory Continuing Legal Education program.

Jimenez served on the UP Board of Regents twice, first as a Student Regent in 1992, when he was also elected Chair of the University Student Council of UP Diliman; and again when he was appointed Regent by former President Rodrigo R. Duterte in 2016, during which Jimenez also served concurrently as Trustee of the UP Foundation, Inc.

He obtained both his Bachelor of Laws and Bachelor of Arts (Sociology) degrees from UP Diliman. As a law student at UP Diliman, he was Associate Editor of the Philippine Collegian and President of the College Editors Guild of the Philippines. He went on to earn his Master in Public Management degree from the National University of Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. He was also a Lee Kuan Yew Fellow at the Harvard School of Government.

Taking inspiration from and being guided by his Mindanawan and indigenous roots, Jimenez aims to highlight the view from the margins and bring a unique perspective on how UP can further contribute to national development. Championing kindness in the University, and setting public service as a pillar of his vision and strategic initiatives for UP, his administration plans to widen access to UP and UP-quality education through various courses, modes, and platforms, as well as to strengthen partnerships with Philippine SUCs. These partnerships are intended to advance higher education in the country through shared knowledge and expertise.

UP Mindanao, which is hosting an investiture ceremony for the UP President for the first time, is the sixth constituent university under the UP System, and the only UP constituent university in Mindanao with the primary mandate to provide equitable access to quality UP education to Mindanawans. It offers academic programs in the fields of the humanities, architecture, mathematics, food, economics, social, natural, and computing sciences. As a graduate university, it offer a PhD by Research, and graduate degrees in management, food science, urban and regional planning, and sports science. Its development agenda focuses on opening additional academic programs and new Colleges in Human Kinetics, Medicine, and Engineering, to support Mindanao sports, health, technological, and bio-cultural diversity initiatives. UP Mindanao is headed by Chancellor Lyre Anni E. Murao. (For more news on UP Mindanao, visit their Facebook page)"

June 28, 2023 | Written by Jo. Florendo B. Lontoc



 

 

The University of the Philippines (UP) is steadily climbing in the roster of the world’s best universities, according to the London-based Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) World University Rankings. UP has gone from the top 44 percent universities in the 2016 rankings to the top 27 percent in the 2024 rankings.

Data from the latest QS World rankings shows that with outstanding scores in terms of its reputation among employers and global academics, and employment outcomes of its graduates, UP also moved up in rankings from 412th out of qualified 1,422 institutions in the 2023 rankings to 404th out of 1,503 qualified institutions in the 2024 rankings.

Being in the top 27 percent means that UP has surpassed more than 73 percent of all the ranked institutions. In the rankings of the previous year, it surpassed 71 percent.

In the Philippines, UP remains the number one institution, surpassing four others in terms of “academic reputation”, “employer reputation”, “faculty-student ratio”, “international research network”, and “sustainability”.

“To the best of the best of this University, our alumni, for representing our highest ideals and aspirations, for being true alumni of UP and sons and daughters of the Filipino nation which UP has dedicated to support and promote, cheers!”

This was UP President Angelo A. Jimenez’ toast to the 2023 UP Alumni Association (UPAA) awardees during the dinner he hosted in their honor at Ang Bahay ng Alumni on August 16. The social event is usually held days before the actual awarding ceremony. This year, the ceremony was scheduled on August 19.

Leading the 38 individual awardees were Most Distinguished Alumna, former Philippine Vice President Maria Leonor Gerona Robredo, and Most Distinguished Alumnus, National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Secretary Arsenio M. Balisacan. Four were recognized with UPAA Lifetime Distinguished Achievement Awards: National Scientist Lourdes J. Cruz, Dr. Nathaniel A. Einsiedel, Dr. Gisela Padilla Concepcion, and Engr. Rene Santiago. Twenty-nine were given the UPAA Distinguished Alumni Awards in various fields and disciplines, and three were recipients of the UPAA Presidential Awards.

Ten families received the UPAA Multigenerational UP Alumni Family Awards—one with four generations of alumni and three with three generations of alumni. UP Epsilon Chi Fraternity Alumni, Inc. was cited with the UPAA Distinguished Service Award for an Alumni Chapter.

 

2023 UPAA Most Distinguished Alumna, former Philippine Vice President Maria Leoner Gerona Robredo talks about the “sense of home” that UP alumni feel when they meet other alumni, when they cheer for the UP Fighting Maroons, or when they gather in celebratory events such as the one hosted by the UP President.

“We may have different stories about our college experience and yet we are bound by a shared feeling—that sense of home when we talk about UP. This goes beyond every alumni homecoming or every other chance that we get to come back to our UP campus, wherever that may be in the country,” Robredo said in her message, which she had requested to deliver earlier than scheduled because she had to catch the bus to Naga in time for the commemoration of her husband’s death anniversary. Her husband was former Department of Interior and Local Government Secretary Jesse Robredo, who died in a plane crash on August 18, 2012.

“Our lawmakers, and the people they represent, await the fruits of your labor, your commitment, and your passion.” This is what UP President Angelo A. Jimenez (PAJ) told the 23 recipients of the recently-revived UP President Edgardo J. Angara (UPPEJA) Fellowship Awards in the ceremony held at the Philippine Senate on September 26. The award, PAJ said, was “an opportunity to make works of immediate national impact.” The fellows are Filipino scholars from universities, think tanks, and organizations here and abroad.

The 19 UPPEJA-awarded research projects cover a wide range of education- and education reform-related topics. These were selected based on priority areas identified by the Second Congressional Commission on Education or EDCOM II: school infrastructure; access to quality higher education; needs-based system projecting the demands in workers’ upskilling; ensuring seamless and integrated delivery of education; complementarity between public and private education; integrated performance management and accountability system; efficiency in education financing and resource mobilization, and equity in the delivery of education; and decentralization, quality of education governance, and participatory governance.

One of the fellows, National Scientist and UP Manila Chancellor Carmecita D. Padilla, shared that she is “reviewing the gaps in the supply and demand for health human resources, assessing the health care system, and making recommendations to address the findings.” Another, Prof. John Paul C. Vergara of the Ateneo de Manila University, is looking into “generative artificial intelligence and how it will make an impact on higher education.” Riz Supreme B. Comia of WeSolve Foundation, meanwhile said that she and her research partner, Kenneth Isaiah I. Abante, are studying “the players and the special education fund and how participatory governance may be achieved in this area of the education system.”

The Fellowship runs from 26 July 2023 to 30 June 2024 with a research grant of P500,000. Below are the awardees.

More resources, human and financial, are needed to strengthen UP’s mental health initiatives. This was the bottom-line of the recommendations presented by representatives of the University’s various sectors—students, faculty, staff, and mental health practitioners—during the UP System Mental Health and Wellbeing Conference (MHWC) on October 11-12 in UP Los Baños.

They pushed for the continuation of support programs that were started during the COVID-19 lockdowns and called for more intensified efforts across all UP campuses, benefitting all sectors of UP. These included, among others, the continuous training of mental health advocates, sustained financial support for consultations and medications, additional mental health professionals, mental health breaks for all, pedagogical review, and the institutionalization of mental health units, not just programs. All of these in accordance with Republic Act No. 11036 or the Mental Health Act enacted in 2018.

In his message, UP President Angelo Jimenez declared, “What is at stake is no less than the salvation of our community and our society.” He revealed that the conduct of the conference was one of his first instructions as UP president to Assistant Vice President for Academic Affairs (Student Affairs) and Office of Student Development Services Director Ma. Shari Niña Oliquino, adding that he felt very strongly about mental health and wellbeing as problems in this area have gotten worse because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Jimenez emphasized the University’s commitment to its responsibility to “develop strong minds, resilient souls, and courageous spirits.”

MHWC plenary speakers were UP Professor Emeritus and former UP Diliman chancellor, Dr. Michael Tan, who talked about “Ginhawa, Wellness and the Academe: Sociocultural Perspectives”; UP Manila Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Medicine Chair, Dr. Evangeline Bascara-Dela Fuente, who discussed “Mental Health and Wellbeing of Filipinos”; and UP Diliman PsycServ Director, Dr. Divine Love Salvador, who delivered her and UP Professor Emeritus Violeta Bautista’s presentation on “The Place of Mental Health and Wellbeing in UP’s Educational Philosophy”. The UP sectoral representatives proceeded to their breakout sessions after the plenary to discuss recommendations, guided by the insights of the three speakers.

Closing off MHWC was UP Executive Vice President Jose Fernando Alcantara, who said that the recommendations will be compiled and utilized in the crafting the implementation plan. He also expressed hope for a 2024 conference so that progress reports on the recommendations may be presented.

“Your mentors are here to guide you, not for you to follow their paths, but for you to create your own,” UP President Angelo Jimenez (PAJ) told the first batch of mentees in the Alumni Mentoring Program of the UP Alumni Association of San Francisco (UPAASF).

The program was established in partnership with the UP Office of Student Development Services (OSDS) and with assistance from the UP Diliman Office of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs (OVCSA). Launched on November 8, it matches volunteer mentors with UPD students enrolled in fields related to the mentors’ areas of expertise. According to the Alumni Mentoring Program packet, the program “puts the needs, desires, and challenges of the mentee at the core of the mentorship experience” as it uses a design thinking approach to mentee-centered mentoring.

To the UPAASF mentors who joined the launch via Zoom, PAJ said, “You will help shape these future leaders.” Assistant VP for Academic Affairs (Student Affairs) and OSDS Director Shari Niña Oliquino, meanwhile, referred to the mentors as the “cornerstone of this initiative.” She also expressed hope that the pilot program will “serve as a catalyst for other alumni associations and private organizations to step forward and provide career assistance to UP students.”

For third-year BS Statistics major, Hannah Nicole Gaudiel, the program “could not have come at a better time,” explaining that she had some idea of where she wanted to be but she was “unsure of how to get there.” Mark Nicholas Cagas, a third-year BS Computer Engineering student, said that the program was not just about career guidance, but “about forging a path that is authentic to each of us [mentees].” He also lauded the mentee-centered approach that gives importance to “our voice in this partnership.”

UPAASF President Rosario Calderon said she was excited about the opportunity to share her expertise and passion, already advising the mentees that a successful career entails “humility and teamwork, both as a team leader and as a team player.”

The Alumni Mentoring Program runs from November 2023 to February 2024.

Despite the valiant fight the Fighting Maroons put up in the starting quarter of Game 2 on December 3, the University of the Philippines (UP) is heading into Game 3 against De La Salle University (DLSU) for the UAAP Season 86 Men’s Basketball championship.

UP started out strong in the first quarter, coming out on top at 27 against La Salle’s 24. However, La Salle started to pick up momentum by the middle quarters, gaining a strong lead.

The Fighting Maroons put up a brave assault against the Green Archers, with graduating players CJ Cansino and Malick Diouf scoring 11 points each. Harold Alarcon also took charge and scored a total of ten points for UP.

Actor, satirist, and advertising creative Manuel” Jun” Salazar Urbano Jr., popularly known on television, film, and the Internet as “Mr. Shooli”, was conferred the prestigious Gawad Plaridel by the University of the Philippines Diliman (UPD) College of Mass Communication on October 11, during a ceremony held at the UP Film Institute Film Center’s Cine Adarna.

The UP Gawad Plaridel 2023 awarding ceremony was attended by UP officials led by UP President Angelo Jimenez, Vice President for Public Affairs Roland Tolentino, UP Diliman Chancellor Edgardo Carlo Vistan II, UPD Vice Chancellor for Community Affairs Roehl Jamon, UP Cebu Chancellor Leo B. Malagar, UP Visayas Chancellor Clement Camposano, and UP College of Mass Communication (CMC) officials, staff, students from the UP CMC and other units, fellow Gawad Plaridel awardees, and guests from media organizations and other universities.

Urbano told PhilSTAR L!fe that he would not be attending the UP Gawad Plaridel awarding ceremony. “Papupuntahin ko si Mr. Shooli,” he joked—then proceeded to do just that. Photo by Jonathan Madrid, UPMPRO.

 

UP College of Mass Communication Dean Fernando dlC. Paragas said in his welcome remarks: “Today’s Gawad Plaridel ceremony is a gift of our College to you and to our family and friends in the community in communication and media and across and beyond the country. After 1,421 days since the last Gawad Plaridel awarding ceremony, we present to you our gift of an event that honors Mr. Manuel Urbano, Jr. whose lifelong work of speaking truth to power through humor is in itself a gift to all of us.”

UP President Jimenez expressed his deepest congratulations to the awardee, whom he personally admire. “I am glad and proud to see Mr. Jun Urbano receive the UP Gawad Plaridel, first and foremost, because of his continuing commitment to the highest levels of excellence and professionalism, and his precious contributions to Philippine media spanning decades, that make him worthy of the recognition; and second, for the words of wisdom and inspiration that he will be imparting to us this afternoon. Surely, Mr. Urbano’s message—Mr. Shooli’s message—will be remembered long after today,” he said in his speech.”

Jimenez also mentioned a beer commercial that became famous in the 80s. “Here in these advertisements, Mr. Urbano speaks to both young and old alike. The humble ‘roasted highland legumes’—yes the ‘isang platitong mani’—goes as perfectly well the beer and fellowship, just as much as the more expensive and sinful inihaw na pusit, kalderetang maanghang, crispy pata, sizzling sisig or chicharong bulaklak do, and so making the bonds among friends and families stronger and happier during reunions.”

Even at 84 years old, Urbano never fails to amaze his guests and friends in media with his portrayal of his iconic character, “Mr. Shooli”. His body of work has been notable for its profound social commentary, and his remarkable contributions to multimedia commercial advertising are distinguished by their humane values and unforgettable Pinoy humor.

Professor Emeritus Nicanor G. Tiongson announced that Urbano was being recognized “for directing well-made and memorable television ads, which highlighted typical Filipino characters and situations; propounded positive values like love of country, industry among workers and professional loyalty to friends, concern for indigenous peoples and our brothers in the regions; and featured Filipino personalities who made the country proud through their international achievements” and “for creating the TV series ‘Mongolian Barbecue’, which became a conduit for enlightening and conscientizing the public, and giving them a critical understanding of current urgent social issues through interviews with known government officials.”

He was also cited for his consistency in taking a pro-Filipino and pro-people stand and for speaking truth to power; for setting and maintaining a high level of excellence in the TV ads, which led to his being acclaimed as one of the most awarded commercial ad directors in his day; and for creating productions in television and film that elevated the substance and form that future generations of Filipino media practitioners can look up to.

The University of the Philippines Alumni Council, the advisory body of the UP Alumni Association (UPAA), resolved to fully support Ambisyon 2040, the government’s program for long-term economic growth.

The council made the resolution during its annual meeting with the theme, “Handog sa Pamantasan, Pag-alay sa Bayan”.  With resource person for the resolution, Secretary Arsenio Balisacan of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA). The meeting was held at the Ang Bahay ng Alumni in UP Diliman on August 18.

Balisacan, this year’s UPAA Most Distinguished Alumnus, explained Ambisyon 2040 in his UP Alumni Council Meeting lecture, “Social and Economic Transformation for Inclusive Philippine Development”. The program envisions human development as “matatag, maginhawa, at panatag”.

He emphasized that a “rapid, sustained, and inclusive growth is a necessary condition for the Philippines to become a predominantly middle-class society” by 2040. Balisacan spoke of a target annual growth rate of 6-8.5%.

While maintaining that the trick to growth is in the hands of the private sector, particularly through innovation and actively targeting bigger markets, government must raise its spending to achieve the targeted growth rates. Balisacan said government must sustain spending on infrastructure at 5-6% of GDP (gross domestic product). He said NEDA would continue monitoring and advising slow spenders in government.

Balisacan further highlighted the need for government to enhance society’s ecosystem for research and development and innovations, requiring, among others, robust partnership among government, private sector, and the academe.

The UP Alumni Council through Atty. Raul Reyes, the UPAA legal counsel and Chair of Council’s Resolution Committee, presented a draft of the resolution, which stated that the UPAA “will fully support the [NEDA’S] program for long-term economic growth called the Ambisyon 2040”.

It further resolved that the UPAA “will support and participate in the academe’s role in the government’s plan for social and economic transformation in order to raise the quality of investments vis-a-vis employment” and that it “will actively contribute to and encourage academic programs that will produce graduates who are eligible to provide efficient human capital to the government’s programs”.

The UP Alumni Council is composed of: University officials, deans and directors; past and present members of the UP Board of Regents; the current UPAA Board of Directors and the current officers of the UPAA chapters; the Distinguished Alumni Awardees; and other persons as may be designated by the UPAA Board of Directors.

It holds the annual meeting in order to draft and pass resolutions presented for endorsement to the general UPAA membership during the General Homecoming. These resolutions are then submitted to: the UP alumni in Congress and in the Senate for aid in legislation; the Board of Regents; and appropriate government and private agencies for reference in formulation of policies.

Hearing UP President Angelo Jimenez for probably the first time, the audience appeared to warm up to him as he did a roll call of the crowd by geographical origin. They also cheered most of the what he pointed to.

Jimenez briefed the students on the stereotypes.

“Aktibista daw ang mga taga-UP. Natural. We encourage activism. . . because we care. You care [about] what’s happening to your community, your society, your country, to the world. . . . You see something that needs to be changed, you do something to change it,” he said.

“They say you are radicals. Radical is root, di ba? Because you will be trained to look at the cause of the cause. . . until your mind is able to grasp the root causes,” he added.

But Jimenez also gave the students an early reality check.

“This University was really created to produce leaders of a very young nation over a hundred years ago. We succeeded so much. But after a hundred years, our society is still among the most unequal in the world. In Southeast Asia, we’re second most unequal. . . .

Constituent Universities’ Weekly Bulletin (Week 1)

(Week 1 | Updates as of 24 March 2020)

 

UP Diliman

One deceased, 2 tested negative for COVID-19 among UPD faculty

Four faculty members of UP Diliman registered as afflicted, person under investigation (PUI), and under monitoring for coming in from travel from a COVID-19-infested country or for being in direct contact with a COVID-19 patient.

One went straight to San Lazaro Hospital upon arrival in Manila on March 12, 2020 for a checkup after traveling to France to attend an academic conference. The faculty member tested positive and was confined in a medical quarantine facility, eventually passing away from complications from the disease.

Two were declared persons under investigation for showing symptoms after attending an academic conference in Japan. Tests on them revealed negative results.

Another faculty member was declared person under monitoring (PUM) after coming in direct contact with an individual with COVID-19.

 

Task force, measures set vs COVID-19

The UP Diliman administration created a task force on March 8, 2020 to draw up preventive measures and coping mechanisms on COVID-19 for students, faculty members, researchers, staff, and the UPD residents.

Headed by Chancellor Fidel Nemenzo, the task force is composed of officials and experts from the offices of the vice chancellors for academic, community, and student affairs, and for research and development; the University Registrar, Information Office, Health Service, the Office of Community Relations, Computerized Registration System; the colleges of Science, Law, and Social Sciences and Philosophy; the Institute for Small Scale Industries; and the University Student Council.

UPD set out to track all faculty members with travel history outside the Philippines in the 14 days before the community quarantine.

It adopted guidelines and mechanisms on where to go and what to do in case an individual or a dormer shows symptoms.

An information dissemination platform, upd.edu.ph/covid-19-advisory, was created. Information materials were also posted on the UPD website, Facebook, and Twitter pages. Smart Infocast was used for constituents who do not have access to the Internet.

Earlier, Nemenzo addressed the community a number of times through published and broadcasted statements, one immediately after the declaration of enhanced community quarantine of the National Capital Region on March 17, 2020, briefing the latter on the campus situation and actions.

 

Calls for donations issued for UP Diliman’s student volunteers, affected residents, and UPHS

Calls for donation have been made by UP Diliman on behalf of student volunteers for donations for affected campus residents; and by the UP Diliman Health Service for personal protective equipment (PPEs).

 

Alternatives proposed in UP Diliman in wake of class suspensions

UP Diliman identified several platforms such as the UPD Virtual Learning Environment (UVLE), Zoom, Google Classroom, and Microsoft Office as remote modes of learning in lieu of regular classes.

Colleges were asked to consider, evaluate, and suggest open-source versions as alternatives for their students.

Online classes endorsed earlier in lieu of regular classes were suspended along with regular classes in consideration of students without proper Internet and computer access.

 

UP Los Baños

UPLB brings stranded student-dormers home

The declaration of enhanced community quarantine over Luzon left many UP Los Baños (UPLB) students stranded in their dormitories, with no way to go back home.

The UPLB Administration established a system wherein parents of stranded UP dormers are contacted first for consent and to confirm address. The students are then ferried to their respective municipal halls at pre-arranged drop-off times, with the parents expected to be physically present receive their child. UPLB officials accompanying the students take pictures of the students with their parents to document that they are safe and have been delivered home without harm.

However, there is still a substantial number of stranded UPLB dormers still on-campus. As of March 21, 2020, there are still 517 students in the University dorms.

More is being done to help support and care for these remaining UPLB students. To find out, read here: SOS for stranded students

 

UPLB sends out a call for help for its student dormers

UP Los Baños currently has 106 student dorm-residents on campus, including international graduate students. Along with students staying in other housing facilities of partner institutions within campus, such as DMST, FNP, NCPC, YMCA and in SEARCA (International Graduate Students), a total of 623 students are staying in the UPLB dorms.

With the enhanced community quarantine, the normal canteens, cafeterias and eating places for these students have been closed, leaving the students with no food. The UPLB Administration sent out a call for donations to supply the UPLB students with food—at least P1.9 million a week for three meals a day for students inside and even outside the campus, who number over 900. Aside from food, students are also in need of vitamin C supplements to boost their immune system and protect their health.

 

UP Open University

UPOU launches portal for University COVID-19 updates

Inspired by the UP System’s portal for its COVID-19 updates, the UP Open University (UPOU) launched its own web portal on March 24.

It contains the updates from the UP System and UPOU’s own advisories, announcements, memoranda, and news, as well as emergency numbers that can be contacted by the community. Apart from the web portal, UPOU also sends out pertinent information to its community via email, social media, and MyPortal.

As early as March 9, UPOU has posted information materials on open and distance e-learning as an alternative to classroom-based education. And when there was a call to shift to online modes of education because of class suspensions due to the COVID-19 outbreak, UPOU conducted web seminars on the conversion to online classes.

While classes have since been suspended by the University, putting an end to the short-lived conduct of online classes by its constituent universities, UPOU’s purely-online classes have continued. As the leading open and distance e-learning institution in the country, UP President Danilo Concepcion referred to UPOU in its anniversary celebration last month as the “most high-tech” constituent in the UP System in terms of using information and communication technologies in teaching and learning.

Its administration, some faculty, and staff, who previously reported for work in their headquarters in Los Baños, Laguna as well as in learning centers across the country, have been rendering service from their homes.

UPOU’s learning materials may be accessed through its repository, UPOU Networks. Massive open online courses are also available at UPOU MODeL.

In a report submitted the UP System dated 24 March 2020, UPOU states that it conducted a survey in its community on COVID-19-related concerns and 62 responded. Of the 62, three students disclosed that they are persons under monitoring. A 34-year-old male abroad has finished his 14-day quarantine period at the time of his response. A 31-year-old female in the country said that she is being monitored daily by the Department of Health. And a 23-year-old female, also in the Philippines, is in self-quarantine.

 

UP Mindanao

UPMin to offer diagnostic program for free COVID-19 testing, models maximum possible no. of cases in Davao

UP Mindanao recently proposed a diagnostic program that can give free testing for COVID-19 in the Davao Region. The program includes establishing a Php15-million biosafety molecular lab that would be linked to a hospital. The proposal was authored by Philippine Genome Center (PGC) Mindanao director Dr. Lyre Anni Murao, who is also a professor of virology in UP Mindanao.

A recent, still-unpublished study on COVID-19 by Dr. May Anne Mata, a bioinformatics expert from UP Mindanao, shows the need to test even the asymptomatic patients. Dr. Mata’s research also discussed her disease model’s projection on the maximum possible number of cases in Davao, given the testing rate of 0.1% per day.

However, Dr. Mata’s research has found that if the testing rate were to increase from 70% to 100%, the number of COVID-19 carriers will reach 0 within a faster period compared to the current testing rate.

 

UP Baguio"
IN MEMORIAM: Remembering those we have lost – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/in-memoriam-remembering-those-we-have-lost/,"


They died alone, with no relatives around to hold their hands as they breathed their last. Some still have to be buried, and others were cremated with no ceremony and no one to bid them goodbye.

This has become the common tale of grief, sorrow and helplessness for the thousands all over the world who have fallen victim to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the story becomes even more poignant when it strikes closer to home or when the virus takes down somebody you love, somebody you know, or somebody you went to school with.

It was doubly tragic for the family of Dr. Dennis Ramon Tudtud, one of the eight University of the Philippines alumni who fought and died in the frontlines of the war against the vicious viral adversary. Dr. Tudtud, a prominent Cebu City oncologist, succumb to the virus on March 31, four days after his wife, Dr. Helen Evangelista Tudtud, a pathologist at the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center, expired after fighting the virus for 11 days.

Their son Dennis Thomas, recalled in a Facebook post the pain of losing both parents in span of four days. He told of how their family was discriminated against; how policemen cordoned off their neighborhood; how insensitive persons had reported his mother’s death even when she was still fighting for her life in the hospital; and how his mother had worried about her husband when she learned her condition was critical.

The virus, Dennis Jr. said, had made him an orphan on his birthday, ‘‘but I take comfort that they are happy together in their journey to paradise.’’

The eight UP alumni who fell in the frontlines of what has become a global war against the virus are:

1. Romeo Gregorio “Greg” N. Macasaet III (Died March 22, 2020)
2. Marcelo Y. Jaochico (March 24)
3. Raul D. Jara (March 24)
4. Francisco Avelino“Kiko” S. Lukban (March 25)
5. Salvacion“Sally” Rodriguez Gatchalian (March 26)
6. Raul D. Eslao (March 31)
7. Leandro L. Resurreccion III (March 31)
8. Dennis Ramon M. Tudtud (March 31)

Five other UP alumni have died from the virus. They are:

1. Nida Cortes Paqueo (March 11)
2. Aileen San Pablo Baviera (March 21)
3. Alan T. Ortiz (March 2)
4. Prudencio “Dennis” Regis (March 24)
5. Renato Velasco (April 4)

 

ROMEO GREGORIO MACASAET

Of the UP COVID-19 warriors, Dr. Greg Macasaet was the first to fall. An anesthesiologist at the Manila Doctors Hospital, he worked tirelessly to treat COVID-19 patients until he himself became ill. Soon after, his wife Evalyn, also an anesthesiologist, also tested positive for the virus. The two had been attending to COVID-19 patients in the emergency room, which was akin to soldiers engaging the enemy in a hand-to-hand combat.  Macasaet, according to his godson Renato Paraiso, made the ultimate sacrifice, “not because he was forced or obliged to do so, but because of his dedication to his craft and his constant devotion to be of service to others.” He said Greg and Evalyn chose to stay in the frontlines and made a bold sacrifice while their only child Raymond had special needs.

“Our country has lost a genuine hero, and the world has lost one of the [kindest and most] selfless human beings that would ever walk its surface,” Paraiso said. The Manila Doctors Hospital cited Macasaet as a “brave man, one of the best anesthesologists in the country.”

 

MARCELO JAOCHICO

When Dr. Marcelo Jaochico lost his heroic battle against the virus, he was being true to his vocation as “doctor to the barrios.” He was the provincial health officer of Pampanga and was the first awardee as Most Outstanding Doctor to the Barrios under the rural health program of the Department of Health. Thus, his daughter Cielo said in her Facebook page, Dr. Jaochico did not deserve to be regarded as than just a statistic.

Dr. Jaochico served as doctor to the barrio in Calanasan, Apayao for 16 years here he multi-tasked as obstetrician, pediatrician and family physician, treating such ailments as dengue, malaria and measles. Once, to save a baby who had turned blue after delivery, he used his mouth to suction the obstruction out of the baby’s blocked windpipe. In his latest rural health service, he volunteered to attend to victims of the Taal Volcano eruption in Batangas in January. He was also one of the first responders when Typhoon Yolanda struck in Tacloban City in 2013. “He did so much for the country,” his daughter wrote on Facebook.

 

RAUL D. JARA

Dr. Raul Jara, acknowledged as a pillar of cardiology in the Philippines, was also described by the Philippine Heart Association as a “father, teacher, mentor, poet, author, singer, colleague, friend.”He is remembered by patients as a soothing and calming healer who used music to heal the heart. In his younger days as an activist physician, he fought the dictator Ferdinand Marcos and risked his life by treating patients in the underground movement, running rings around the military by faking the names and records of the activists he treated. Later in life, he would remain steadfast and true to his oath, joining a group of doctors attending to an aging martial law figure who had been on the opposite end of the ideological spectrum.

In a statement, Dr. Ling Jara-Salva, one of Dr. Jara’s five children, said: “He dedicated his whole life to constant learning and teaching and molding future doctors. He would ask the tough questions and push you to learn and persevere. He believed in his students and would think of them as his children and the hope for the future generations.”

Her father, she said, was “a tower of strength and leadership and he served as the head of our family and a beacon of hope for many in the midst of this crisis. He knew the extensive battle he was facing and he kept on fighting.” She said the family would rather have her father remembered, not by how he died, but by how he lived.

 

FRANCISCO LUKBAN

Dr. Francisco Lukban was a noted geriatric cardiologist and a brilliant academician, according to the social media post of UP Manila’s Office of the Chancellor announcing his demise on March 25.

Always wanting to serve his fellowmen, he was much loved by his elderly patients at the Capitol Medical Center. Like many of the UP doctors of his generation, Dr. Kiko was a courageous activist, especially during the Martial Law days. “Kiko was not afraid to die… and would have loved to volunteer as a frontline physician in PGH in these trying times,” the UP Manila statement said. His wife, Riz, a pediatric neurologist and also a UP College of Medicine graduate, said Dr. Kiko, on the day he was swabbed for testing, expressed his desire to join the heroic young PGH interns who had volunteered to the frontline against COVID-19. Tragically, it was too late.

In a tribute, Riz Lukban said Dr. Kiko “had gone ahead of us because he believes he has a better chance of fighting COVID by being a ‘frontliner’ in heaven, giving supplication for us left behind.”

 

RAUL DELLA ESLAO

“I cannot stay at home, I’m a nurse” was a hashtag that went with his new profile picture in his final Facebook posting on March 19. Twelve days later Raul Della Eslao paid the ultimate price for his heroism. He died, a friend commented on Facebook, so others may live. A graduate of UP Integrated School, UP Diliman College of Architecture, and a registered nurse, he succumbed to the virus while fighting in the frontline in Michigan, USA where he worked.

 

SALVACION R. GATCHALIAN

As consultant and assistant director of the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, Dr. Salvacion “Sally” Gatchalian was not just in the frontline of the war against COVID-19. She was fighting in the trenches. A pediatric infectious disease expert, Doc Sally most likely acquired the virus from one of her young patients at RITM, the country’s premier testing center for COVID-19. She was president of the Philippine Pediatric Society.

The American Academy of Pediatrics cited her efforts in strengthening immunization and tobacco control and her work “to elevate pediatricians’ role in the Philippines and bring systemic changes to community norms and public policy.”Until a vicious nemesis called COVID-19 came to overcome her, much of Doc Sally’s life work was in defeating formidable adversaries like tuberculosis and dengue. Not only was she was a passionate advocate of child health; she was also a champion of children’s rights, lending a strong and vigorous voice to the campaign against the proposed legislation to lower the age of criminal liability among children.

“Her bright and cheerful presence could fill an entire room. From her patients and their families to her mentees, colleagues friends and family—they all loved her,” wrote Cathy Babao in the Philippine Daily Inquirer. A colleague and mentee described her as the “epitome of beauty and brains with a very big and generous heart.”

 

LEANDRO RESURRECCION III

“There were no hugs, there were no kisses, and there were no goodbyes.” That, according to the family of Dr. Leandro Resurreccion III, was how the country’s foremost and pioneering pediatric surgeon signed off in his fight against the virus.

To the very end, he was working on his vision for pediatric surgery, especially in liver transplants, according to the Philippine Children’s Medical Center, where he was chief of the Pediatric Surgery Division. He was the hospital’s “first fallen soldier in the battle against COVID-19.”

In a statement, the PCMC said Dr. Resurreccion was “well known locally and abroad as forward looking in his vision for pediatric surgery especially in liver transplants which he was working to the end. Always smiling, friendly and very ‘cool’ he will be missed.”

His son, Leandro IV, recalled that his father rejected an offer to practice in Australia after being certified at Westmead Hospital in Sydney, saying the Philippines was where he was needed most. “He always embodied a kind of fiery passion for his profession, but he always spoke of what the country needed together with such passion.”

 

DENNIS M. TUDTUD

Among the most tragic but heroic casualties of the global war against the pandemic are the husband-and-wife team of Dr. Dennis Ramon Tudtud and Dr. Helen Evangelista Tudtud. Dennis, a prominent Cebu oncologist, died on March 31, four days after Helen a pathologist at the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center, died, both victims the virus they so valiantly fought.

“My sister and I may never understand why God had to take them both. There are so many questions with no answers,” their son Dennis Thomas said. He asked for prayers for those who continue to fight for their lives against COVID-19.

“We have a flood of tears. I also ask for your prayers of strength and of acceptance. Daddy and Mommy, please watch over us from heaven,” he said. Dennis Thomas. “My parents touched many lives and were always at the forefront of helping other people.”

 

NIDA CORTES PACQUEO

She was “PH35” on the list of those who tested positive for the coronavirus in the Philippines. Yet, neither Nida Cortes Pacqueo nor her husband Vicente had been in any place where most victims were likely to catch the virus. A few days after her 67th birthday, PH35 became the first known Filipino to succumb to the virus. It was especially painful for their US-based daughter Liza, who, according to her blog, was talking to her mother on the phone when nurses in full protective gear took her mother away to the isolation room in the hospital. That video call on March 8 was the last time she saw her mother. Three days later, on March 11, “she died in the silence of isolation.”

“She died alone without her loving family and friends around her. She was cremated alone, without ceremony or tribute. My father is alone as well,” Liza announced on Facebook.

Her father, Dr. Vicente Pacqueo, a former World Bank economist and UP economics professor, also had the virus and was in isolation when his wife of 47 years died. As of Liza’s latest post, the 72-year old patriarch of the family was stable and probably well on his way to recovery.

 

AILEEN SAN PABLO BAVIERA

The country’s top China expert, Dr. Aileen San Pablo Baviera, was coming home on March 12 from an engagement in France, but she never made it home. From the airport, she was taken straight to the San Lazaro Hospital where she succumbed to COVID-19 nine days later. As political science professor and former dean of the UP Asian Center, Dr. Baviera was one of the country’s foremost experts in international relations and Asian studies. While she was a staunch advocate of Philippine-China relations, she insisted that, “if one has to take a side, one must take the side of the Filipino people.”

As a keen China watcher, she was an expert on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, especially as it applied to Chinese incursions into the West Philippine Sea. She described herself as ”an academic, an armchair activist, a government analyst, an author, an editor, a policy adviser, a public speaker on international relations, an advocate of people’s diplomacy, a keen observer of global affairs—sometimes nationalist, sometimes internationalist.”

Once, on a cruise on the East China Sea, Dr. Baviera pondered on the overlapping territorial interests of the countries claiming all or part of the China Sea—China, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines and other Southeast Asian states. She wrote: “It seems that governments have let their primordial territorial instincts rule them. There is folly in this. They seek control of the waters, as if oceans could be tamed, claimed and fenced off like the land. In truth, no one knows exactly what they are claiming….I envy the free creatures of the sea, for we creatures of the land have become captive of our own illusions of conquest and control.”

UP Diliman

Bayanihan spirit swells for constituents

Individuals, organizations, and university units offered services, facilities, and resources to help UP constituents cope with the COVID-19 pandemic and the enhanced community quarantine.

UP alumna Shamcey Supsup-Lee headed Miss Universe Philippines in donating food to stranded students through the Pedro and Coi’s “Biyaheng Busog” program. In a separate initiative, Bounty Fresh donated 1,000 kilos of chicken to the stranded dormers and personnel on campus.

The University Food Service for its part remained open to provide meals for stranded dormers and student athletes.

For students, the faculty, and staff, the UPD Psychosocial Services started offering “telepsychotherapy”. COVID-19 frontliners can avail of the services for free, after signing up at bit.ly/PsycServ, or calling 09167573157, or emailing psycserve.upd@up.edu.ph.

Journalist and faculty member Kara David distributed 200 washable face masks and alcohol refill to household helpers, street sweepers, security guards, grocery workers, and vegetable sellers.

The College of Fine Arts housed 100 Lumad children in its new building. The Bakwit School teachers, however, expressed apprehension over their limited supplies and social distancing.

 

Constituents stepping up aid to frontliners, patients

Academic units are reaching out to one another, to the COVID-19 frontliners, and to government in fighting the COVID-19 menace.

The College of Engineering (CoE) created a COVID-19 response team headed by Dean Ferdinand Manegdeg, and is currently raising funds and resources for its proposals. These include:

 

3D Printing for frames of face shields for frontliners using CoE 3D printers to be pooled in the EEEI building.
Designing a prototype adult ventilator for quick and cost-effective production.
Tracking high-risk individuals in coordination with government agencies and telecommunciation companies.
Fabricating a mobile plasma treatment apparatus, in coordination with UP Manila (UPM) College of Medicine and Philippine General Hospital (PGH), to disinfect buildings, utilities, and equipment.
Fabricating a cleaning chamber prototype that will be used to disinfect used personnel protective equipment (PPEs) using UV light.

 

CoE also proposed a project for the Patient and Health Care Worker Flow for PGH, a PGH COVID-19 Donation Tracking System, and a Knowledge Center, according to Technology Transfer and Business Development Office Director Luis Sison.

At the same time, UPD is collaborating with UPM and alumni in the De La Salle University faculty to provide coveralls, headgear disinfection, “SaniPod”, a negative pressure system, disinfection of PPEs, disinfection of intubation kits and telemonitoring team, a telepresence triage, telemetry of admitted patients, and teletracking of sent-home patients.

The College of Science (CS) reported providing assistance in COVID-19 testing through its equipment and personnel; and the College of Human Kinetics (CHK), to frontliners through production of “sanitents” or sanitation tents.

Some CoE, College of Fine Arts, and CS alumni designed sanitents to be used in hospitals and establishments, composed of PVC pipes, plastic cover, and matting. The design and chemical solution was being finalized.

The Department of Public Works and Highways has chosen UPD open areas as one of the plots for installation of prototype tents.

UP Cebu FabLab and other FabLabs in the Visayas race to produce face shields for medical frontliners

Around March 23, 2020, the UP Cebu FabLab began designing and 3D-printing face shield frames to contribute to the supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) desperately needed by medical frontliners in the war against COVID-19.

The team of faculty members and staff at the UP Cebu FabLab who have been making the face shields consist of College of Communication, Art, and Design dean Prof. Palmy Marinel Tudtud, Prof. Mona Alcudia, Prof. Jay Nathan Jore, Fidel Laurence Ricafranca, Mark Argel Simacon, and Prof. Raymund Fernandez. The face shield frames they make using a laser cutter is attached to a sheet of plastic or acetate to create a face shield to protect frontliners against the coronavirus.

According to an email interview with UP Cebu Information Officer Vanessa Guerrero, the UP Cebu FabLab belongs to a network of fabrication laboratories where technology and innovation is shared. “Together with other Fablabs in the Visayas, the UP Cebu FabLab joined the community of maker-spaces in developing and producing PPEs for our brave Filipino medical frontliners working through the COVID-19 pandemic. UP FabLab opted to do the face shield as its materials can be easily sourced and mass production can be done fast and efficiently,” she said.

The UP Cebu’s face-shield production was initially backed by funds from UP Cebu Education and Research Foundation, Inc. (UPCERFI) and the laboratory’s own resources. The UP Cebu FabLab is being supplied materials by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). The aim, according to Guerrero, is to produce 500 face shields per week.

But with the increasing number of requests for face shields from hospitals and frontliners in Cebu, the UP Cebu FabLab has joined forces with the other FabLabs across the Visayas. “The need is overwhelming, and what we need now is to collectively help produce PPEs,” said Guerrero.

Donations and other forms of assistance continue to pour in for UP students stranded in campus and off-campus housing.

Food, hygiene needs, and even transport going home are being facilitated by University offices and concerned groups and organizations. Members of the UP community across its constituent universities—alumni, students, faculty, administration, and staff—as well as private individuals, businesses, government units, and the armed forces have been pitching in to help.

In UP Diliman (UPD), the administration has called for donations and volunteers. The University Food Service remains in operation to prepare meals for dormitory residents on campus and donations of ingredients are being received. UPD psychosocial services are still being provided through PsycServ. The mode of counseling has been shifted from face-to-face to online.

The UPD University Student Council (USC), meanwhile, launched IskoOps: COVID-19 to help not only the more than 250 students, but also the vendors and jeepney drivers affected by the enhanced community quarantine.

Oplan Kawingan and Oplan Hatid were initiated in UP Los Baños (UPLB). There are 517 students in University-administered dormitories, 106 in UPLB partner institution housing facilities on campus, and more than 900 who live off-campus. UPLB needs at least P1.9 million per week to provide three meals per day to all of its stranded students.

Oplan Kawingan is a food drive from the consolidated effort of UPLB, Every Nation Campus, Serve the People Brigade Task Force Community Unit Response, Chelsea’s, volunteers, and independent contractors, with support from Barangay Batong Malake.

The UPLB Dairy Training and Research Institute delivered and has committed to deliver milk and white cheese to the campus dorms twice a week. The Institute of Plant Breeding has also provided produce to the dorm residents. Those stranded continue to be the beneficiaries of alumni as well as organizations like the UPLB USC, UPLB All UP Academic Employees Union, Bounty Agro Ventures Inc., and Art Relief Mobile Kitchen, among others.

The call of those who wanted to go home was also heeded through Oplan Hatid. As of March 23, 94 students have been reunited with their families through the initiative of UPLB, UP Rural High School Alumni Group, and the Armed Forces of the Philippines Second Battalion.

Hygiene kits and other essentials have also been received and the University continues to provide stable internet connectivity so students can remain in contact with their families and relatives.

The University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital (UP-PGH) has been designated by the Department of Health (DOH) as one of the three COVID-19 referral centers in the National Capital Region (NCR), with the concurrence of UP President Danilo L. Concepcion and UP Manila Chancellor Carmencita D. Padilla.

The director of UP-PGH, Dr. Gerardo “Gap” Legaspi, made this announcement during a March 23 virtual press conference of the DOH.

The other two hospitals designated as COVID-19 referral centers in the NCR are the Dr. Jose M. Rodriguez Memorial Hospital in Caloocan City and the Lung Center of the Philippines in Quezon City.

 

Preparing for a potentially protracted battle

Government hospitals under the DOH, major private hospitals, and the different offices of the DOH were tasked with coordinating the management of the COVID-19 public health emergency, Dr. Legaspi said.

“The stakeholders agreed that one of the solutions to this complex problem was to organize the hospitals in a manner that will rationalize the clinical approach and the utilization of resources in order to equip and enable the designated referral centers for a potentially protracted battle,” the UP-PGH statement added.

Representatives of the hospitals, both private and government, met and discussed the issues and have committed financial, manpower, technical and technological assistance to the three COVID-19 referral centers. The DOH and the University of the Philippines also pledged to extend full support.

The statement added that “a scaling-up system of preparation was agreed upon so as not to severely hamper the COVID-19 referral centers’ services to their currently admitted patients.”"

Preparations have been completed, and on March 30, the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital (UP-PGH) begins operations as a COVID-19 referral center.

According to UP-PGH director Dr. Gerardo “Gap” Legaspi, readying the UP-PGH to accept COVID-19-positive patients was a joint effort by the University of the Philippines, the public sector through the Department of Health (DOH) and with the help of DOH-retained hospitals, and the private sector, including the construction industry and St. Luke’s Medical Center.

Speaking during the official launch of the UP-PGH Bayanihan Na! COVID-19 Operations Center on March 30 from the Nurses Home, PGH Compound in UP Manila, Director Legaspi gave a brief report on the preparations undertaken by the hospital, which began on March 23. [Watch the livestream here]

“Sa isang linggo po ay na-convert ang anim na bahagi ng ospital para tumanggap ng mga pasyenteng COVID. [In one week, we converted six sections of the hospital to ready them to receive COVID patients],” Director Legaspi said during his message to the UP community and the public.

Partners in the private sector

He thanked their partners in the private sector who helped with the daunting task of retrofitting two wards in the UP-PGH into a facility able to handle COVID-19 patients. The retrofitting of the wards was completed in record time by the DM Consunji, Inc. (DMCI), with the help of Architect Dan Lichauco, founding partner and principal architect of Manila-based Archion Architects.

An article published by the Philippine Star quotes a statement by DMCI president and chief executive officer Jorge Consunji: “We thank our workers who rose to the challenge of delivering this project on time and in accordance with social distancing and sanitation protocols. We also commend the management of the UP-PGH, architect Dan Lichauco and Bloomberry Foundation for supporting our workers.”

Director Legaspi also reiterated that an initial 130 beds with ICU units have been dedicated for COVID-positive patients “para po mas maganda at organisadong-organisado ang paggagamot ng mga COVID-19 patients, at pinaka-importante po, mas safe sa ating mga health workers [so that treatment of COVID-19 patients will be effective and organized and, most importantly, our health workers will remain safe.]”"

The UP Diliman College of Science (UPD-CS) expressed its appreciation for its constituents who are actively helping the country respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In a Facebook post, the College enumerated their efforts, which include lending equipment for COVID-19 testing, producing personal protective equipment (PPEs), donating supplies for frontliners and public hospitals, modeling disease transmission and ventilator production, and deploying personnel to testing centers.

“In this time of crisis, we are all called to help our fellow countrymen. The College is lucky to have students, faculty, researchers and staff who are willing to lend a hand in any way they can,” the Facebook post dated March 23, time-stamped 6:47 PM, said.

“All these efforts are being done because our standing mandate as UP scientists is to make science serve the people. We offer our expertise, services, and laboratories to the Filipino people in the hope of providing solutions to our current crisis,” CS Associate Dean Lillian Jennifer Rodriguez told the UP Media and Public Relations Office.

Experienced personnel

According to Rodriguez, the Institute of Biology (IB) and the National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (NIMBB) of the College have been tapped by both public and private sectors for experienced personnel who can be trained to perform COVID-19 tests.

“We are proud of our people who will be joining the frontline in the fight against this virus,” the College’s Facebook post read. It added that the personnel will be trained for accreditation by the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) of the Department of Health (DOH) before deployment to different testing centers.

“We are asking the UP Diliman community and the Filipino people to please pray for their safety,” the College said.

Meanwhile, Dr. AC Yago and Dr. Emily Castriciones of the Institute of Chemistry (IC) have been tapped by the Quezon City local government for advice on disinfection and cleaning strategies.

Equipment for COVID-19 testing

“The NIMBB, through Dr. Rey Garcia, and the Natural Sciences Research Institute (NSRI), through Dr. Cora de Ungria, have lent or will be lending their qPCR machines to satellite testing centers,” Rodriguez said. The machines are needed side by side with the test kits currently being used by the RITM.

To ensure the quality of the tests, these qPCR machines are recalibrated by CS personnel upon transfer to the satellite testing centers, Rodriguez added.

PPE and supplies

At the National Institute of Physics(NIP), CS Dean Giovanni Tapang leads 3D printing of disposable face shields for donation to public hospitals. He is also trying out designs to facilitate the printing.

“We also have Dr. Chelo Pascua and Dr. Cherry Ringor working with Dr. Mahar Lagmay and UP Resilience Institute (UPRI) on the 3D printing of face masks,” Tapang said.

Laboratories of the IB, IC, NIMBB, NSRI, and Marine Science Institute (MSI) are also donating supplies needed by public hospitals and frontliners. These include surgical masks, gloves, and disinfectants such as alcohol and bleach.

“We have donated a first batch of these supplies to the UP Health Service, a second batch to PGH [Philippine General Hospital],” Dr. Rodriguez reported. “We have a third batch that we will most likely give to either PGH or RITM.”"

UP united: How the state university is raising head and heart against COVID-19 – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/up-united-how-the-state-university-is-raising-head-and-heart-against-covid-19/,"


As expected of the country’s national university, the University of the Philippines has been among the main institutions at the forefront of the battle against the coronavirus. The spirit of honor, excellence and compassion shines brightly among faculty, students, alumni, and staff across constituent universities nationwide.

There is the selfless courage of those who continue to serve daily in the Philippine General Hospital (PGH), or as PGH Director Dr. Gerardo Legaspi aptly puts it, the “people giving hope.” Despite a directive to pull out interns from medical colleges, about 214 PGH interns have volunteered to stay on duty, assisting and augmenting the hospital’s health workers. Despite the danger, PGH has accepted the appointment as one of the country’s COVID-19 referral hospitals.

 

Aiming for more tests

In the search for solutions, there are minds hard at work at the UP National Institutes of Health and the Philippine Genome Center (PGC). Scientist Dr. Raul Destura has called on laboratories and hospitals for proper equipment to test their locally developed SARS-COV 2 detection kits. According to UP’s National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, the search for equipment and qualified personnel to properly conduct tests will be in preparation for the expanded testing of the Department of Health (DOH). Completion of field tests over a two- to three-week period may allow these more affordable test kits to be readily available.

Increasing the testing capacity for coronavirus in other regions has also been stressed by UP Mindanao’s (UPM) PGC. Its director, virology professor Dr. Lyre Anni Murao, has proposed a diagnostic program for free testing of COVID-19. Currently in Mindanao, only the Southern Philippines Medical Center (SPMC) is capable of running the test. The proposal includes building a biosafety molecular lab attached to a hospital that will not only help the region against COVID-19 but can eventually help against other infectious and emerging diseases.

 

Discussions ongoing about the establishment of a COVID-19 testing lab in the Davao Regional Medical Center in Tagum City. Involved are Dr. Lyre Anni Murao, director of the Philippine Genome Center-Mindanao, and the DRMC team, led by chief of hospital Dr. Bryan Dalid and pathologist Dr. Alejandro Domingo. Additional testing labs are an urgent requirement of local governments and the Department of Health to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in the Philippines. Photos from Dr. Murao, taken from a UP Mindanao Facebook post, April 6

 

Ideas and more

Over at the UP Diliman College of Engineering (CoE), a meeting of minds converged to find engineering solutions to the virus outbreak. Five feasible proposals with immediate benefits were identified.

The first project pools together all 3D printers across the university system for the production of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).

Second is the development of a prototype adult ventilator, as COVID-19 is essentially a respiratory illness. Third is a movement tracker in conjunction with government agencies and telcos for registered Persons Under Investigation. The tracking solution will help assess possible contamination in an area.

Fourth is the creation of a mobile plasma treatment apparatus for the disinfection of hospital walls, ERs, walkways, PPEs, health utilities like air filters, and office equipment. Last is a prototype cleaning chamber based on ultraviolet exposure that can disinfect used PPEs.

Project implementation will be conducted in coordination with the UP Engineering Research and Development Foundation, Inc. (UPERDFI) and UP Alumni Engineers (UPAE). The UPERDFI has called for donations as the projects will have a total cost of over P1.6 million. The cause has led to generous donations in both cash and kind, including the donation of electronic equipment and devices for prototype and fabrication works.

Dr. Enrique Ostrea, Jr. (UP Med’65), patent holder of a ventilator for newborns, has waived his right to the patent to shorten the prototype development of the proposed adult ventilator.

 

Facing the shortages

With the shortage of masks and safety equipment, UP units in the Visayas have also used their creativity and resourcefulness to help. The UP Cebu Fabrication Laboratory (FabLab), built for the Product Design program in partnership with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) Cebu, has used a 3D printer and laser cutter to come up with about 100 face shields. Additional materials from DTI are expected for more face shields to be made.

Students at UP Visayas (UPV) in Miagao and Iloilo campuses have initiated a project to mass-produce alternative face shields. Based on a design from a health worker at the Iloilo Mission Hospital, the face shield is made from Velcro straps, acetate sheets, craft foam and PVC covers. Both campuses are accepting donations of materials including adhesives, double-sided tapes, staples and staplers.

The students have so far produced 300 face shields that have been distributed to hospitals across Iloilo. They hope to make many more for the Western Visayas Sanitarium, which is being eyed as a COVID-19 center for the province.

Volunteers were mobilized from among many dormers still in the UPV campuses. Because of travel restrictions to Manila and other provinces, about 174 students remain stranded. Fellow students and alumni groups have been donating food and supplies, especially as the Miagao campus is about 42 kms south of Iloilo City.

UPV, through its Philippine Genome Center Visayas, has also transferred its PCT Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) machine and its Digital Dry Bath to the Western Visayas Medical Center. With these transfers, Iloilo City becomes better equipped to diagnose the disease. An alumni group from UPV has also met with government officials to push for the establishment of an accredited coronavirus testing center in the city.

 

Stranded students

In the meantime, UP Los Baños (UPLB) has experienced a similar plight to UPV and has appealed for help. The campus has been providing supplies to 700 students in university dorms and another 900 in off-campus housing facilities. The university needs at least P2 million a week to help feed the students.

UPLB recently concluded Oplan Hatid in partnership with the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) 2nd Battalion, the UP Rural High School Alumni Group and the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs. Some 94 UPLB students were reunited with their families in CALABARZON and across NCR.

Some UPLB dormers, such as those from the Women’s Residence Hall, have decided to be productive about their stay. Difficult as it is to find food and supplies, the residents have managed to make 100 DIY face shields in a project initiated by the School of Environmental Science and Management. Beta Sigma-UPLB chapter has called for volunteers to make more face shields as their group provides instruction guides and raw materials.

Aside from face shields, the UP community has been looking at other equipment. A group of designers, engineers and chemists from UP Diliman have put together a prototype COVID-19 decontamination tent. The group, called SaniTents PH, said it could guide hospitals and other establishments who want to increase their safety protocols against the disease. The booth can be constructed in one and a half days, and features a diffuser that sprays disinfectant from head to toe.

SaniTents PH has released the design for the general public, so that it can be freely copied or modified for use."

The east wing of the newly renovated UP Asian Institute of Tourism (AIT) building located along Commonwealth Avenue is now COVID-19 Testing Center of Quezon City District 6.

“When a request for assistance in setting up a COVID-19 testing center in Quezon City was received from [District 6 Representative] Kit Belmonte by [UP Diliman] Chancellor Fidel Nemenzo, an affirmative response was immediately given after consultations with [UP] President Danilo Concepcion and myself as the head of unit of the building that was identified as the suitable location for the purpose,” UP-AIT Dean Leticia Susan Lagmay-Solis told the UP Media and Public Relations Office.

For testing operations that would begin on April 20, 2020, an ocular inspection of what used to be the AIT House Hotel was undertaken on April 17, 2020 by Belmonte and QC Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (DRRM) Head Karl Marasigan, together with personnel from the UP Diliman (UPD) Office of the Vice Chancellor for Planning and Development, the UPD Office of the Campus Architect, and UP-AIT.

They addressed operational concerns and identified the most efficient way of setting up the facility at the soonest possible time. This included clearing the areas of furniture and equipment and disinfecting the internal and external areas of the building on April 18, 2020.

Thus, the center was set up, with booths and paraphernalia coming from the LGU, within two days after the request from the city; and was operating on the third.

UP sets guidelines on proceeding with academic year affected by the ECQ – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/up-sets-guidelines-on-proceeding-with-academic-year-affected-by-the-ecq/,"


 

The University of the Philippines released on 23 April 2020 implementing guidelines for proceeding with the Second Semester of Academic Year 2019-2020, which has been affected by the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) in Luzon and other parts of the country.

The guidelines, issued by UP President Danilo L. Concepcion, reflect the resolution of the UP Board of Regents (BOR) in its special meeting on 16 April 2020. The resolution was based on the 13 April 2020 recommendations of UP’s President’s Advisory Committee (PAC) which, in turn, were drawn from the recommendations of the UP System Academic Affairs Committee that were based on the decisions of the Constituent Universities’ Executive Committees in consultation with College Secretaries, Graduate Program Coordinators, Deans and faculty. The PAC endorsed the following proposed policy on the Second Semester AY 2019-2020 to the BOR: 1) end the semester on 30 April 2020; 2) assure that students will not fail the course but that their grade of P (Pass) with optional adjectival remarks will be deferred until they meet adjusted course requirements by 31 May 2021; and 3) allow earlier completion of requirements by students on a CU-set deadline.

Guided equally by the UP’s mandate as the National University committed to quality education and by the extreme conditions confronting its students and faculty during the ECQ in Luzon and other parts of the country, the BOR adopted the PAC-proposed “Policy on the Second Semester AY 2019-2020 in the time of COVID-19”, dated 13 April 2020, with revision. Specifically, the Board replaced the recommended P (Pass with optional adjectival remarks) with numeric grades and granted units offering graduate courses the leeway to determine how best to proceed with learning and assessment, in consultation with their students and in consideration of the current crisis situation.

The Academic Year and deadlines

The last day of class for the semester is 30 April 2020.

The CUs will set a deadline for faculty members to disseminate the adjusted course requirement to all their students. Faculty members who are unable to reach some students may seek the assistance of the College Secretaries of the students’ home unit.

The CUs will also set the deadline, allowing sufficient time, for the earlier completion within the semester of adjusted course requirements by graduating students and other students who may opt for this.

The end dates indicated in the approved academic calendar—such as for the submission of grades and University Council meetings for graduating students—will be revised by the CUs for approval by the UP President.

The CUs may decide on proceeding with Midyear 2020 on a schedule informed by ongoing assessments of the COVID-19 situation. In any case, Midyear 2020 should be seen as an opportunity to offer bridging programs.

Academic activities after 30 April 2020

There will be no face-to-face classes for the rest of the academic year for both undergraduate and graduate programs. Due to internet access issues that will be addressed in the next semester, online classes are discouraged, but may be conducted only for leveling expectations, clarifications, overall guidance, and summation. Real-time online meetings should not impact grading and should be recorded and disseminated to all students concerned.

Units offering laboratory, studio, PE, NSTP, and similar courses are free to redesign the course and explore options to facilitate the completion of these courses remotely.

Adjusted course requirements may take the form of an examination or alternative forms of summative assessment (e.g. reflection paper or critical analysis) to be scheduled by the units based on the CU deadline for earlier completion.

As a sit-down proctored final examination may no longer be feasible, online exams may be administered. For this, the platform to be used, the students’ internet connection, and their psychological preparedness to take the exam online must be considered.

Graduate programs are strongly encouraged to adopt or conform with the general framework, rationale and guidelines on the conduct of academic exercises, as contained in the BOR Resolution. Units offering or handling graduate programs may opt to adopt the policies in this section.

Grading

No student will be given a grade of 4.0, 5.0 or INC for courses in the Second Semester AY 2019-2020.

Students may elect to drop at any time and re-enroll their courses or re-enroll in alternative elective courses or equivalent courses in succeeding semesters. DRP given for the Second Semester AY 2019-2020 will be annotated in the Transcript of Records with an asterisk to indicate: due to COVID-19.

Students may also choose not to pursue, in any way, their enrolled courses for the Second Semester AY 2019-2020, as long as they inform in writing their registrar, through their dean, of this choice at any time before 31 May 2021. The students will be deemed dropped as of that date and will not receive grades for these courses in their transcript of records. They will be allowed to re-enroll their courses or equivalent courses in the succeeding semesters.

Faculty members who have sufficient basis to give their students a grade as of the end of the semester must give a numeric grade to students with passing status and a deferred grade to those failing or incomplete. The latter have until 31 May 2021 to complete the adjusted course requirements.

“When faculty members are unable to perform their academic function due to the COVID- 19 crisis, their respective units, out of duty and compassion for the faculty members concerned and their students, shall ensure that those who comply with the adjusted requirements of the course are given a grade.”

Where there is no sufficient basis for giving students a grade as of the end of the semester, grades will be deferred. Again, students have up to 31 May 2021 to complete the adjusted course requirements.

Upon completion, the faculty will give a numeric grade to students who have complied with the adjusted course requirements, or drop the students unable to comply for whatever reason, whose performance is unsatisfactory or whose status is failing. The latter may re-enroll the same course or equivalent subject in succeeding semesters.

Numeric grade exemption

A unit, on behalf of its faculty members, may file applications for exemption from the provisions of the UP System policy of imposing only a numeric grading system in the Second Semester AY 2019-2020.

The application should be justified and limited to seeking authority to give P (Pass) as a grade with the faculty having the option to give numeric grades to students whose circumstances so require.

Applications must be filed on or before 15 May 2020 through the chancellors, who will then endorse them to the UP President through the Office of the Vice-President for Academic Affairs for eventual consideration of the BOR.

Academic standing and scholarship

The University is waiving academic deadlines on scholastic standing and student financial assistance for this semester. The deadlines for dropping subjects and filing leave of absence for this semester have also been lifted.

Flexibility and compassion. These were the key takeaways in the first episode of UP Open University’s (UPOU) podcast series, “Edu-Hack: Navigating through a Turbulent Educational Landscape” on April 28.

The discussion centered on answering the question, “How are Philippine Universities Responding to Disruptions in Education Brought About by COVID-19 Pandemic?”

The panelists were UPOU Chancellor Melinda Bandalaria, University of Batangas (UB) Vice President for Academic Affairs Abegayle Chua, and De La Salle University (DLSU) Association of Faculty and Educators President Antonio Contreras.

This year saw Southern Luzon and Metro Manila being hit with back-to-back crises, with the phreatomagmatic eruption of Taal Volcano in January and the COVID-19 pandemic in March. For the education sector, it meant multiple weeks-long class suspensions. While the institutions to which the panelists belonged had online learning systems in place, Chua said it best: “No one was prepared for this kind of lockdown.”

UPOU started shifting to online classes in 2001 and its classes were fully online by 2007, so Bandalaria said that the University initially assumed things would be business as usual. But she admitted the quarantine brought up issues beyond the usual open and distance e-learning operations. Anxiety, stress, accessibility, work-school scheduling, and health risks were some of the concerns raised by faculty, staff, and students alike."
"COVID-19, ECQ, and Crash Landing on You – University of the Philippines",https://up.edu.ph/covid-19-ecq-and-crash-landing-on-you/,"


Question: How does one explain the COVID-19 crisis from a governance perspective in an easily digestible and palatable manner?

Answer: Use a popular web series for parallelism.

 

Screenshot taken of Dr. Kristoffer Berse’s talk, “Crash Landing on ECQ: Crisis Leadership and Accountability in COVID-19 Philippines”

 

This was what Dr. Kristoffer Berse did in his talk, “Crash Landing on ECQ: Crisis Leadership and Accountability in COVID-19 Philippines.” It was organized by the Master of Management Program of the UP Open University (UPOU) Faculty of Management and Development Studies in partnership with the Association of Schools of Public Administration in the Philippines, Inc. as part of UPOU’s “Let’s Talk It Over” online lecture series.

Berse is a faculty member of the UP Diliman National College of Public Administration and Governance. He is also the director for Research and Creative Work at the UP Resilience Institute and part of the UP COVID-19 Pandemic Response Team.

What constitutes a crisis? Threat, uncertainty, and urgency, Berse said. When South Korean heiress Yoon Se-ri finds herself hanging from a tree on the wrong side of the border, following a paragliding mishap, all three elements are present. All three elements are present in this COVID-19 pandemic as well. Both illustrate the threat to life and safety, the uncertainty of survival with or without injury and repercussion, and the urgency to deal with the threat.

He said there were four ways to respond to a threat: tolerate, terminate, treat, or transfer. One can just accept the losses due to the threat, do something to eliminate the threat, mitigate the impacts of the threat, or share the impacts of the threat. And the response could be a combination of those.

In the series, Se-ri removes the threat to her life and safety by deciding to get off the tree, and ends up in the arms of Ri Jeong-hyeok, captain of North Korea’s Special Police Force. Berse likened Se-ri to the Philippines wanting to eliminate the threat of COVID-19 and the landing in Jeong-hyeok’s arms as the resulting enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) that broke the fall. Minus the kilig factor, of course.

 

Dr. Kristoffer Berse delivers his lecture, “Crash Landing on ECQ: Crisis Leadership and Accountability in COVID-19 Philippines”

 

Delving deeper into the Philippine government’s response to COVID-19, Berse said it adopted a “whole of government” approach. He then zeroed in on one of the national action plan’s objectives. That is, to “prevent, contain, and/or eliminate the spread of COVID-19.”

“Is the ECQ effective?” Berse asked. The answer was not a simple yes or no. Using available data at the national level, he showed the UP COVID-19 Pandemic Response Team’s “Time-Varying Reproduction Number of the Philippines” graph as of May 5, 12:49am. In it, the average transmission over a period of time by infected individuals is a little over one."

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind the COVID-19 pandemic, is well-known for causing respiratory problems. However, the virus does not only attack the lungs but targets other organs as well.

As UP College of Medicine professor and Philippine Nephrology Society vice president Dr. Elizabeth Montemayor said: “Patients with kidney problems are a very special group of patients who will need very special attention.”

Dr. Montemayor delivered her talk on “COVID-19 and the Kidneys” during the fourth installment of the UP “Stop COVID Deaths: Clinical Management Updates”, which was held on May 15, with replay available on the TVUP YouTube channel.

She discussed four different kinds of patients with kidney disease who are especially vulnerable to COVID-19: patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD); patients who have had kidney transplants; patients who are on hemodialysis; and patients who have developed acute kidney injury (AKI).

According to Dr. Montemayor, patients with Chronic Kidney Disease have a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19. “This should be emphasized, because CKD patients should be advised to take extra precautions to minimize risk of exposure to the virus. Doctors engaged in the care of CKD patients should be really monitoring them for timely detection of disease progression,” she said.

She also discussed the effect of the virus on ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) receptors in the kidneys, and the use of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, which are used to treat hypertension and to prevent kidney failure in patients with diabetes."

In the fifth presentation of the UP webinar series,“STOP COVID DEATHS: Clinical Management Updates,” on May 22, 2020, Dr. Rontgene M. Solante, head of the Adult Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine unit of the San Lazaro Hospital, shared valuable insights from their care and management of COVID-19 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and other infections.

The San Lazaro Hospital is a 500-bed infectious diseases referral hospital and is one of the 31 subnational referral laboratories for COVID-19. It is also an HIV treatment hub, DOTS and multidrug-resistant TB referral hospital. It was the hospital that admitted the first two COVID-19 cases in the Philippines on January 23, 2020.

Dr. Solante, one of the Philippines’ top experts on infectious diseases, discussed how the hospital is managing COVID-19 cases and is participating in the World Health Organization (WHO) Solidarity Trial for interventions using investigational drugs, wherein hospitals in more than 70 countries compare treatment options to assess effectiveness against COVID-19.

In Solante’s presentation on COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, dengue was shown as the top case admitted in San Lazaro, followed by tetanus, TB, and others. He explained that anybody who is admitted with fever now has to be tested for COVID-19. “We have to look at the history and findings of respiratory tract infections. Focusing on COVID, we now have a total of 88 confirmed cases (as of May 14). Most of the deaths (total of 19) were of males 50 years old and abovewho died due to sepsis or acute respiratory disease syndrome,” he said.

Dr. Solante said the patient’s age is a major risk factor of determinant for survival, as well as patients who are immunocompromised, with TB or other infections or comorbidities. The majority of those who died have comorbidities, with hypertension as the most common, followed by diabetes, which also reflect the findings from COVID-19 research in China. He added that there were also patients who died with influenza B, streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus hominis bacteremia.

Dr. Solante explained that the radiographic findings for 16 of those who died showed that they had bilateral pneumonia and two had lobar pneumonia. Some of their Chest CT (Computed Tomography) findings showed ground glass opacification, but most showed none. The RT-PCR test must always be used in detecting COVID cases, he added.

Interventions using investigational drugs

Dr. Solante said that as part of the solidarity clinical trial for COVID-19 treatments, the San Lazaro hospital is among those that test the following investigational drugs for inhibiting viral replication or entry, and for preventing receptor activation of inflammatory molecules: remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir with interferon beta-1a, chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, and tocilizumab. He said the use of tocilizumab on selected patients showed significant improvements seen in radiologic and chest CT results. However, extra care should be done to prevent the use of these drugs that would have interaction or effects on other medications needed by the patients, he explained.

Air quality after ECQ far from ‘new normal’ expectations – UPD experts – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/air-quality-after-ecq-far-from-new-normal-expectations-upd-experts/,"


Experts from the University of the Philippines Diliman College of Science and College of Engineering are looking at the positive impact of the enhanced community quarantine on air quality, but are not seeing this to be the “new normal” in a post-enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) Philippines. In making this conclusion, they conducted ground-, satellite- and modeling-based approaches to visualize the extent of air quality during pre-ECQ and while on lockdown.

“If we wish to maintain ‘good air quality’ to be the ‘new normal’, we have to make conscious choices in our usual activities pre-ECQ”, said Dr. Mylene Cayetano, an Associate Professor from the Institute of Environmental Science and Meteorology. [Read this story for more: Elevate air pollution problem in post-ECQ “new normal” agenda – UPD scientist] She emphasized that people surely noticed how clean air surroundings look and feel like after the lockdown, but this is far from what we can expect after the ECQ is lifted. “As we slowly enter the ‘new normal’ activities, the air pollution will go back to moderate to unhealthy levels”, Dr. Cayetano warned.

Weeks before the ECQ implementation in the northern and central NCR cities, elevated levels of NO2, a criteria pollutant that ‘primarily gets in the air from the burning of fuel, i.e., emissions from cars, trucks and buses, power plants, and off-road equipment, were observed (See Figure 1). On the first two weeks of ECQ up to the sixth week of quarantine, however, the weekly average levels of NO2 decreased, according to Roseanne V. Ramos, Assistant Professor from the Department of Geodetic Engineering, who mapped Metro Manila’s weekly NO2 average.

UP researchers develop VR prototype of stay-homecare for behavioral and psychological conditions – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/up-researchers-develop-vr-prototype-of-stay-homecare-for-behavioral-and-psychological-conditions/,"


Neurological conditions, such as Dementia and Cerebral Palsy, affect the cognitive abilities, motor functions, and performance of activities of daily living of patients. These manifestations may occur throughout the patients’ lifetime, which may render poor quality of life for both the patients and their families.

To date, there is no cure for both of these conditions, as pharmacologic management is limited to symptomatic treatment only. There are several therapies available for patients with these conditions, such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, and recreational therapy, which may improve outcomes and enhance the quality of life of patients and their families. In international settings, research studies are being conducted to explore the use of virtual reality technology as an innovative tool for the rehabilitation management of these conditions. Most relevant to the current Covid19 pandemic, the technology is seen to redefine homecare as stay-homecare. The VR media is meant to promote home therapy for the target patients, mostly composed of a population that is vulnerable to the current pandemic.

The research team – composed of Dr. Jaime DL. Caro (Department of Computer Science, UP Diliman), Dr. Veeda Michelle M. Anlacan, Dr. Michael L. Tee, Dr. Cherica A. Tee, Dr. Dominic Jamora, Dr. Marilie Ruiz Aguila (College of Medicine, UP Manila) and Prof. Gregg S. Lloren (College of Communication, Art, and Design, UP Cebu and the University of Edinburgh) – is developing an immersive technological system to rehabilitate the different neuropsychiatric symptoms that come with behavioral and psychological dementia.

The proposed Immersive Technology System (ImTS) will serve as a complementary strategy for implementing rehabilitation techniques for patients with dementia and behavioral and psychological symptoms and patients with cerebral palsy and mobility limitations. ImTS will manage the creation, customization, and fruition of multimedia interactive simulation of the world in a virtual environment (VE) that is meant to optimize the power of a technology that augments human capability. Such technology supplies a more flexible environment than the real world, thus giving users a new experience with minimized risk of real danger or physical harm."

"Gender inclusion, appreciative resilience vital to crisis response – University of the Philippines",https://up.edu.ph/gender-inclusion-appreciative-resilience-vital-to-crisis-response/,"

Response to a crisis, whether the crisis may be resolved quickly or drawn out over a long period, benefits greatly from gender inclusion and appreciative resilience. For which reason these actions are vital to successfully ensuring the psychosocial well-being of persons dealing with crises.

In “Capacitating Oneself for the New Normal”, Prof. Finaflor Taylan and Dr. Emely Dicolen discussed institutional and personal strategies in dealing with a crisis like COVID-19, from the prolonged quarantine period to the new normal. The online lecture was organized by the Social Work Program of the UP Open University (UPOU) Faculty of Management and Development Studies (FMDS) as part of the University’s Let’s Talk it Over series and was streamed on May 27 in UPOU Networks.

Taylan, a registered social worker who is a faculty member of the FMDS Social Work Program, talked about “Gender Perspective in Psychosocial Support and Well-Being”. She said the COVID-19 pandemic has magnified vulnerabilities and placed multiple burdens on women, especially the abused who may be “locked in” with their abusers. Unplanned and at-risk pregnancies may also occur. There have also been reports of power struggles in quarantine management, such as instances of “sex for quarantine pass”.

 

Screenshot of Prof. Finaflor Taylan delivering her presentation on “Capacitating Oneself for the New Normal”.

 

Taylan emphasized the fact that as individual, we should know the importance of our rights, recognize or condition and report violations of our human rights, be aware of existing and new rules and laws, and do volunteer work. She also mentioned “proactive protection programs” that may be undertaken by households and communities.

Using a code word to report abuse when one is afraid because the perpetrator is nearby, and having an exit plan to escape abuse are actions that may be taken, among others. In the delivery of gender-inclusive well-being programs, functioning structures for violence against women and children, gender and development, and reproductive health must not be derailed by the pandemic, because these programs address issues that did not go away when COVID-19 reached the country.

Taylan also mentioned the need to review referral pathways as the crisis has given way to new protocols. The remote delivery of psychological first aid (PFA), for example, is a critical form of service. It would help, she added, if previous reports of abuse were used to identify target areas for random, but regular, roving by security personnel for community safety.

 

Screenshot of Prof. Finaflor Taylan’s presentation slide on “COVID-19 and Gender Context.”

 

In giving psychosocial support to survivors of gender-related violence, PFA or the first interaction in a case is crucial. She underscored the necessity of using gender-fair, non-judgmental language. Building rapport by showing support, being empathetic, and empowering courage are keys to helping survivors sort through fears and anxieties. “They need support, not scrutiny,” Taylan said. She explained that help-seeking is a turning point for them and begins the healing process, so it is imperative that insensitive language is avoided because the survivors should not be “re-victimized”.

Taylan closed her talk by reiterating that gender rights are human rights, which means these rights ensure the well-being of all, regardless of gender.

Dicolen, the program chair of the UPOU Diploma in and Master of Social Work program, as well as being an associate professor at the UP Manila National Teacher Training Center for the Health Professions, discussed “Appreciative Resilience in Times of Crisis”, which was more of a personal technique to cope with problems."

As the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the planet, medical experts and scientists around the world have found themselves in an unprecedented race to find a treatment for the disease.

“At this time, there are no medical therapies that have been definitively shown to improve outcomes in patients with COVID-19,” said, Dr. Marissa Alejandria, director of the Institute of Clinical Epidemiology of the UP Manila National Institutes of Health, professor at the UP College of Medicine, and president of the Philippine Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

Speaking during the third installment of the UP webinar series, “Stop COVID Deaths: Clinical Management Updates” held on May 8, which focused on “The Treatment Landscape of COVID-19”, Dr. Alejandria reports that a number of drugs currently being studied around the world have demonstrated in vitro activity against the SARS-CoV-2 virus or have demonstrated potential clinical benefits in observational or small, non-randomized studies. She also presented clinical data on four antiviral drugs being used to treat COVID-19: chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir-ritonavir, remdesivir, and favipiravir.

“We have no drug that has been really approved, no effective antiviral therapy at this time,” she said. “The studies raised optimism, but we all know the limitations of observational studies and case series without a control group, so we don’t know if it’s the drug that resulted in a clinical benefit or if it is due to host factors or a combination of interventions. We still need clinical trials.”

Adequately powered randomized clinical trials are currently enrolling and are needed to establish the efficacy of these proposed therapies. One is the World Health Organization (WHO) SOLIDARITY Trial, which aims to test the safety and effectiveness of the four possible therapies in treating COVID-19 compared to standard of care. The Department of Health announced the participation of the Philippines in this last April 22, with Dr. Alejandria as country representative leader. Other randomized clinical trials around the world are the Anti-Coronavirus Therapies to Prevent Progression of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Trial or ACT COVID19; and the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial or ACTT."

Motivated by recent developments in the COVID-19 situation and incremental movements towards the new normal in Eastern Visayas, the University of the Philippines Visayas Tacloban College, through its Regional Environmental Information Systems program and Health Services Unit, has endeavored to visualize key COVID-19 data in the region.

This album is a collection of maps based on data from the Department of Health – Eastern Visayas Center for Health and Development. The presentation, which highlights spatial relationships between data, provides a different perspective on the public health crisis faced by the region. It also underscores the importance of protocols for mitigating the spread of the virus. It is hoped that these maps will serve as valuable input to the policymaking process of local government units and decision-making by individual members of society.

Disclaimer: The figures reported here do NOT represent final numbers and are subject to change after the inclusion of delayed reports and review of cases.

 

 

As of May 22, 2020, there were 26 confirmed COVID-19 cases reported. Tarangnan, Samar had the biggest number, followed by the municipality of Buruean with two confirmed COVID-19 cases. Three other cities and municipalities were also reported to have confirmed COVID-19 cases.

The COVID-19 pandemic, just like previous emergency and crisis situations, activated the UP Visayas Tacloban College (UPVTC) mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) core team. But unlike previous emergency and crisis situations, traditional face-to-face interaction was no longer possible. In a time of physical distancing and stay-at-home measures, MHPSS, as with many other forms of service, had to shift online.

In “Context, Opportunities, and Challenges for MHPSS in the time of COVID-19,” the inaugural episode of Pagsurumpay Online Talk Series streamed on May 23 in UPVTC’s Facebook page and launched in celebration of UPVTC’s 47th founding anniversary, three of the nine-member MHPSS core team discussed the group’s experience and reflected on ways it can improve and move forward in the new normal. It was moderated by fellow team member and UPVTC Psychology faculty member, Prof. Pierce Docena.

 

Prof. Ruth Edisel Rylle Sadian-Cercado (Screenshot taken of her in “Context, Opportunities, and Challenges for MHPSS in the time of COVID-19″)

 

Setting the context was Psychology Prof. Ruth Edisel Rylle Sadian-Cercado, who said that “MHPSS” is used in the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Guidelines in Emergency Settings and “refers to any type of local or outside support that aims to protect of promote psychosocial well-being and/or prevent or treat mental health conditions.”

She explained that MHPSS is nuanced and must be appropriate to the culture, language, health, and social system of the client. Within each population, Sadian-Cercado clarified, there are groups that are more vulnerable than others and their needs must be taken into account as well. These groups include children, elderly, persons with disabilities, marginalized persons such as members of the LGBT community, and in the current pandemic, people with suppressed or compromised immune systems.

Standards in response, the identification of individuals who may be trained to respond, the identification of issues that are inherent to the community, clarity of organization roles, referral pathways, and access to needed services must also be established.

Dr. Antonio B. Ramos, manager of the Lung Center of the Philippines (LCP) Department of Administrative Services and resource speaker for the sixth episode of the University of the Philippines’ “STOP COVID DEATHS: Clinical Management Updates” webinar series held on May 29, talked about the LCP experience in promoting hospital personnel safety during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The LCP serves as the country’s premier hospital for the treatment of lung diseases and as a referral center for COVID-19 moderate to severe respiratory diseases. Dr. Ramos said their personnel are now using about 500 personal protective equipment (PPEs) per day due to the increasing number of patients over the past weeks, and the hospital is still stockpiling PPEs for appropriate personnel safety and patient care.

According to Dr. Ramos, the LCP decided to make personnel safety its priority. He further talked about the hospital’s incident command system, safety officer and zoning, infrastructure modifications, equipment, supplies, and personnel care.

The structure of the incident command system includes the hospital’s officers for public information, safety, liaison, planning, operations, logistics, finance, and sub units, taskforces (medical, triage, personnel), and teams under these main sections. They hold daily briefings at the incident post situated outside of the hospital buildings. This post maintains an open-air ventilation setup to prevent virus transmission among personnel.

 

Hospital zoning and safety policies

Colored signs, pictures, maps, instructions, and reminders are posted in all corners and hallways of the LCP. Screenshot from the livestream of the sixth installment of the UP “STOP COVID DEATHS: Clinical Management Updates” webinar series.

 

Dr. Ramos said the hospital was divided and labelled into “safety zones”, with the red colored zones indicating “very high risk” areas, orange for “high risk”, yellow for “medium risk”, and blue for “lower risk”. He said that “for red zones, hospital personnel must wear full PPEs with boots. For orange zones, they have to change PPEs every time they have to enter a new room since there they are not yet sure if the patients are COVID positive or negative. For yellow zones, the laboratories and radiology areas, they wear their face mask unless there is need to wear full PPE if procedures are done. For blue zones, all other areas of the LCP, they are required to wear their face mask. There are no green zones or safe zones.”

“Upon entering the hospital grounds, everyone must wear a face mask and regularly perform hand hygiene,” Dr. Ramos said. “There are colored signs, pictures, maps, instructions, and reminders posted in all corners and hallways of the complex to increase LCP personnel’s awareness. Medical and non-medical personnel are also segregated, wherein passageways and elevators are also designated to prevent possible contact and virus transmission among personnel,” he explained.

 

Modifications and innovations

According to Dr. Ramos, the LCP infrastructure modifications include the putting up of: CCTV cameras, patients’ monitors, translucent and plastic doors, controlling ACH (air change per hour), temporary plastic walls, donning and doffing areas, and other modifications. He elaborated that these modifications allow the hospital personnel to see and monitor their patients better, control flow of air, and prevent virus transmission. “Another advantage of the LCP architecture is that it has interconnected halls and corridors that allow a one-way flow of personnel” wherein the entry for one area is at one end while the exit is on the opposite end, he added.

Dr. Ramos described their COVID-19 ward: “The air is controlled, the supplies, equipment and other needed items are segregated, including the tables, trashcans and disinfectants that are adequately replenished after every shift.” The nurses’ station is equipped with monitors for displaying patients’ vital stats side by side with CCTV display to allow them to see the patients’ conditions.  In the intensive care unit, the nurses can directly see the patients through a glass wall while computer monitors and CCTV also allow them to see the patients’ stats.

"Plans, Possibilities and Progress: UP academics moving into the “next normal” – University of the Philippines",https://up.edu.ph/plans-possibilities-and-progress-up-academics-moving-into-thenext-normal/,"


The University of the Philippines (UP) is coming to terms with the fact that we can no longer go back to the traditional modes of teaching and learning. However, this “next normal”is also opening up new prospects, platforms, and possibilities for teaching and learning, which UP is set to explore within the next two months.

A memorandum released by the UP System Office of the Vice-President for Academic Affairs (OVPAA Memorandum No. 2020-68) dated June 19, 2020 states that even before COVID-19, UP was already planning how UP students can continue learning despite class suspensions due to natural hazards, disasters, or social and political eventualities.

“Anticipating many more such suspensions in today’s volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world, the pre-COVID-19 UP System plan already entailed strategies to: 1) expedite the paradigm shift to lifelong learning; 2) accelerate changes in pedagogies and assessment that include the blending of face-to-face, virtual and experiential course work; and, 3) provide course packs at the start of every semester to facilitate independent learning as a value in itself, but most especially to make up for disruptions in the learning process, among others,” the memorandum stated.

Challenging but exciting

The COVID-19 pandemic that shut down the world merely catalyzed this overdue transformation of higher education in general and UP education in particular. The work during this unprecedented time is challenging but exciting, too, as opportunities open up for higher education institutions, including UP, to experiment with new and creative ways of delivering programs and courses, and to institutionalize innovations that enhance learning. Indeed, the “new reality” has revealed possibilities that were perhaps not as obvious before. Some examples the memorandum mentioned are the following:

• Inviting eminent visiting professors who in the past have hesitated to accept UP’s invitation because they could not afford to be physically away for an extended period of time;

• Inviting experts such as noted literary authors, artists, scientists, researchers, and practitioners to interact with students in virtual class sessions;

• Using uploaded plays, art works, music, TVUP (http://tvup.ph/) panel discussions, and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs);

• Offering modular courses in sequence within a semester when feasible;

• Incorporating available virtual reality applications in courses, while ensuring that students without online connections are able to access uploaded works and recorded sessions with experts asynchronously; and,

• Designing common courses collaboratively within a unit or across the UP System, among other possible changes.

For the next two months, UP faculty, administrators, students, and staffwill be working on “new ways of doing”, especially when it comes to: new modes of teaching and learning in the first semester of the new UP academic calendar, AY 2020-2021; preparing the physical and academic infrastructure for remote learning; preparing programs and courses for the possibility of blended learning; and, enhancing and modifying support for students’ academic instruction and well-being.

Modes of teaching and learning

The memorandum stresses that the safety of UP’s constituents is the University’s first priority when it comes to adopting remote learning and/or blending remote and face-to-face learning, if the public health situation allows it.

Because of this, all courses in the first semester will be delivered remotely. Any exemption must be approved by the chancellor of the constituent unit (CU), subject to strict compliance with the guidelines set by the Inter Agency Task Force (IATF) and local government units, and in consideration of the situation of students in the class which a unit endorses for exemption. Remote teaching and learning covers both asynchronous or non-real time communication (e.g., email, Facebook Messenger, Viber groups) and synchronous or real-time communication (e.g., lectures, webinars and teleconferences via Zoom or Google Meet) between teachers and learners. To avoid confusing students, the memorandum has instructed CUs to adopt one or at most two uniform Learning Management Systems (e.g., UP’s UVLE and VLE, Canvas, Google Classroom, Edmodo, etc.).

Academic calendar

The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted adjustments to the academic calendars of higher education institutions (HEIs) around the world. UP, for its part, is retaining the semester and midyear system with some adjustments, subject to the final approval of the Board of Regents (BOR).

One adjustment is the shortening of the first and second semesters to 14 weeks and the opening of the first semester on September 10, 2020, subject to student consultation. This shortening of the semesters was approved in principle by the BOR at its meeting on May 21, 2020."

UP CoPES helps build psychosocial resilience of self and others – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/up-copes-helps-build-psychosocial-resilience-of-self-and-others/,"

The UP CoPES was organized to better coordinate and harmonize the psychosocial aspect of UP Ugnayan ng Pahinungòd’s volunteer services. Image taken from UP CoPES official Facebook page.

 

Times of crisis can inflict not only physical and economic, but also psychosocial harm. These psychosocial hazards take a toll on both individuals and families, compromising the safety and productivity of those involved.

To respond to the need to provide members of the University and its partner communities with adequate psychosocial health during periods of crisis, the UP Ugnayan ng Pahinungòd recently launched the Committee on Psychosocial Emergency Services, or UP CoPES. The primary aim of the committee is to promote psychosocial well-being by providing volunteering opportunities to members of the UP community and its partners, especially during emergencies.

The approach the program and its constituent university counterparts take is “strengths-based” and “resilience-based” This approach taps into and recognizes the inner strength and ingenuity of individuals and communities. With respect to the University, the project works to equip students, faculty, staff members, and alumni of UP with the knowledge and skills to offer psychosocial support to themselves, their families, their peers, and communities.

A System of Support

UP CoPES is the system-wide umbrella committee for various psychosocial support programs being implemented by Pahinungod in UP’s constituent universities. It has three working areas: kamalayan (awareness promotion); ugnayan (setting up referral mechanisms, partnerships, support); and, kasanayan (training volunteers who can, in turn, also train others).

With the Ugnayan ng Pahinungòd celebrating its first year of reactivation under UP President Danilo Concepcion, as the official volunteer service program of the UP System, Pahinungòd Constituent Universities can now also collaborate through UP CoPES to coordinate and improve the psychosocial aspect of their volunteer and public service efforts. Through this body, UP’s CUs may combine their strengths to provide swift, robust solutions to emergencies, as well as to share best practices in training and public service.

Important precursors to UP CoPES were initiatives combining the expertise of different CUs to provide holistic public service in emergency situations.

In the wake of the 2019 Mindanao Earthquakes, the Ugnayan ng Pahinungòd joined hands with the UP Resilience Institute to form the UP Pahinungòd Mindanao Humanitarian Effort (MHE). UP Mindanao Pahinungòd Director Michael Gatela served as overall coordinator for volunteers; while UPD Department of Psychology Emeritus Professor Elizabeth Ventura headed the Psychosocial Team, Dr. April Mendoza of the UP Manila College of Medicine headed the Medical team, and Dr. Johnrev Guilaran of the UP Visayas College of Arts and Science acted as field focal person."

“We want our patients to be able to go back to the lives they had before being critically ill.” This is the end goal of physiatrists in providing rehabilitative care and treatment, as emphasized by Dr. Celso Bate of The Medical City and the Victor R. Potenciano Medical Center, in the eleventh episode of UP’s STOP COVID DEATHS webinar series on July 3.

And that journey back is a long one.

In “Rehabilitation for Critical Care Survivors of COVID-19”, Bate clarified that because the disease is new, rehabilitative care and treatment protocols have yet to be established; but most helpful are existing strategies used in patients with prolonged confinement in the intensive care unit (ICU) and/or who are afflicted with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Critical COVID-19 patients are sedated and immobilized for a long period of time. Their muscles weaken. Their joints get stiff and painful to move. They get pressure injuries. And they even develop the risk of getting deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. They have difficulty swallowing because of intubation. Bate said that in ARDS, patients are usually intubated for three to five days, “but COVID-19 patients are intubated and extubated multiple times and they are intubated for weeks!”"

Post-ECQ Job Risks: Analysis and Recommendations – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/post-ecq-job-risks-analysis-and-recommendations/,"


Problem Situation

On 12 May 2020, the IATF announced the relaxing of community quarantine protocols as we transition from Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) to Modified ECQ (MECQ), General Community Quarantine (GCQ), and Modified GCQ (MGCQ) starting on 16 May. Under the new schemes, the list of economic activities to be allowed are expanded at varying levels of capacity and subject to minimum health standards.

To inform the phasing-in of different sectors and jobs, we present here findings from our risk assessment of various job types.[1] Our analysis showed that:

• As economic activities are opened up, proper phasing in of different sectors and jobs should consider both economic contributions and the health risks involved, with health as the top priority. Understanding disease-related risks associated with different jobs and sectors can help guide management of the COVID-19 pandemic.

• About half of Philippine jobs are categorized as high contributors to the economy for the next 18 months but are high-risk spreaders.

• Half of the jobs are exposed to moderate risk to disease, while 38% are at high risk.

• Manageable interventions like increasing PPE and hygiene practices and/or effectivity, and switching to work from home arrangements can lessen jobs at moderate to high risk by at least 21%.

We also propose simple decision support tools that can be used as guides for the reopening of workplaces.

 

Potential COVID-19 Spreaders by Job Type

The previous ECQ practically suspended on-site work for all job types, except for our so-called healthcare- and non-healthcare frontliners. This has serious economic implications especially since 816 out of 987 job types (82%) in the Philippines have high importance to sustain the economy in the next 18 months (Figure 1)[2]. Our main challenge then is that the majority of these jobs (65%) have high potential to spread the COVID-19 disease as they require close or regular interaction with people. This includes health workers (Category E) who make up 13.8% of jobs.

Aside from those in the healthcare industry, most of the jobs that are both highly important and high-risk spreaders at the same time (Category D) are in the food, agriculture, manufacturing, and service sectors. These sectors are highly interdependent with others, and effects on one sector can have long-lasting effects on another. Outside of healthcare workers, we need to carefully reconsider the costs and benefits of reactivating activities related to this group, and ensure that strict public health measures are followed.

We also need to look into the case of jobs that are relatively not as critical in sustaining the economy for the next 18 months but are high risk disease spreaders. These comprise 16.4% of jobs (Category C), mostly in the education and recreation sectors. These jobs are relatively less interdependent on others. For this sector, a clear intervention would be to explore other modes of job delivery to minimize social interaction, without necessarily completely discontinuing operations, such as through continued work from home and other alternative working arrangements. This way, the potential for spreading the disease through these jobs becomes low.

About one-fifth of jobs (17.7%) are of great importance to sustaining the economy for the next 18 months and are low risk disease spreaders (Category B). Most of these are in the financial, banking and BPO companies. These also are highly interdependent and have long-lasting effects on other sectors. Only less than one percent (0.9%) of jobs are considered part of Category A which contribute less to sustaining the economy for the next 18 months and are low risk disease spreaders. Minimum public health measures should be observed in these two groups (Categories A and B).

 

 

COVID-19 Risk to Various Workers

To understand the potential impact of reopening certain economic activities, we analyzed the potential risk of becoming sick and spreading the disease through various jobs in particular sectors and occupations. The risk scores were calculated using their potential exposure to the disease and physical proximity to others. The level of exposure to disease of the different job sectors were based on the number of people they encounter and how long they work, while physical proximity is estimated based on how crowded their workplace is. The risk score also takes into account workers’ protection level, such as use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and hygiene practices.[3]

Assuming a 30% level of workplace protection, our analysis revealed that half of the jobs are exposed to moderate risk to disease, while 38% are at high risk. Aside from health and social workers, high risk industries include workers involved in water supply, sewerage, waste management and remediation activities; education; accommodation and food service activities; transportation and storage; arts, entertainment and recreation; and other service activities.

Not surprisingly, by occupational group, high risk was found among service and sales workers, professionals, but mostly due to health care professionals, and technicians and associate professionals. Breaking these down into sub-major groups, the ones most at risk include the armed forces, personal care workers, and protective services workers.

 

Job Risk by Income Level

Our analysis further showed that there is no correlation between average monthly salary and risk level. Majority of the jobs have average monthly incomes of around 20,000 to 60,000 pesos, with varying risk scores ranging from low (0.08) to high (4.55). A few high-salary jobs (more than 80,000 pesos) were estimated to have low or moderate risk scores. These include high-ranking army officers, judges, chief executives, and managers (Figure 2).

In any case, while the level of risk is not particularly related to the level of job salary, COVID-19 may have disproportionate impacts as those in the lower income bracket would have a much harder time to cover hospitalization expenses or recover lost income due to suspension of work. We also note that the data we have for the analysis do not account for jobs in the informal sector.

 

Job Risk by Regions

The impact of the pandemic varies across regions, with  the National Capital Region, CALABARZON and Central Visayas the hardest hit in terms of incidence and prevalence of the disease. Cognizant of this, the IATF released risk-based guidelines in deciding whether regions, provinces or highly urbanized cities should be under ECQ, MECQ, GCQ or MGCQ.[4]

To shed light on which sectors can be activated while minimizing risk at the same time, we conducted Binary Integer Goal Programming at the regional level. Our model showed that for regions to produce at least 60% of the Gross Regional Domestic Product, 22.7 million workers can go to work with the average computed risk score of 0.58 +/- 0.77. These workers belong to several sectors, namely, agriculture, hunting and forestry; fishing and aquaculture; manufacturing; electricity, gas, steam, and air conditioning supply; water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities; wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles; transportation and storage; information and communication; financial and insurance activities; real estate activities; public administration and defense; compulsory social security; and human health and social work activities. Additionally, for this to happen, the Education and Other Services sectors may not need to resume activity under GCQ in all regions.

 

Effect of Interventions on Job Risks

Protection level plays a key role in the risk level. Decreasing the protection level increases the risk of each job for each industrial sector, occupational group, and UPSE classification. Without any protection, almost two-thirds (63%) of UPSE Category D jobs and one-third (33%) of UPSE Category B jobs will be at high risk of getting infected. Under increased protection level (45%), which assumes perfect use of face masks and strict hand hygiene, 74 out of 505 (15%) UPSE Category D and 11 out of 175 (6%) UPSE Category B jobs are at high risk.

Job risks due to disease spread can be managed through various measures like the use of PPEs, hygienic practices and work from home arrangements to lessen contact. Job risks are lowered when protection levels were increased by 1) general increase in protection levels by 15% assuming increased or more effective use of PPEs; 2) 99% protection level for jobs that can shift to work from home; and, 3) 80% protection levels for certain health workers again assuming increased or more effective use of PPEs. Moderate and high-risk jobs lessened by 8% and 14%, respectively. Low risk jobs increased by 21%. There is ample room for intervention from the work from home setup since currently, around 90% or 887 jobs are normally not work from home, and most of these are moderate and high infection risk jobs.

#KaagapayUP project to bring hope to financially challenged UP students – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/kaagapayup-project-to-bring-hope-to-financially-challenged-up-students/,"


 

The word kaagapay is typically associated with being at one’s side. Its constituents, the affix, ka-, which indicates relation, and its root, agapay, or support, together connote mutual assistance, trust, care, and respect from individuals who desire that others become fully functional persons.

With these qualities in mind, the University of the Philippines (UP) launched the Kaagapay sa Pagaaral ng mga Iskolar ng Bayan or #KaagapayUP project on July 21, 2020. The project’s primary aim is to help UP’s financially challenged students acquire the resources to engage in the remote and blended learning solutions instituted by the University in response to COVID-19. The launch was broadcast live over Zoom, and through the TVUP Youtube channel.

For many students of UP, finding a source and sense of support in these difficult times is a necessity. The pandemic has transformed the landscape of education in the country and the world. UP itself, via a Memorandum from the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs dated June 4, 2020, has adopted remote teaching and learning for academic year (AY) 2020-2021, with the possibility of blended remote and face-to-face learning in courses with discipline-specific skills (i.e. laboratory, studio, practicum, etc.), provided public health requirements are met.

Unfortunately, not all of UP’s students can effortlessly adapt to these changes. In her message, UP Vice President Elena E. Pernia estimated that of its roughly 60,000 students, there are around 1,600 financially challenged students who do not have the resources to acquire computers and stable internet access. Furthermore, there are some 4,000 students from households categorized “vulnerable”, whose incomes cannot fully support these needs because of the pandemic.

The #KaagapayUP program aims to raise funds to provide financially challenged students with their own laptop computers and internet connections that can help them access UP’s remote learning courses starting in AY 2020-2021. These courses will utilize asynchronous communication platforms, such as online message boards and instant messaging applications, as well as synchronous or ‘real-time’ platforms, such as UP’s Learning Management Systems, Zoom, Google Classroom, Edmodo, and others.

As its name suggests, the Kaagapay sa Pag-aaral program encourages the global UP community to support its most financially challenged students. The project aims to create a culture of philanthropy on all levels, from the alumni to the student body, and to promote the practice of giving back and paying it forward.

More importantly, the project was created to inspire confidence among UP’s own students with the thought of having someone on their side in times of need. This is poignantly symbolized by the project’s icon, two sunflowers growing side-by-side, representing not only mutual support, but hope.

 

Screenshot of Vice President for Academic Affairs Cynthia Rose Bautista’s message during the official launch of the Kaagapay sa Pag-aaral ng mga Iskolar ng Bayan fundraising campaign via Zoom. The replay may be viewed on TVUP’s YouTube channel.

 

UP Vice President for Academic Affairs Cynthia Rose Bautista noted that the COVID-19 pandemic expedited UP’s remote and blended learning solutions, which were being developed the past few years to deal with disruptions from calamities or sociopolitical unrest. The #KaagapayUP project, therefore, would aid in the training of all of UP’s students by seeking to level the remote learning playing field for those who might otherwise struggle to adapt to an educational landscape that has changed overnight.

Bautista noted that while “intelligence may be normally distributed, opportunities in this country are not,” which leads to many talented but financially disadvantaged students being admitted into UP. “We cannot allow the highly unequal structure of Philippine society to further disadvantage these students in the time of COVID,” she insisted, an inequality that is even more sharply manifested in the different capabilities of students in access to basic learning materials and devices.

UP is, therefore, tapping into the generosity of its community and the public to help the nation’s future leaders through the #KaagapayUP project to “transcend the socioeconomic divide that constrains the fulfillment of their potential and allow them to thrive, engage, learn, and create even in times of adversity.”

“The year 2020 is the year that will forever be remembered as the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is a daunting challenge to say the least. This is where the UP education comes into play.”

So spoke UP Regent and UP Los Baños (UPLB) alumnus Francis C. Laurel, entrepreneur and member of the third generation of the esteemed Laurel clan, in his address to the UP Los Baños Class of 2020 who marched, figuratively, in UPLB’s first-ever virtual commencement exercises. The 48th UPLB Commencement Exercises was held online on August 15, livestreamed via the UPLB YouTube channel.

Regent Laurel went on to give the graduates five pointers on how they can succeed out in the real world. The first is to stay positive all the time, to remain optimistic and focused, to capture the moment, and to be committed. The second is to think out of the box. “This pandemic has brought a myriad of opportunities never thought of before. As UP graduates, you are best prepared to undertake this challenge,” said Regent Laurel, stressing that for UP graduates to succeed, they will need the “extra edge” of innovation and creativity.

The third is to always uphold integrity and honesty, to not lose sight of the forest for the trees, and “in whatever you do, to plan well and execute well”. Regent Laurel’s fourth tip is to work extremely hard, as the only way the new graduates can repay the sacrifices their parents made to help them finish a UP education is to have a successful career. Finally, “embrace the challenges and crises of your life”, tempering optimism with courage at all times.

“Graduating from the UPLB is a milestone,” Regent Laurel finished. “Be proud of it. And as you move on, always remember your roots. Bear in mind you are a part of the great tradition called the Los Baños spirit. It is as old as UP. It is a spirit truly unique to our beloved UPLB.”

A recent study by the Interdisciplinary Applied Modeling (IAM) laboratory of the University of the Philippines (UP) Mindanao recommends that “the local government should consider extending the community quarantine” beyond the April 19 end date of the community quarantine in Davao City. The IAM lab is part of the UP COVID-19 Pandemic Response Team – Bioinformatics and Modeling Group, which is mainly composed of mathematicians across the different UP campuses.

The team headed by Dr. May Anne Mata, an associate professor in applied mathematics specializing in mathematical biology, simulated a model to predict the effect of lifting the community quarantine on April 19 and July 1 based on parameter estimates obtained by fitting an epidemiological model to the cumulative confirmed cases in the Davao Regionfrom March 15 to April 4.

The model has five population categories, namely, Susceptible (at risk to contract the disease), Exposed (infected but not infectious), Asymptomatic Infectious (without symptoms but infectious), Confirmed Cases (assumed isolated and will not infect the susceptible), and Unreported Infectious (includes only those with symptoms).

“When CQ [community quarantine] is lifted on April 19, the infected population will continue to persist . . . For instance, we see that the exposed population is stable from May to July after it peaks during the last week of March,” the study finds. “However, if we maintain CQ at the status quo’s rates of transmission and confirmation, we observe a decreasing trend in the number of exposed individuals around mid-May.”

Dr. Mata, however, cautions that the model estimates are dependent on various assumptions and only show a possible, more likely scenario. Hence, predicting the appropriate lifting dateis difficult and can only be accurately obtained by increasing the number of observations and updating parameter estimates.

“Lifting the quarantine prematurely is very risky. To be safe, perhaps we can extend the community quarantine for 14 days. If we get 0 new cases and 0 new PUIs [persons under investigation] within that period, then we can lift the community quarantine,” Dr. Mata suggests.

The next phase of the study will fit the model on data within the duration of the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) from April 4 to 19, covered by EO no. 23A series 2020, to see if the strategy is effective.

Extending the community quarantine, however, has an economic tradeoff, one that is difficult to model at this time. “We just don’t have data on logistics like total budget of Davao City government for COVID-19 response, breakdown per barangay, cost of goods distribution, budget per household, just to name a few, to do a model on this. Also, this will require a different modeling strategy.”

Using the same data, another study by the team shows the importance of testing persons under monitoring (PUMs) and persons under investigation (PUIs). “We recommend that the government should consider testing more PUMs and/or PUIs in the region for early detection of infected population so that these individuals will be isolated immediately from the susceptible pool,” the study states. This point is particularly important for asymptomatic individuals who may show no signs of disease but may freely and unknowingly spread the disease to the population.

In another study, researcher Zython Paul Lachica and other members of the IAM lab team collated available information from COVID-19 positive cases from the Department of Health within a 40-day observation period to assess the risk factors that increase a patient’s hazard rate.

The study yielded the following preliminary findings: “Male COVID-19 positive patients are estimated to face a hazard rate of 12.79 times the hazard faced by female patients. Coughing patients face a hazard that is 28.35 times the hazard of those who have no cough. Furthermore, a patient with pre-existing condition”—such as hypertension, kidney problem, and/or diabetes—“may have a hazard rate of 2,838 times the hazard rate of patient without any preexisting conditions. On the other hand, patients who are 55 to 64 years old and 65 to 74 years old face hazard rates that are less than patients who are 75 years and older.”It should be noted that these results are based on preliminary data, and the hazard estimates will be fine-tuned once more data becomes available.

Based on these findings, the study recommends prioritizing for testing patients who are 75 years and older and those with preexisting medical conditions once they experience coughing, persons under monitoring who might be asymptomatic patients, as well as those with high exposure to the COVID-19 positive patients such as health workers.

Briefer on How an Epidemic Happens and What is an Epidemic Wave

Mary Grace Dacuma, Ph.D.*
University of the Philippines, Los Baños

 

 

The COVID-19 epidemic in the Philippines has most likely started with an imported case from an infected person or persons who entered the Philippines. This infected person or persons with the virus is/are the index case(s) that spread the virus to others locally. The index case(s), especially those that did not cause local transmission, does not form part of the epidemic wave.

When the virus is transmitted locally to other people, there is an incubation period. For COVID-19, the incubation period (meaning the virus infecting the new host but without any symptoms/clinical signs yet) can be on average 5.2 days up to 14 days. That is why you see a flat line after the introduction of the index case (see Figure).

 

 

After the incubation period, newly infected hosts develop symptoms and clinical signs – that is why they seek medical attention. In addition, because of the threat of the pandemic, our country increased its vigilance and capacity to screen more people. Hence, you can see the rapid spread and increase of cases (see Figure). The ease of movement of people by plane, land transportation, or boat made it very easy to spread the virus across the Philippines. Hence, we have an epidemic (meaning it has spread all over to many provinces and infecting thousands of people).

We will know that we have reached the peak of the curve when the net increase in the number of active cases is starting to decline (because of lockdowns, country-wide vigilance, etc.). Eventually, there will be reduction in number of cases (where the number of infected people recovering will be higher than those becoming infected). Then there will be a point where there are no more cases. That’s when we know the epidemic has stopped.

That curve from the rapid rise of local cases to reaching the peak to reduction in number of cases to the extinction of an epidemic is one epidemic wave. I did not include the index cases that started the epidemic in the “wave”. They acquired infection elsewhere out of the country.

 

 

 

Note: The term epidemic instead of Pandemic was used because the COVID-19 infection is spreading locally. It is a pandemic because it is now in 213 countries and territories infecting millions of people. This is just a simplified curve or wave for an epidemic. It can be more complex when we plot actual data.

Social Interactions and Post-ECQ School Opening and Mobility of Older People: Analysis and Recommendations – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/social-interactions-and-post-ecq-school-opening-and-mobility-of-older-people-analysis-and-recommendations/,"


POLICY NOTE NO. 5 / 05 May 2020

 

Problem Situation

The novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) feeds on social interaction. It spreads from one person to another through droplets that may remain contagious for hours or days, depending on the setting of transmission. This is why the government’s core response to the evolving pandemic is anchored on social distancing and community quarantine. The idea is simple enough: limit people’s social and physical interactions to slow down, if not eliminate, COVID-19 spread, and at the same time, protect vulnerable groups.

Following the government decision to extend the ECQ in selected areas and identify GCQ areas with attendant regulations, how can we ease up restrictions on people’s mobility while minimizing risk? Particularly, how do we respond to the needs of two sectors on both ends of the population spectrum, namely, children and older people? It must be noted that the State is obligated to provide continued learning for the former, and ensure fundamental rights and freedoms of the latter at all times.

To shed light on the matter, the UP COVID-19 Pandemic Response Team looked into the country-wide total age-group interactions per day and its implications on school opening and the mobility of older people. The results from our models complement existing knowledge on the probability of outbreak for cities and municipalities of the country (read Policy Note No. 2) and the situation in nearby cities and municipalities (i.e. transport links; border control policies) to help the IATF and LGUs make science-based decisions. Overall, when combined with knowledge on identified areas with a chance of outbreak, testing and isolation capacity, provincial health care capacity, quarantine policy, and capability to detect without delay COVID-19 symptomatics and asymptomatics, the analysis and recommendations we made here can be used for government strategy as we transition from ECQ to GCQ.

 

Age-Group Interactions

The Philippines has a generally young population. In light of this, we simulated how children and teenagers interact with older adults who are 65 years old and above, cognizant of the reality that older Filipinos usually live with their children and grandchildren under one roof. Our models show that 56% of interaction with all age groups are amongst the 0-20 years of age, compared to only 1% among those aged 65  and over. Moreover,  49% of the interaction of seniors 65 years and above happens with the age group of 0-20 (Figure 1). This essentially means two things: 1) social interaction is highest among the young;  and 2) the same group accounts for the greatest amount of interaction with older people.

Relaxing restrictions on physical interactions of children does not bode well if matched with empirical data from DOH. As of 1 May 2020, more than 97% of those who tested positive for COVID-19 among those aged 5-20 years old are asymptomatic, have mild symptoms or have recovered indicating that this age group may be more resilient to COVID-19 compared to older groups (Figure 2). The number of deaths from COVID-19 generally increases with age, rising noticeably starting at age 50-54 and steadily increasing rather steeply thereafter. In all, 70% of the total deaths are from cases age 60 and over. Putting together what we know about interactions by age group, the relative resilience of the young and the likelihood of severe disease among the old, the conclusion is that the young aged 0-20 who have the most interactions with all age groups, and especially with the old, have a high likelihood of bringing home the infection from school and from their other social contacts, being mostly asymptomatic or only showing mild symptoms, to the more vulnerable members of their households.

Implications on School Opening

To estimate the effects of school opening, we tested different scenarios for the National Capital Region (NCR).  Assuming 90% of businesses open on 15 May, higher education institutions (HEIs) physically open on 15 August, and elementary and secondary schools physically open on 1 September, all in 2020, the following were modeled: 1) All schools physically open; 2) 50% HEIs, elementary and high schools physically open; 3) all schools physically open and there is increased detection of COVID-19 cases with about 30,000 tests per day; 4) 50% HEIs physically open but all elementary and high schools closed; and 5) all schools at all levels physically closed (Figure 3).

 

Figure 3. Mean result of simulations for different scenarios of physical school opening in NCR using default protection level of 10%; 10k tests per day and effective surveillance to find 30-50% of the infected individuals; prevalence in the environment and nearby communities of 1/10,000; and assumption that individuals with mild and asymptotic condition are 20-50% less infectious than symptomatic cases (https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/04/09/science.abb6936).

 

The models reveal that with the current testing detection rate and the scenario with 10,000 tests per day, physically opening all schools in NCR may increase the transmission of COVID-19 to R values greater than 1 (gray, blue and yellow curves, respectively). On the other hand, continued physical closure of all schools up to the end of the year, considering the model assumptions, may continue to lower the R value to near, but not necessarily equal to zero values by the end of 2020 (orange curve). The two other scenarios show varying rates of decline in R value, but all close to or below 1.  As we have explained in Policy Note No. 2, the ultimate goal of the government is to bring the reproduction number Rt value to less than 1 or closest to 0 until a vaccine is discovered.

 

Implications on Mobility of Older People

The transmission potential of senior citizens, defined as age 60 and above, was analyzed and compared with people of age below 60 using the time-varying reproduction number or Rt. With respect to the transmission potential, older adults were relatively less transmissive of the disease within their group than the younger individuals. However, senior citizens had been highly transmissive before the March 15 enhanced community quarantine with Rt greater than 1. During the quarantine period, older persons were less transmissive to other `younger counterparts (Figure 4)."

POLICY NOTE NO. 6 / 08 May 2020

 

Introduction

Our previous policy notes already highlighted some epidemiological metrics vital for monitoring the state of the country in its fight against COVID-19. These metrics provide context, give insight, and serve as a guide to help stakeholders take control of the disease and monitor our own progress. As we have repeatedly pointed out since Day 1, any analysis is only as good as the data that we have.

Relevant, and accurate data about COVID-19 and the resources the country has in the fight is important. The speed and timeliness of how such is released is equally critical. We do recognize the difficulties in the collection of detailed and timely records of COVID-19 data on a nationwide scale. However, no matter how difficult, these problems need to be addressed at the soonest possible time and should be of top priority. Here, we discuss prevailing data issues we have observed, and our recommendation for open data moving forward.

 

Data Sharing Practices

Collecting COVID-19 data has not been easy. Since the country finally accepted the presence of community transmission around the first week of March 2020, government’s data reporting protocols have changed far too often (Table 1). There was initially no standard time of the day for when DOH posted the official daily numbers. There was even a brief period when DOH stopped releasing updates, leaving people using the data in the dark.

 

 

Fortunately, the DOH has been open to feedback, and this has been reflected in the improvement in reporting.  There is now a centralized resource for modelers to use as a common reference. There is also regularity and predictability on when reports are given, and this is commendable given that transparency and timeliness are key to managing any crisis situation, especially a pandemic.

However, there is still room for improving the quality of the data, and the process of collecting information for DOH’s data drop in the tracker. It is important to make sure that correct data is captured as swiftly as possible to minimize uploading of erroneous and anomalous, if not missing, data.

 

Data Accuracy and Integrity

The availability of accurate and relevant data is a basic requirement in managing any situation that requires urgent and targeted response. Almost three months since we had our first confirmed case in the person of a Chinese national on 30 January, we have yet to reconcile differences in numbers between DOH and LGU sources. For example, on 03 May 2020, DOH reported 7 deaths (28 recoveries) in Laguna, which was 22 deaths (65 recoveries) lesser than the provincial government’s official count.

Accuracy, however, goes beyond correctness in reporting aggregate numbers. Recent data drops by DOH revealed a number of alarming patient-level inconsistencies, if not gross errors. A quick comparison of the April 24 and April 25 data drops showed that forty-five (45) cases have changed sex from male to female or vice-versa; while 75 others had the data on age modified. This is on top of the 516 cases where the residence data was reclassified to another city, if not a completely imaginary city (i.e. a barangay or district) like what happened in the City of Manila (Table 2).

 

 

Related to the problem of accurate residential reporting is the handling of certain variables in the DOH data drop. For example, RegionRes is a variable for the region of residence and is coded in text such as “NCR”, “Region III: Central Luzon”, and so on. RegionPSGC is the region code based on the Philippine Standard Geographic Code [PSGC], compiled by the Philippine Statistics Authority, based on their mandate to prescribe “uniform standards and classification systems in the generation of government statistics to ensure harmonization and comparability of statistics in the country and at the international level” (PSA 2020). The DOH data drop introduced this variable last April 26, 2020 for regional, provincial, and city/municipal classification. Each region has a unique code in the PSGC; however, as seen in the table below, inconsistencies in the coding of the PSGC for cases within regions have been problematic. It is noted that the DOH Tracker uses the RegionRes variable for statistics, not the Region PSGC (Table 3).

 

* Total does not necessarily agree with the 10,004 cases reported in May 6, 2020 as regions with full-matching PSGC codes have been disregarded.

 

There are other troubling anomalies in recent data drops of DOH. For example, 18 cases no longer have data on residence in the April 25 update. On the same date, the recovery dates of two cases were either missing or changed. One patient who reportedly died on April 24 is no longer dead the following day.

The DOH data drop is also inconsistent with its use of date formats, which makes it difficult for automated systems of extracting and updating data from case information. It has made the work of data analysis difficult because of these sudden changes (Table 4).

 

 

These lapses may seem small relative to the total size of data contained in the daily updates, but they have significant implications on the reliability of our scientific analyses on COVID-19. Patient case data is the keystone for effective and insightful metrics and analysis. The integrity of the data drops is particularly important given that no less than President Rodrigo Roa Duterte himself has said many times that the government’s decision on managing COVID-19 will be based on science. We fully support President Duterte on this call for science-based decisions, hence this statement."

On February 13, 2020, President Rodrigo R. Duterte addressed the nation on television as fears over the spread of the Novel Coronavirus 2019 or Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) gripped many. Speaking in a video message recorded at the Malacañang Palace, he assured the public that his administration was taking all the necessary measures to limit the spread of the disease. “I call on our people to remain calm, vigilant, responsible. And I also ask [for] your trust and cooperation, support as we face the challenge,” he said.

Earlier during the day, the Manila HealthTek Inc. posted on its official Facebook page a photo of the COVID-19 test kit developed by experts from the Philippine Genome Center and the National Institutes of Health of the University of the Philippines Manila.

The GenAmplify Corona Virus Disease-2019 rRT PCR Detection Kit was the product of several days and hours of intensive research and testing by experts from the University who built upon the genome sequence of COVID-19, made available by the World Health Organization on its website.

According to PGC Executive Director Cynthia Palmes-Saloma, the kit was made possible after genetic experts from others countries used Next Generation DNA Sequencing in trying to understand the nature of the COVID-19 virus. Among the facilities of the center is its DNA Sequencing Laboratory which was established in 2013.

DNA or deoxyribonucleic acid is the building block of every living being.  These molecules contain the genetic makeup of an organism, it is composed of nucleotides guanine, cytosine, thymine and adenine (G-C-T-A). Sequencing is the process of determining the order of the nucleotides in a DNA.

For the molecular biologist, Dr. Saloma, Next Generation Sequencing is essential in understanding the nature of living things, including viruses and bacteria. And it can even be used to determine the identity and properties of unknown organisms. “If there’s an emergency and there’s a totally unknown organism, and some might say that it’s a virus, it’s bacteria, or it’s an unknown, then Next Generation Sequencing will come in handy,” she said. The same process, she quickly added, was used in understanding the Novel Coronavirus from Wuhan, China.

Next Generation Sequencing, also known as Massive Parallel Sequencing, is a process by which several DNA samples can be simultaneously sequenced using computers, which produces more results when compared to the Sanger Sequencing, which can only process one DNA fragment at a time.

For Dr. Benedict Maralit, since DNA is found in all living organisms, it can be used in determining the nature of a bacteria or a virus. DNA sequencing is, he said, “a manner of characterizing DNA.” Through this method of analysis, he and his team can determine if a DNA is unique or comparable to those of other organisms. As head of the PGC’s DNA Sequencing Core Facility, he leads the center’s unit, which takes the first crack at the specimens which are sent to their institution for analysis."

Since Day One, the UP COVID-19 Pandemic Response Team has done simulations on the spread of SARS-COV-2 in the country. Our bioinformatics group—composed mostly of mathematicians from different UP campuses—estimate a peak by end of April to June with approximately 140,000 to 550,000 people infected in Metro Manila. A significant proportion of this estimate will not be detected unless they are tested. Hence, these estimates can guide testing capacity requirements for the succeeding months. Hospital bed capacity requirements among other healthcare metrics, can also be reasonably projected based on the proportion of severe cases (5%).

155-200 is the number to call. And it’s open 24/7.

The UP-Philippine General Hospital (UP-PGH) launched its Bayanihan Na! COVID-19 Operations Center on March 30 to answer queries related to COVID-19, including how to volunteer and donate. [Watch the livestream of the launch]

This, just 13 days after it was initially discussed by UP President Danilo Concepcion, UP Manila (UPM) Chancellor Carmencita Padilla, and UP-PGH Director Gerardo Legaspi; and only a week after UP’s acceptance of UP-PGH’s designation and responsibility as a COVID-19 referral center.

These initiatives are on top of another COVID-19 effort: the field validation by the UPM National Institutes of Health of GenAmplify, the University-developed testing kit.

In partnership with PLDT, which provided 20 lines for the hotline, and the PGH Medical Foundation Inc. (PGHMFI), which will facilitate donations, the University is housing the Ops Center at the Nurses Home within the UPM compound, separate from the UP-PGH. It is currently being manned by 60-70 student volunteers in three shifts, although around 20 to 30 more are needed.

The UP COVID-19 Pandemic Response Team (UP PRT) launches new features in endcov.ph, a web portal created to provide the public with vital information and tools in the fight against COVID-19.

Since it’s launch in April, the UP PRT has contributed new resources to the dashboard including features that show Case Projections, the State of Transmissions in NCR based on LGU data, Municipal/City Density Map based on current active cases, and a Policy Sourcebook on COVID-19.

 

COVID-19 Case Projections

 

Through the Case Projections feature, anyone can view projections of the “Cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the Philippines”, by date up to the end of August. These projections are under the assumption of medium risk. Users can easily set the date through the calendar provided or through advanced options such as “this year” and “this quarter”. The feature uses models developed by the UP Los Baños group of the UP PRT, led by Dr. Jomar Fajardo Rabajante, who shares their notes within the feature.

The enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) imposed over Luzon, along with other interventions, has indeed slowed down the spread of COVID-19 virus, based on “the best available data”, according to a team specially formed by the University of the Philippines to help government make informed interventions against the pandemic.

Summarizing a five-page policy note by the UP COVID-19 Pandemic Response Team, the UP Resilience Institute (UPRI) said: “What took three days for the total number of cases to double now takes six days.” [Read the policy note here.]

It added that, compared to Singapore and South Korea, COVID-19 related deaths in the country has not increased significantly. This means that the ECQ has been “relatively successful” given the estimated case fatality rate of 5.38 percent and a reproduction number of 0.6398, which is lower than 1.

“After April 30, the best thing to do is to implement a graduated activation of ECQ. Provinces and lower-level LGUs should decide whether to extend, lift, or relax community quarantine based on how far they are to an estimated outbreak threshold,” according to the summary.

The team’s policy note added that model estimates would improve much if nationwide barangay-level data on COVID-19 were made available daily, preferably through an automated LGU data collecting system.

The team volunteered to help LGUs track and monitor their data through its endcov.ph dashboard.

Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) Advice for the UP Community

as of 14 February 2020

 

On December 31, 2019, an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus or novel coronavirus disease, previously called 2019-nCoV, was first reported from Wuhan, China, and has since spread across the globe. Coronaviruses belong to a large family of viruses found in both animals and humans. Some of these viruses cause illnesses that include both the common cold and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

With over 20,000 cases reported across 24 countries, including the Philippines, it is important to know what we must do to prevent an infection. For us in the UP community, the University has a set of protocols if we or someone we know contract what the World Health Organization has named the COVID-19 acute respiratory disease.

 

Positive for exposure

If you have traveled to China, Macau, Hong Kong or other areas with confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, or if you have had close contact (within one meter) with a confirmed case of COVID-19 infection, you should stay at home and monitor yourself for symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath, for 14 days from the date of arrival or exposure. While current data show that people who have symptoms contribute most to the spread of the disease, it may also be possible that people infected with COVID-19 may be infectious before they even show any symptoms.

If you have come into close contact with a confirmed case, or you have been exposed to potential infection during your travels, please seek consultation with the University Health Service on campus, or at the nearest health facility, and undergo a health assessment before resuming your daily routine.

At this point, you will be considered a Person Under Monitoring (PUM), and you will be advised to go on self-quarantine for 14 days. Here are some home quarantine instructions for PUMs:

Stay at home except when getting medical care.
Separate yourself from the other people in your home.
Avoid sharing household items.
Wash your hands frequently with soap and water and sanitize with alcohol.
Cover your cough and sneezes with tissue.
Wear a face mask with the colored side facing outward.
Monitor your symptoms.
Call ahead before visiting your doctor.

 

Positive for symptoms

If you have been exposed to COVID-19 through your travels or through close contact with a confirmed case, and you are showing respiratory symptoms, here is what you should do:

Seek consultation with your University Health Service on campus or go to the nearest health facility. Once there, you will be asked to fill out a form that will include questions about your travel history and/or if you have come into contact with a confirmed case. Make sure you wear your face mask properly and call ahead.
You will be brought to a holding area where the physician on duty will more closely investigate the timing of your symptoms. At this point, you will be designated as Patient Under Investigation (PUI).
The physician will inform the City Epidemiology Surveillance Unit (CESU) or the Municipal Epidemiology Surveillance Unit (MESU), and will continue to coordinate with the CESU/MESU in monitoring your condition, which will include admitting you to specialized hospitals with the capacity to treat the disease.

 

Preventive measures

When it comes to good health, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. For the members of the UP community who have not recently traveled to China, Macau, Hong Kong or come into close contact with a confirmed case, follow these infectious respiratory disease-prevention rules from the Department of Health and World Health Organization:

OBSERVE PROPER HAND HYGIENE. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds (or two rounds of “Happy Birthday”), and, if available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
REMEMBER THAT YOUR FACE IS SACRED. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Your hands may have touched contaminated surfaces, and you can transfer germs from the surface to yourself.
RESPECT PERSONAL SPACE. Avoid crowded places and maintain at least a one-meter or three-foot distance between yourself and other people, particularly those who are coughing, sneezing and have a fever.
PRACTICE GOOD COUGH ETIQUETTE. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze and properly and immediately dispose of the tissue. Wash your hands properly afterward. (Refer to Item No. 1.) You may be asked to wear a face mask to protect others.
WEAR THE FACE MASK PROPERLY. Wear the face mask with the colored side facing outward, fully covering the nose, mouth, and chin. Never touch the mask with your hands. Remove the mask by holding only the strings. Properly dispose of the mask. Wear a face mask only when necessary, such as if you are immunocompromised or have a cough and cold.
AVOID EATING RAW OR IMPROPERLY COOKED ANIMAL PRODUCTS, as COVID-19 is also animal-transmitted.
WASH YOUR HANDS WITH SOAP AND WATER AFTER CONTACT WITH PETS. Although there is no evidence yet that pets can be infected with COVID-19, this will help prevent the spread of other germs such as E. coli and Salmonella. Also, wash your hands with soap and water after visiting an animal market or wet market, and avoid unprotected contact with wild or farm animals.
WASH YOUR HANDS AFTER HANDLING THINGS SUCH AS DOOR KNOBS AND TABLE TOPS. Although coronaviruses do not survive long on objects such as letters and packages, they have been detected on places like door knobs, table tops or other surfaces.
KEEP YOUR GADGETS AND PERSONAL ITEMS CLEAN. Disinfect your mobile phones, tablets, laptops, bags, eyeglasses, etc. regularly.
GET YOUR INFORMATION ONLY FROM THE PROPER AUTHORITIES to prevent the spread of fake news and disinformation. Proper health authorities include your University Health Service on campus, the Department of Health and its city and regional offices, and the WHO.
BOOST YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM by eating a balanced diet, getting enough sleep and exercise, and drinking plenty of water. A strong immune system will be better able to fight off COVID-19, as well as other diseases.

 

Know who to ask

To prevent the spread of misinformation and undue alarm, it is important that we get our information only from the proper authorities.

For questions and concerns, please contact the Public Health Unit of the University Health Service on campus or in the health facility near you.

Modified Community Quarantine beyond April 30: Analysis and Recommendations – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/modified-community-quarantine-beyond-april-30-analysis-and-recommendations/,"


Problem Situation

The extension of the Luzon-wide Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) raises the question on how effective the ECQ has been to contain the spread of COVID-19. If it is, how should it be implemented after April 30 without unnecessarily paralyzing local economies over a long period of time?

It is important to tackle this question at this time because LGUs rely upon national directives for policy and decision-making. Crafting of guidelines for an extended ECQ requires foresight, one that is informed by scientific data on estimates of the effectiveness of pandemic control strategies. It requires key metrics that are primarily epidemiological in nature and must be infused with as many scientific points of view as possible. Here, we show the effect of differences in population density of communities in the analysis of the transmission of COVID-19 to help national and local officials make informed decisions whether to extend, lift, or relax community quarantine.

Is the Luzon-wide ECQ effective?

Time-series analysis shows it now takes a little longer for the number of confirmed cases to double in number. What took 3 days for the total number of cases to double now takes about 6 days to happen (Figure 1). Based on these trends, one can estimate about 9,000 to 44,000* possible cases reported by the end of April 2020. In general, this indicates the relative success of the ECQ–along with other interventions–in containing the spread of the virus. However, we must not simply rely on the number of cases as a means to project courses of actions.

 

 

Figure 1. Simple time-series analysis showing typical trends in the DOH reported positive cases (latest data: 10 April 2020). The current trend shows that the number of reported cases doubles about T2 = 6 days, while there has been a linear trend for the past 10 days (since 01 April). The color bar represents the data range used to estimate the linear projection. Note: Represents confirmed cases and does not include undetected, asymptomatic and mild cases.

 

Another metric that can be used to test effectiveness of the ECQ is the case fatality rate. Based on best available data as of 10 April 2020, we report an estimated case fatality rate of 5.38% and a reproduction number of 0.6398, which means that the ECQ has been effective (Figure 2). The goal is to keep bringing the reproductive number down to lower than 1 through continued medical and non-medical interventions.

Quantifying the effectiveness of the ECQ, however, is highly dependent on efforts in discovering new cases. Specifically, there are situations in which countries were able to bring their reproduction numbers down close to 1, but later testing pulled the number up, such as the case of Singapore. In the case of Korea, consistent increased testing coupled with contact tracing facilitated the detection and management of the epidemic, lowering the reproduction number of COVID-19.

Estimating Local Healthcare Capacity to Deal with COVID-19 Case Surge: Analysis and Recommendations – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/estimating-local-healthcare-capacity-to-deal-with-covid-19-case-surge-analysis-and-recommendations/,"


The Challenge: Estimated Severe and Critical Cases at Peak

The rising number of cases of COVID-19 infections on a daily basis is a serious concern as there are limits to hospital care capacity for patients with serious symptoms (e.g. difficulty in breathing). Should the number of infected people rapidly rise, there may come a time when the hospital care resources will be overwhelmed. The UP COVID-19 Pandemic Response Team, in its latest model run, estimates the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases to reach 9,000 to 44,000 by the end of April 2020. As of April 16 DOH reports a total of 5,660 confirmed cases.

Majority (around 81%) of Filipinos who contract COVID-19 will exhibit uncomplicated or mild illness. These patients do not require hospitalization, but isolation is necessary in order to prevent viral transmission. Approximately 14% will develop severe illness requiring oxygen therapy, while the remaining 5% will require intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. Estimates on the number of Filipino COVID-19 patients who will require hospitalization is shown in Table 1.

In a scenario at the peak of the COVID-19 crisis, where a COVID-positive person can infect two others (R0=2), our simulations show that about 51,933 Filipinos will need hospitalization, approximately 13,194 of whom will need ICU treatment. Outside of Metro Manila, the biggest bulk of severe and critical patients would come from Regions III (Central Luzon), IV-A (CALABARZON), VI (Western Visayas), and VII (Central Visayas).

 

 

Can Local Healthcare Systems Absorb the Surge?

There are 456 hospitals in the country classified either as Level 2 or 3. Altogether, excluding those classified as specialty hospitals, these hospitals combined will have a total bed capacity of 67,119. Approximately 41% of these beds are in government-owned hospitals while the remaining 59% are in private hospitals. Figure 1 shows the proportion of hospital beds according to ownership.

In this analysis, it is assumed that 80% of these beds would be used for treating people with other illnesses. In 2012, the average bed occupancy rate among Level 3 hospitals in Metro Manila was 77.2%. DOH-retained hospitals across the nation had an average bed occupancy rate of 105% in 2013. For the treatment of critical cases, there are a total of 2,335 critical care beds in 450 intensive care units in the Philippines. This corresponds to 3.1% of the total approved bed capacity of Level 2 and 3 hospitals in the country.

 

 

We estimate, based on our projections (Figure 2) and assuming a scenario with a reproductive rate (R0) of 2, that three provinces adjacent to NCR, namely, Bulacan, Cavite, and Rizal, may face a serious shortage of hospital beds for handling severe and critical cases. COVID-19-related patients alone would fill up the total bed capacities in these areas. We also identify 25 provinces and two cities in Metro Manila, namely, Malabon and Navotas, which do not have Level 2 or 3 hospitals within their geographic bounds. Thus, it is imperative to capacitate Level 1 hospitals in these areas to address the situation.

On the projected availability of ICU beds corresponding to critical COVID cases at the provincial and regional levels (Figure3), we estimate that it is beyond the capacity of most provinces to handle the surge of the COVID-19 crisis in the Philippines at its peak. There is a lack of available critical care beds because across the country, there are only a little over 2,000 ICU beds to cater to the projected 8,800 to 19,800 critical COVID-19 cases.

Dear members of the UP community:

 

I would like to express my sincere gratitude and appreciation to you all for your amazing response to this crisis—a global situation the likes of which we have not seen in our lifetimes. We have been forced to suspend classes, work and all other campus activities, and to stay inside our homes and practice social distancing, all to contain the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) and to keep our healthcare system from being dangerously overwhelmed. For some of us, the effects of these measures on our finances, work, and social lives, and on our mental and physical health, have been devastating.

 

Yet, I have seen UP rise magnificently to the challenge. Every constituent unit, every sector, and every member of the UP community has demonstrated and continues to demonstrate incredible courage, resourcefulness, intelligence, selflessness, and compassion. Our scientists have used their knowledge to help their fellow Filipinos. Our medical and health practitioners, including our interns, are serving heroically at the frontlines of this war. Our faculty are exploring new ways and alternative platforms to fulfill their mission to teach, no matter the circumstances.

 

Our skeleton staff are working to keep our University running and to protect our communities. Our administrative officials have been tirelessly steering the University through rough waters. And our students, alumni and campus residents are doing their part by using their training to build sanitation tents for public use, or by donating food and supplies to fellow members of the UP community in need, or by campaigning for support for our doctors, nurses and health centers, or by simply doing what they can to educate, to ease people’s burdens, and uplift their spirits.

Message from UP President Danilo L. Concepcion to the PGH community

26 March 2020

 

To the Staff and Administration of UP-PGH,

 

On behalf of our community at the University of the Philippines—indeed, on behalf of the Filipino people—let me thank you, first of all, for your courageous, selfless, and outstanding service in these very trying times. Our nation and our people are suffering from a devastating scourge, and those of you at the frontlines are performing a heroic and unenviable function.

You have been through this before. During the Second World War, your wards overflowed with the victims of that conflict. You treated Filipinos, Japanese soldiers, and American internees alike, doing your utmost with pitifully depleted supplies. Rather than be drafted as foot soldiers, your interns were pressed into the medical service ahead of their time.

But even, and especially, in more ordinary times, you have attended to our people’s needs, especially our poorest. “PGH” has become synonymous with hope and caring, with compassion and commitment, even in the direst circumstances. You never give up, you always give your all, often beyond the call of duty, and certainly beyond your pay grade.

Today, we all face the gravest threat of this generation to our nation’s well-being, and once again we have been called upon to close ranks and face the enemy—an infectious and insidious pathogen—with you, our Infectious Disease Specialists and Medicine personnel, at the spearhead of our defense.

It is with deep humility that those of us who march with you and behind you acknowledge that we may not be able to do as much, but we will also do our best to support you, so no effort and no sacrifice will go to waste.

In accepting the formidable responsibility passed on to UP-PGH to serve as a Covid-19 Referral Center, let me assure you that we will also protect and take care of our own ranks through specific measures, such as:

– Securing enough PPEs and instituting proper Infectious Control Measures in the hospital,

– Ensuring a strict one-week tour of duty followed by a two-week period of quarantine,

– Arranging for free lodging and accommodation as well as transportation requirements for all our HCWs in PGH during this crisis,"

Section 1. Policy Statement
Computers and networks are powerful technologies for accessing and distributing information and knowledge. They are strategic technologies for the current and future needs of the UP SYSTEM.
For now, computing facilities and network infrastructure are a costly resource and thus must be used solely for teaching, learning, research, and other officially-sanctioned activities. Also, since these technologies allow individuals to access and copy information from remote sources, users must respect the rights of others, particularly to their privacy and intellectual property. There is therefore a need for rules and regulations to ensure equitable, secure and reliable access to these resources. The following regulations will govern the use of computing facilities, networks and other Information Technology (IT) resources of the University of the Philippines System.
These regulations aim to:
ensure an information infrastructure that promotes the basic missions of the UP SYSTEM in teaching, learning and research;
protect the integrity, reliability, availability, confidentiality and efficiency of the IT resources of the UP SYSTEM;
establish processes for addressing policy violations and providing sanctions for violators;
emphasize that the UP SYSTEM shall not be liable for any damages incurred from the use of IT resources and for any claims and suits arising from the unauthorized and irresponsible use of the same;
warn users that use of IT resources for partisan political activities as defined in relevant rules and regulations of the Civil Service Commission or the University of the Philippines, or for any unauthorized commercial purposes is prohibited; and
notify users of the existence of this Policy.
Section 2. Basic Standards
The same standards and principles of intellectual and academic freedom developed for university libraries shall be applied to material received from the network. The same standards of intellectual and academic freedom developed for faculty and student publication in traditional media shall be applied to publication in computer media.
As constituents of the academic community, faculty, students, and academic and non-academic staff should be free, individually and collectively, to express their views on issues of institutional policy and on matters of general interest to the academic body. The constituents of the academic community should have clearly defined means to participate in the formulation and application of institutional policy affecting academic and student affairs. The actions of the constituents of the academic community within the areas of its jurisdictions should be reviewed only through orderly prescribed procedures.
Section 3. Definitions
Agreement Form means document in which the user undertakes to comply with this Policy. The form may be electronic.
Confidential information means data or information which on its face is not intended for unrestricted dissemination. Examples include student records, examination archives, proprietary technical information, disciplinary case records, administrative records, and the like.
Document when used in this Policy shall refer both to the paper and its electronic format.
Information Technology System or IT System includes computers, terminals, printers, networks, modem banks, online and offline storage media and related equipment, and software, databases and other data files that are owned, managed, or maintained by any unit of the University of the Philippines.
For purposes of this Policy, any other equipment, computer unit or external network, when attached to, or used to access and/or interact with any component of, the IT System may also be considered part of the IT System.
Private files means information that a user would reasonably regard as private. Examples include the contents of electronic mail boxes, private file storage areas of individual users, and information stored in other areas that are not public, even if no measure has been taken to protect such information.
System and Network Administrator means a person designated to manage the particular system assigned to her/him, to oversee the day-to-day operation of the system, or to preliminarily determine who is permitted access to particular facilities and resources of the IT System, whether hired on a temporary, contractual or permanent basis.
UP SYSTEM means the University of the Philippines System and all its constituent units.
User means any person, whether authorized or not, who makes any use of the IT System or any of its components by any means or from any location.
Section 4. Scope And Applicability
a. General Coverage.
This Policy applies to all facilities within the IT System and all its users.
All users should be aware of these regulations, and should realize that when using the computers within the UP SYSTEM, they are bound by these regulations. Users may be required to sign a form agreeing to comply with this Policy. However, failure to sign the agreement form will not release users from coverage of this Policy.
b. Local and External Conditions of Use.
Individual units within the UP SYSTEM may define additional “conditions of use” for components of the ITSystem under their control.
These conditions must be consistent with this overall policy but may provide additional detail, guidelines, restrictions, and/or enforcement mechanisms. These units will be responsible for publishing the regulations they establish and their policies concerning the authorized and appropriate use of the equipment for which they are responsible. Copies of these policies should be given to the President, Vice-President for Development, the Intellectual Property Office and the Office of Legal Services.
Where use of external networks is involved, policies governing such use will be applicable and must be adhered to.
Section 5. General Responsibilities
a. General Responsibilities of Users.

In general, users of the IT System must:

refrain from seeking to gain unauthorized access or exceed authorized access;
respect software copyright and licenses and other intellectual property rights;
respect the rights of other computer users; and
be aware that although computing and information technology providers throughout the university are charged with preserving the integrity and security of resources, security sometimes can be breached through actions beyond their control. Users are therefore urged to take appropriate precautions such as safeguarding their account and password, taking full advantage of file security mechanisms, backing up critical data and promptly reporting any misuse or violations of the policy.

Every member of the University community has an obligation to report suspected violations of the Acceptable Use Policy for Information Technology of the U.P. System or any of its units. Reports should be directed to the system and network administrators, Chairs, Deans, Chancellors or the President.

Exploring Korean Studies in Europe – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/exploring-korean-studies-in-europe/,"

Dr. Kyung Min Bae at the Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany. Contributed photo.

The last time I visited Europe, in 2019, was on a personal trip with my family. But this year, returning to Europe for the first time after the pandemic, I felt like a first-time traveller. Given that I am not the type who enjoys unlimited inflight film watching, crossing different time zones, and waking up multiple times only to realize that the plane is still hours away from its destination, I had to prepare my body and mind for the long flight from the Philippines to Germany.

However, even with all the hassles of international travel, I believed it would be a great opportunity for UP Korea Research Center (UP KRC) to promote ourselves, as well as to learn from those in other Korean Studies institutions in Europe with whom we rarely get the opportunity to interact. I was scheduled to present, this November, a paper titled “Return Migration to Where I was Not Born: Two Korean-Filipino Youth’s Experience” at the 6th Social Sciences Korean Studies European Network (SoKEN) conference.

The event was held at Goethe University Frankfurt in Frankfurt am Main, which has a thriving Korean Studies program headed by Dr. Yonson Ahn. Although I was given the choice to join online, and admittedly seriously considered that option, I believed it was time for real human connections again. It was only right to go in person.

Apart from the conference, I was lucky enough to visit two other institutions: the Freie Universität Berlin and the University of Copenhagen. Dr. Eun-jung Lee, Director of the Institute of Korean Studies, Freie Universität Berlin, generously invited me to be part of the 6th Berlin Forum on Korea organized by the Graduate School of East Asian Studies (GEAS). I served as a discussant to share some insights on the importance of right approaches to Korean studies by both Korea-based and overseas institutions.

In UP KRC, our main goal is to train home-grown Filipino scholars who will study Korea in their respective disciplines and through their own lens, rather than imposing a unidirectional way of understanding Korea. I noted the importance of contextualizing what Korean Studies could mean in different countries and institutions, as each has a distinctive socio-historical background that should be considered. At the University of Copenhagen, through Dr. Barbara Wall, I observed Korean Studies classes under the Department of Cross-Cultural and Regional Studies, and also gave an overview on UP KRC’s activities and Korean studies in the Philippines.

“Far tho’ we wander o’er island yonder,
Loyal thy sons we’ll ever be”

So go the lines from the UP Beloved, the official school hymn of the University of the Philippines. Or as UP alumni who were students in the 1970s onwards and know the hymn as the UP Naming Mahal sing it:

“Malayong lupain amin mang marating,
Di rin magbabago ang damdamin”

In October this year, Atty. Angelo A. Jimenez, the 22nd President of the University of the Philippines, was invited by several UP alumni associations based in the United States to participate in their festivities and to come and meet the Iskolar ng Bayan who did, indeed, wander far yet remained true to their alma mater.

On October 14, Jimenez headed to the San Francisco Bay Area to meet with the UP Alumni Association of San Francisco, Inc. (UPAASF), which was celebrating its Golden Jubilee with the theme, “50 Years of Service, Building a Legacy”. During the UPAASF’s Gala Celebration, UP President Jimenez delivered the keynote address after presenting the UPAASF Distinguished Alumnus Award to Mrs. Cynthia Bonta.

Following a lunch reception and fellowship with Alphans and Deltans on October 15, President Jimenez participated in the quarterly Board of Trustees meeting of the Friends of UP Foundation in America, Inc. (FUPFA) on October 16 in New York City, where he presented his vision and priority projects for FUPFA’s support. Later, in the evening of October 18, Jimenez also joined in the celebration of the FUPFA’s 40th anniversary during the Donors Appreciation Night, where he was guest of honor and keynote speaker.

Finally, from October 19 to October 22, President Jimenez traveled to New Jersey to participate in the 22nd Grand Reunion and Convention of the UP Alumni Association in America, Inc. (UPAAA)—a three-day celebration that featured former Philippine Vice President Ma. Leonor “Leni” Robredo and National Scientist and then UP Manila Chancellor Carmencita Padilla, among others, as the other guests of honor.

Below are photos and videos from UP President Jimenez’s trip to meet and greet the UP alumni who embodied the lines from the UP Naming Mahal, and to share his administration’s vision and strategic initiatives with the members of the UP community who keep the UP spirit alive across the USA.

The education of an Iska – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/the-education-of-an-iska/,"

Edeline Payawal shares the stoke from sea to school.

 

When the air conditioning unit inside her hotel room in Leyte woke her up with its loud noise, Edeline Payawal could not have known how her life was going to change. Payawal is an Iska whose achievements have only become more meaningful since that fateful day on November 8, 2013.

As the UP College of Mass Communication alumna tells it, “At the hallway, a guest told me to transfer to the hotel’s main building while the water was ankle-deep. I went back in to our room to check on my friends; however by the time we had to leave the building, the water was already neck-deep. Then suddenly, the roof broke down so that the rain started to pour on our floor. And we only had our room’s window to access the hotel’s main building by crossing over a water tank right beside it. We were 40 people in the building who had to climb out the window and cross over the water tank while braving the gusting winds of Typhoon Yolanda.”

“I can vividly remember the sound of everyone in despair. At that moment, I resigned myself to the fact that I was going to die that day. I prepared myself for that moment. But all of us were able to get to the main building,” she continues.

Standing right outside the hotel’s main building after the storm, she saw a pushcart loaded with two pale, lifeless teenagers retrieved by rescuers. “From the horror of possibly dying to seeing actual death, I was seriously in a state of shock. At some point I thought I had an out-of-body experience, thinking that it could have been us,” she confesses.

For several months after the storm surge, the cum laude graduate kept questioning herself why she had been spared, while too many victims did not deserve to die. “I always asked, what meaningful thing did I do? Is it really all about finishing college with honors, having my own research firm, and being successful? Those who lost their lives in Typhoon Yolanda had families on their own, who were pillars of their communities, as compared to me. Nobody would be concerned more than my parents.”

 

From sea to school

The Yolanda experience led her to establish Surf to School. Surf buddies and Iskas Edeline Payawal and Nika King began this program in 2013. “That year was a time of giving. So, I asked friends who were willing to join in this donation drive. The immense support from friends and other networks inspired me to organize the program, and make it sustainable rather than remain a one-time charity project,” Payawal explains.

“The Surf to School Program is a collective effort of wave lovers to help these children sustain their interest to stay in school. It aspires to persuade them to live a balanced life both in school and in the sea,” she continues.

Catching up with Surf to School’s Siargao leg this year, the program brought volunteer facilitators for various arts workshops and sports clinics, and donations of school bags and supplies to the island. Since its establishment, the program has already reached the shores of Baler, Pundakit, La Union, Puraran, Bagasbas in Quezon, Pagudpud and Sorsogon. Residual funds were used to set up surf competitions with scholarships as grand prizes, according to Payawal.

Plant science for the people – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/plant-science-for-the-people/,"


He dreamed of becoming a doctor and now he is addressed as Dr. Pablito Magdalita. Instead of a medical degree, however, he has a PhD in Plant Breeding and Plant Biotechnology from the University of Queensland, Australia. “I went from wanting to help human health to plant health. It’s ultimately about wanting to help improve lives through science. I loved all my science classes in high school,” Magdalita says.

Going into medicine was something his family couldn’t afford. His father was a coconut farmer and his mother was a storekeeper. Practicality and a scholarship from the Philippine Coconut Producers Federation, Inc. prompted him to take up agriculture at Luzonian University (now Manuel S. Enverga University Foundation) in Lucena City, Quezon in 1978.

If it weren’t for that decision, Magdalita wouldn’t have started the journey to becoming the scientist he is today—one known for his work on numerous hibiscus hybrids, several varieties of fruits, and on plant breeding, genetics, and diseases. He holds a patent for the ACC oxidase gene and its use and is currently awaiting the grant of another patent from the Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines for the coat protein of the papaya ringspot virus (PRSV). With principal breeder Dr. Violeta Villegas, he co-developed the papaya hybrid Sinta, which is tolerant to PRSV. The other fruit varieties he co-developed include the Aguinaldo guyabano, Amarillo rambutan, Mabini jackfruit, Mapino chico, Red Princess cashew, Roja rambutan.

“At first it was curiosity, then it was excitement about the possibilities of how I could make crops better. I was inspired by the challenges posed by my professors in plant breeding to create improved crops through breeding and selection,” he explains about his agriculture courses. Just like that, the dream of becoming a medical doctor was soon forgotten.

Married to his career

“The environment in UP is competitive, so I am inspired to be productive,” Magdalita says, describing his 35-year stint in the University.

He started as a research aide in 1982 at the Institute of Plant Breeding (IPB) and enrolled in UP Los Baños’ Master of Science program in 1983, majoring in Plant Pathology and Plant Breeding. Moving up the ranks to become a research assistant, research associate, and eventually a university researcher, Magdalita spent most of his UP life conducting various studies and experiments on the development of ornamental and fruit crops.

After his doctoral and post-doctoral studies on plant breeding, plant biotechnology and genetic engineering from the University of Queensland in the late 1990s, he was asked to teach molecular biology and biotechnology courses at the Institute of Biological Sciences, but not as a full-time faculty member. It wasn’t until 2010 that he officially joined the ranks of UP faculty at the College of Agriculture and Food Science."

If there is anything that Dr. Eva Cutiongco-de la Paz seems not to enjoy, it’s getting undue credit. The winner of the 2018 Dangal ng Bayan Award was admittedly nervous when her mother, a former faculty member at the UP College of Education, suggested having their photo taken with the tarpaulin celebrating her feat.

“I was hoping nobody was there,” she said, “and that nobody would recognize me when we were having our family picture taken at the Oblation Plaza.”

As far as her research is concerned, Cutiongco-de la Paz is quick to laud the contributions of her collaborators over her own. The clinical geneticist and current executive director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has certainly published on a broad range of subjects, from the genes implicated in rare diseases to our population’s genetic diversity. When asked, she tends to downplay her role in each of them. “None of these is just about me,” she says.

There is, however, one topic that she talks about with pride. And that is her passion as a clinician-scientist.  Having fuelled a career that earned her an award for “sustained contributions in the field of genetics,” this passion involves using her knowledge of genes to provide accurate diagnoses of illnesses to families and managing their multidisciplinary care. This passion, which describes the field of clinical genetics in a nutshell, has shaped her character as a scholar, a teacher, and, most importantly, a healer.

Getting to this point was a journey that took Cutiongco-de la Paz nearly around the world. After surviving disasters abroad and receiving genetics training from some of the world’s top institutions, the pediatrician by training hopes that what she learned can now be used to help Filipinos and their families live healthier, more dignified lives.

Deviation from form

Graduating from the UP College of Medicine in 1989 was something Cutiongco-de la Paz thought would necessarily lead to a conventional career as a physician. An invitation to avail of a research fellowship at Kobe University’s Graduate School of Medicine in 1995, however, would change these plans forever.

While there, she had the opportunity to study a condition called Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) in great depth.  The disease is associated with a mutation in a gene on the X-chromosome and is mostly found in males. This mutation causes abnormalities in a protein called dystrophin in our muscles that makes them fragile and easily damaged. Afflicted children typically fall over and become wheelchair-bound. Since the heart and diaphragm consist themselves of muscle, those who fail to manage the illness typically die before age 30.

 

Dr. Cutiongco-de la Paz is conferred the Dangal ng Bayan Award by President Rodrigo Roa Duterte.

 

Although her stint in Kobe University introduced her to how deeply human genetics can influence a patient’s well-being, it was cut short unexpectedly by the Great Hanshin Earthquake—Japan’s second strongest in the 20th century. This coming before the age of social media, her survival was confirmed only after a nail-biting wait. “My mother couldn’t eat for a few days, because she didn’t know if I was alive or dead,” she recalled.

She decided instead on coming home, to develop her knowledge elsewhere. Cutiongco-de la Paz was accepted soon after for a fellowship in clinical genetics at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada. She said her initial plan was to study the genetics of infectious diseases, which seemed logical given the country’s needs. But it was in this hospital that she got fully exposed to the grim consequences of what she called dysmorphology—the study of congenital anomalies, more commonly known as birth defects.

“‘Morph’ means form,” she explained, “and ‘dys’ means a deviation from usual form.” Dysmorphic children, therefore, tend to possess genetic abnormalities that give them altered appearances when compared even to family members. “I got exposed to the clinics and I saw how the families needed help. With an appropriate diagnosis, you could actually provide them with the proper management.”

Homecoming

Upon finishing her fellowship, Cutiongco-de la Paz came home and joined UP Manila Chancellor Carmencita Padilla, a geneticist herself, who actually served as her inspiration to get into the field of Genetics, in setting up comprehensive genetic services needed by the country. Together, they established a Clinical Genetics Fellowship Training Program at the PGH. This is the first and only one of its kind, teaching and training program in the subspecialty of Genetics in the country. The program is designed to provide the knowledge, understanding and skills required for the competent evaluation, management, genetic education and counseling of patients with genetic disorders and their families.

“And what we did, because Dr. Padilla was trained in Australia and I trained in Canada, was to put our training programs together to get the best of both”. They began opening the program to physicians willing to be trained in different clinical genetics sub-areas, from the laboratory to the counseling room. To date, they have graduated twelve clinical geneticists, with four more in training."

To the UP community, the name Jose “Pepe” Alcantara is up there in the annals of the brave as one of the UP student-activists who opposed martial law. Now, coming back to UP, not as a student leader but as Executive Vice President (EVP) in President Angelo Jimenez’ administrative team, Jose Fernando Tagum Alcantara still carries the fire of activism, purified by struggle and experience, and channeled into a different form.

Answering the call

The call to activism came early, although it took the form of another kind of calling, the priesthood. This led the young probinsyano from Batac, Ilocos Norte to enter Christ the King Seminary of the Divine Word Missionaries (SVD) in his first year of high school.

Life in the seminary was all about routine. “You wake up at 5:00 in the morning, shower at 6:00, then go to Mass. At 7:00, you prepare for school. Seminary life gave us some kind of discipline and structure.” Alcantara added with a laugh: “Pagpasok mo sa UP, grabe, total change.”

He entered UP in 1976, a year he described as a time when UP students, faculty and those in non-academic sectors reawakened after the numbing shock immediately following the declaration of martial law. “The year 1976 was the beginning of questioning: ‘Bakit pinataw ang martial law? Makatarungan ba yan?’ The community started holding symposia and outdoor activities, even though these were not allowed by the government and the military.”

He immediately took to UP’s liberal spirit, and by his second year, became president of UP Namnama, a student organization for Ilocano students. He was also part of the founding group of the Sandigan para sa Mag-aaral at Sambayanan (SAMASA). “In the seminary, we were exposed to social realities, so that when they talked about political issues, madali kong na-absorb. Naging automatic na nagustuhan kong makiniig, magsalita, until I became part of student activism in UP.”

“I was told that I was the very first student to be arrested inside a classroom in Palma Hall. I was detained and imprisoned for two long years because of activism.” – Alcantara

 

Two years of darkness

His activism soon drew the attention of enforcers of the regime, and in 1979, he was arrested while inside the campus by a military intelligence group. “I was told that I was the very first student to be arrested inside a classroom in Palma Hall,” Alcantara recounted. “I was detained and imprisoned for two long years because of activism.”

He was brought to Camp Crame, where he spent six months in a small room, roughly six by eight feet. The walls were painted black and the room had no windows, no light, and the constant darkness made it impossible to ascertain whether it was night or day. Afterward, he was transferred to the Bicutan detention center.

Return to student activism

After his release in 1981, Alcantara wanted to recoup his strength and focus on his studies, but fate had other ideas. “I was asked to run for the Student Council. It was a difficult decision, but it was in the blood, so umoo naman ako.” He urged a younger student, a “very talkative straight-shooter” named Lean Alejandro, to take on the chairmanship; but when Alejandro refused out of respect for seniority, Alcantara became the second chairperson of the Student Council, serving from 1982-1983 after Malou Mangahas.

It took Alcantara five years to finish the four-year Bachelor of Arts in Political Science program. He marched in the commencement exercises in 1983, and received the UP Diamond Jubilee Scholarship Award. He had been Chairman of the UP Student Council, founding Chairman of the Center for Nationalist Studies and KASAMA sa UP, and founding National Chairman of the League of Filipino Students.

That same year, Alcantara left for the USA. He earned his masteral degree in International Economics from the University of South Carolina in Columbia in 1987, then his Doctoral Residency in International Economics at the London School of Economics in 1991.

Life in the corporate world

“In London, I was asked to help a team working on the integration of the Philippine Stock Exchange,” he related. The Manila Stock Exchange and the Makati Stock Exchange were merged and became the Philippine Stock Exchange in 1997; and Alcantara, who was Vice President for International Trade for the Philippine International Trading Corporation from 1995 to 1997, became Senior Vice President of the Philippine Stock Exchange from 1997 to 2001.

His experience in the private sector spans 32 years. He worked in various top positions in an array of industries, and served as executive adviser and consultant for economic, business and infrastructure projects in both the private and the public sector.

Returning to UP

Then in 2023, another call to serve came when new UP President Jimenez asked Alcantara to join his team. “I have to admit, it was a difficult decision. I’m technically a retired professional.” Still, not one to shy away from the call no matter how it came, Pepe Alcantara chose to serve.

“There is excitement or the feeling of challenge,” he said about returning to UP. “And I love the work. This is the time to help the President, the UP System, to take a transformative direction.”"

“Digital transformation is really about changing the way we educate our students.” – Lallana

 

Not everyone can make the jump from teaching political science to advocating the use of information technology for better governance and education. But Dr. Emmanuel C. Lallana has certainly proven that he can.

“I am a political scientist who knows technology,” he describes himself.

From being a student leader in the waning days of the Marcos dictatorship to becoming one of the country’s leading advocates in digital transformation, the former UP associate professor of Political Science has certainly gone a long way from what was then the College of Arts and Sciences in UP Diliman to becoming a member of UP President Angelo Jimenez’s executive team.

As the new university administration’s Adviser on Digital Transformation, Dr. Lallana is given the challenging task of providing the backbone for the realization of Jimenez’s dream of a digital national university. He admits that it is a vision he and the new president have long been discussing even back then when Jimenez was a still a member of UP’s Board of Regents.

“Digital transformation is really about changing the way we educate our students,” Lallana said.

As a UP student during the height of the Martial Law years, Lallana recalls how different and difficult it was back then to communicate with fellow students and the rest of the University community. He shared how they had use typewriters to prepare materials on the burning issues of the day, and how the same documents were mass-produced using mimeographing machines, producing copies which were then disseminated to the University community. Nowadays, with smart phones, students can easily communicate and disseminate information and organize events.

After finishing his studies in Political Science in Diliman, Lallana took up teaching Political Science in 1979, where once he was designated Acting Chair of his department. While teaching in UP, he was also appointed Director of the Center for Integrative Development Studies, one of the University’s leading research units which regularly publishes research work on social issues and other challenges that confront Philippine society.

Lallana’s fascination with what can now be considered his advocacy began during his time as a graduate student in Hawaii, when he started using a laptop computer for his studies. And as a political scientist, he was not only enamored by the technology, but also with its potentials in improving research, education, public service, and governance. He earned his Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degrees from the University of Hawaii at Manoa in 1982 and 1986, respectively.

According to Lallana, digital transformation is different from digitalization. Digitalization is the mere adoption of electronic devices and work processes for analog devices and procedures. Digital transformation on the other hand requires not only a change in instruments and practices, but more importantly, in the mindset towards how an organization performs its functions and delivers its services to its stakeholders.

At the end of the interview, Atty. Roberto M. Lara, Secretary of the University and of the Board of Regents (OSU), announced: “Ako ang pinaka-gwapong naging Secretary ng UP.”

After a beat of silence, he reconsidered what he had said, “Sabagay, patay na yata lahat ng naging lalaking Secretary of the University, ano?”

Thus, because none of the male University Secretaries in the past are still alive to possibly  protest, he jokingly declared once again: “Ako ang pinaka-gwapong Secretary ng UP!”

Simply no place like (UP College) Manila

A few minutes into the interview and already one gets the feeling that conversations with Sec. Lara are rarely boring. A proud UP graduate, he earned his degree in Bachelor of Arts in Social Science in 1982 from UP Manila (UPM). Back then, it was the UP College Manila, when it was still under UP Diliman before becoming an autonomous university.

“If you are a working student, you inevitably ended up in UP College Manila, kasi Manila lang ang may evening classes and I was a working student,” recalled Lara, who worked as a clerk at the Department of Justice, “Clerk 1, which is I think one rank higher than the janitor,” he said. Most of the students in UPM at the time were freshmen and sophomores, at least until 5:30 PM, when classes for working students in their third and fourth year in college began.

“Masaya Manila noon!” enthused Lara, whose fondest memories of his undergrad days tend to range from PG-13 to R-18. For instance, there were the White House and the Doctor’s Club, which had to have the stuffiest establishment names ever, but which were actually popular watering holes frequented by UP students for the cheap beer they sold. And of course, right outside the campus was Mabini Street which, Lara pointed out, was already the lively Mabini Street even back then.

He experienced both the UP Manila and UP Diliman of the 70s and 80s, having earned his Bachelor of Laws degree from the College of Law in 1987. He was admitted to the Bar a year later, and went on to earn his Masters of Law degree in Commercial Law at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) in 1999.

Over the years, he worked in various government agencies, including as Senior Technical Assistant to then Senator Rene A.V. Saguisag, and as Chief of Staff of former BIR Commissioner Liwayway Vinzons-Chato. He left government service in 1998 and went into private law practice until February 2017, when then UP President Danilo Concepcion appointed him Secretary of the University and the Board of Regents.

 

“Of course, I am very proud to carry the mace. Siempre, you’re carrying the symbol of the authority of the University.” – Lara

Vice President for Legal Affairs Abraham Rey M. Acosta in his interview with the UP Forum. Photo by Abraham Arboleda, UP MPRO.

 

“We better assume a new role, aside from the traditional role…. This time, we should also provide legal assistance to those who engage the communities.” – Acosta

 

Atty. Abraham Rey M. Acosta, UP’s Vice President for Legal Affairs, envisions his office to serve a more dynamic role during the Presidency of Atty. Angelo Jimenez, to be “lawyers for the people and not just lawyers for the UP administration,” since UP, under Republic Act 9500 or the UP Charter, is mandated to be a public service university.

The Office of the Vice President for Legal Affairs (OVPLA) provides timely and expert legal advice, guidance, and support to UP officials, to facilitate the University’s pursuit of its mission of teaching, research, and service. It also handles administrative cases, student disciplinary tribunal cases, cases involving UP properties, and contracts being entered into by UP, among others.

“One of the priorities of the current administration is engagement with the public. We show the nation what UP really is, who we truly are, and that engagement will also require legal support,” Acosta said. He explained that UP’s students, researchers, staff, and teachers doing field work, advocacy and volunteer work, and other University-linked activities in various communities and sectors of society, often encounter situations that require legal assistance. However, when problems occur, like harassment or arrests, students and faculty members immediately contact public interest lawyers’ groups for help and not UP’s own lawyers.

“We better assume a new role, aside from the traditional role…. This time, we should also provide legal assistance to those who engage the communities,” Acosta further stated.

Prior to his appointment as VP for Legal Affairs, Atty. Acosta practiced law in Cebu, taking on dispute resolution, patent drafting, prosecution and litigation, and corporate registrations and housekeeping. He served as Municipal Administrator in Compostela, Cebu (2022-2023), as Partner in A Acosta & Associates Law Offices (since 2014), and as Associate in Quisumbing Torres (2011-2014) and Sycip Salazar Hernandez & Gatmaitan. He also served as Director of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) Cebu City Chapter (2021-2023), and as Co-Chair of the IBP Cebu City Legal Aid Committee, which handles developmental legal aid, volunteer legal aid caravans, and jail decongestion, among others.

Atty. Acosta has also been teaching Criminal Law as Senior Lecturer in the UP College of Law since 2020. His advice to students: study hard but also do volunteer work, and enjoy UP.

“Enjoy UP! UP has a lot of things to offer, especially if you live on campus. Even if you don’t live on campus, ang daming pwedeng gawin, pwedeng maaral,” he said.

“Go near the College of Music and you will hear wonderful music. Go to the College of Science, you will see lots of lectures, in the College of Engineering… [attend] free public lectures. Ang daming pwedeng matutunan ng UP students, kaya nga don’t just stay in your classroom. Lumabas din, kahit within UP lang.”

“And if possible, volunteer outside UP. Because even as a UP student, meron na tayong responsibilidad sa bayan natin. Bayad yung tuition natin ng sambayanan eh, kaya kahit konti naman maybe we can volunteer our time. Kahit yung mga reading initiatives sa mga public libraries, teaching kids how to read, or tumulong sa mga barangay natin, to show that, us being UP students, this is what UP students are like. Engage the community. Volunteer. Yun yung gusto kong sabihin sa mga students natin,” Acosta exhorted.

VP Acosta was a dormer, student council member, and campus journalist during his undergraduate years in UP Diliman. He was editor-in-chief of the Logscript, the official student publication of the College of Engineering. Elected Councilor in 1995, he headed the Community Rights and Welfare Committee of the University Student Council (USC). He joined the news section of the Philippine Collegian after his term in the USC. Molave Residence Hall was his “home away from home” for four years.

If you happen to visit Art Circle Café in the UP Diliman campus, odds are you might see a bespectacled man enjoying a cup coffee and a meal. Don’t be surprised if this person turns out to be Professor Wendell Capili as that café happens to be his favorite spot in the campus. Yet at first glance, people would never assume that this distinguished looking professor-type enjoys romantic comedy movies, runs as a hobby, and loves eating sapin-sapin, his favorite Filipino snack.

Dr. Jose Wendell P. Capili is currently the UP Vice President for Public Affairs (VPPA). A Professor 12 at the Department of English and Comparative Literature in UP Diliman, his favorite subject to teach is Filipino literature in English.

He also cannot live without his mobile phone. He says that when he wakes up in the morning, the first thing he does is to check his phone for messages.

Making good on a promise

Capili has had a very long and personal history with the University of the Philippines. His earliest memory of UP was during a trip with his father when he was seven years old. “We were driving to a relative’s house in Tandang Sora, and we briefly stopped the car.” His father pointed out the UP campus to the boy, and told him that this would be the place where he would soon learn, and be educated.

Capili made good on that promise, teaching in UP as a professor for 35 years. He also spent 25 of those years serving as a University administrator: as a program development associate to UP Diliman Chancellor Claro T. Laguno and Chancellor Emerlinda R. Roman from 1997 to 2001, and as Associate Dean of the UP College of Arts and Letters for nine years. He then became Assistant Vice President (AVP) for Public Affairs for fourteen years, serving under six UP VPs for Public Affairs and three UP Presidents.

 

“We have to ensure that more Filipinos feel that UP is there for them. That UP is not just for the Iskolar ng Bayan; UP is for the Filipino people.” – Capili

From the ground up

When asked about his initial reaction to being appointed as the Vice President for Media Public Affairs, Capili said he was very surprised. Up until that point, he was already considering going back to his home department and taking on a full-time teaching load.

“I thought that it was already the end of my career as an administrator and that I should spend more time as a University professor.” Although he had conditioned himself mentally to teach full time, he nevertheless accepted the new position that was given to him.

Of course, appointing someone with an academic and administrative career as long and impressive as his as the next UP VP for Public Affairs was a logical move on the part of the new administration. According to Capili, his experience of serving under six different VPs and three different UP Presidents will enable him not just to understand how the Office of the Vice President of Public Affairs is run, but also to see himself as an instrument between different sectors of the University.

“I really started from the bottom. I came from the gutter. Getting into the University, I snuck my way in,” he said of his beginnings in UP he as a temporary instructor with a yearly contract for several years before gaining tenure.

The importance of kindness in UP

Capili knows all about the struggles many UP staff and community members face. He knows what it’s like to be hungry, to have his salaries delayed and his overload pay withheld for years, to not even have the luxury of having his own office. He is well aware of the fact that there are problems that need to be resolved within the University, and if someone like him, with the highest rank of a Professor 12, feels the bitterness of these struggles, then how much worse is it for administrative staff, instructors and part-time UP contractual workers?

“I hope I can be an instrument to getting things done. Not necessarily solving these issues right away, but be the instrument, pointing out which office should attend to their needs.”"

He looked around the College of Engineering Faculty Lounge, trying to recall what the room had been before. And while he could not immediately remember, Ferdinand Jesus “Boyet” Aquino Pecson knew he was home.

The new UP Vice President for Development earned his BS Mechanical Engineering and PhD in Energy Engineering degrees from UP Diliman, where he taught for 11 years. The Faculty Lounge was at that time the Department of Metallurgical and Mining Engineering, informally called “Met and Mining”. His eyes lit up in instant recognition when he was told that.

Three decades is a long time to be away, and now that he is back in the University, Pecson has imposed upon himself the duty to contribute to the growth of UP.

“I owe a lot of where I am today to UP.”

How his UP journey began

“At 16, you had no idea. Engineering was popular,” he said on picking a college program while still a senior at San Beda College High School. A close friend encouraged him to take Mechanical Engineering. Pecson chose UP.

First girlfriend, first failed exam, first honorific achievement. These were some of the more memorable experiences he had at UP. Back then, he didn’t really think about balancing school and social life. He had a girlfriend, his barkada, Beta Epsilon Fraternity, and he finished within the required five years.

After graduating in 1981, he joined the faculty. “In the beginning, I made a lot of mistakes,” Pecson admitted. “We had no formal training on how to teach, so all we had were experiences from our former professors.” He picked what were worth emulating and avoided what he didn’t want his students to go through. He wanted to ensure that his students’ stay in UP would be worthwhile. “My teaching philosophy was ‘adapt to the needs of students.’” Pecson said that learning about his former students’ achievements made him “proud to have somehow been part of their growth.”

He worked on his PhD while teaching and got a USAID grant to do his dissertation at the University of Wisconsin. This would be his first chance to travel abroad. He was expected to present his research output at an international conference and did so at the Argonne National Laboratory at the 1988 symposium of The Combustion Institute. He then got his PhD from UP and taught until 1992.


“I owe a lot of where I am today to UP. This time, I can contribute to my alma mater.” – Pecson


A career outside 

Pecson expanded his horizons and built a solid professional career in the private sector for the next 24 years. He worked at Philippine Investment Management Consultants, Inc. and Solid Cement Corporation before going to the US to take Northwestern University’s MMM Program. It was a two-year dual-degree offering that allowed him to earn a Master of Business Administration from the Kellogg School of Management and a Master of Engineering Management from the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science in 2000. He stayed in the US for two more years.

Then he was with Holcim Philippines for almost seven years as VP (Alternative Fuels and Raw Materials) and later as VP for Operations. After that, he joined FLSmidth & Co. A/S., first, as operations and maintenance (O&M) consultant, where he worked in various countries, then as Egypt country manager, and finally, as performance director at its headquarters in Denmark

In 2016, he went back to government service. Pecson was appointed Undersecretary and Executive Director of the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Center. He believed his O&M experience fit the life cycle approach of PPP. He also credited his social network—people who knew him would vouch for and recommend him—for getting the job.

After six years, his term ended. For someone who led an active lifestyle (he was a finisher at the 2019 Ironman 70.3 competition in Subic Bay) and who married the equally active Marietta who ran marathons, Pecson didn’t want to look at retirement, especially when he and his wife have been empty-nesters for years. He became a PPP consultant, created a PPP blog, and traveled to Bhutan."

“I’m Nestor Yunque, the present Vice President for Administration. I started as VP for Administration way back in 2017.  And now, under the new UP President, I’m continuing to help stabilize everything.”

As a professor who taught zoology, marine biology, and environmental science courses at the University of the Philippines Visayas (UPV) College of Arts and Sciences-Division of Biological Sciences before taking on higher administrative positions, Vice President for Administration Nestor G. Yunque said he made learning interesting for his students by organizing class field trips.

“That makes life exciting.  Ayokong ma-confine sa four corners ng classroom ang pag-aaral… It is also a form of service to the students,” said VP Nes, adding: “Nag-uumapaw yung estudyante kasi alam nilang magfi-field trip…. From Iloilo, we pass by Antique, then Aklan, overnight sa Boracay, pag-uwi, dadaan sa Roxas. It’s a tour of Panay, and they spend so much less than if they’re going to do that on their own.”

In his lectures, he would emphasize that UP students should care. “Whatever your course is—business management or biology, or chemistry or math—always bear in mind na yung pag-aaral mo, eventually, should help people. Bigyan mo ng halaga ang mga mahihirap,” he would tell them.

VP Nes, who grew up during the First Quarter Storm era, recalls his student days at the Philippine Science High School in Quezon City and in the UP Visayas. “Gusto mo yung gobyerno, yung serbisyo, para sa tao, hindi sa kapitalista o sa kagrupo nila,” he said.

He and his peers belong to the generation that organized massive rallies and campaigned for the reestablishment of the student councils. “At that time [Martial Law], lahat ng student councils ng UP units ay tinanggal. Later on, may clamor na ibalik ang student council sa bawat CU. Sa UP Visayas, we did that. Lahat ng organizations nagtipon.” As chairperson of the aggrupation, he led the students in bringing back the student council in UPV.

After college, he served as a research assistant for work on agar production and commercially important seaweeds for two years, before becoming a faculty member of the UPV. Eventually, he was assigned as the station head of the UP Visayas Marine Biological Station in Taklong Island in Guimaras.

When he was the Vice Chancellor for Administration of UPV in Iloilo, from 2011 to 2016, he cherished establishing rapport with administrative personnel and the moments he got to know about their problems and how the administration would be able to address them.  “During that time, it was for two terms, we were able to initiate changes in how the administration is being run,” he said.

 

“Hopefully, magtulungan talaga ang lahat ng sectors para gumanda ang takbo, ang performance ng Unibersidad. Then, we could expect more.” – Yunque

 

 

VP Nes has been in charge of UP’s human resources, compensation and benefits, union and management relations, procurement and related administrative matters since 2017.

In UP Diliman, VP Nes feels at home at the tambayan in front of the All UP Workers Union office. Referring to the Union, he said: “I feel na nagtulungan kami. Kasi hindi ko naman pwedeng gawin yung trabaho na magiging effective ako without the cooperation ng ating mga admin personnel.”

VP Nes, whose favorite snack consists simply of Skyflakes crackers and a cup of coffee, is particularly jovial in the company of UP employees and faculty, enjoying casual conversations when outside of his office in Quezon Hall. He explained that he prefers to spend his downtime in campus in the company of UP’s administrative personnel, carpenters, plumbers, drivers.

So what made you come back to UP?

“I’ve been asking myself that question for the past month,” lightly answered Ms. Iryn Y. Balmores, the newly appointed UP Vice President for Planning and Finance (VPPF).

First, what actually happened: With his official takeover of the UP Presidency in February 2023, Atty. Angelo Jimenez tapped seasoned members of past UP administrations and alumni leaders from private sectors alike to become members of his executive team. This included Ms. Iryn Y. Balmores, Chief Finance Officer (CFO) at BasicLogistics Corporation/A 1Move Logistics, Inc., and former Head of Finance for a medium-scale trading and distribution company (2016-2021) and Senior Tax Director at Sycip Gorres Velayo and Co. from 2008-2015.

A proud UP alumna and certified public accountant (CPA), Balmores hopes to use her decades of experience in audit, finance and taxation, including strategic finance, reporting, general accounting and compliance, and mergers and acquisitions by giving back to the University.

Balmores shares the fact that having celebrated a milestone birthday last February, her appointment as UP VP for Planning and Finance came at the perfect time.

“When this possibility of working for the UP System, working for the new administration with UP President Jimenez [came], I thought it was a good time to give back,” she added. 

She had a very short stint with government work and accounting back in the early 2000’s. “That was a long time ago and I was very young then,” she recalled. So now, this new role with the University, while outside of her comfort zone, is a welcome challenge.

Coming into the office, she hints at issues that are yet to be resolved but that don’t dim her excitement for the job at hand. “It wouldn’t be any fun otherwise—ang boring kung walang ganoon,” she said.

Being thrust into a new environment, together with new people and new working cultures, makes this job even more thrilling for her. And acknowledging that her responsibilities as University Vice President is of public interest makes it even more worthwhile. 

Fresh pair of eyes

Balmores describes herself as an outsider coming into the position, a balikbayan returning home to her roots.

“I was already set on early retirement. I took a week to decide.”

Dr. Leo De Paz Cubillan narrated how he became UP’s new Vice President for Academic Affairs (VPAA). That week was one of contemplation for the ophthalmologist who wanted to see things more clearly. After studying how he could contribute to UP, he drew up plans and presented them to then-incoming UP President Angelo Jimenez. Cubillan has been VPAA since April, but he was previously the President’s adviser for academic and research development during the Office of the VPAA’s (OVPAA) transition.

“The decision was difficult, but there was a higher calling.” He and his wife, Dr. Eileen Liesl Abesamis Cubillan, have been empty nesters for more than five years. He wanted more time with his children abroad, but the pull of service proved stronger, something he had felt since wanting to become a doctor and being in UP.

Student, doctor, teacher 

Growing up in Surigao, Cubillan’s dream of becoming of a doctor started when he played the role of one in an elementary school play. Initially, he wasn’t even going to UP. Because the release of UP College Admission Test results came much later than those of other schools, he was already enrolled in another school. It was his parents’ friends who persuaded them that UP was the place for him.

So, armed with a National Science and Technology Authority scholarship, he moved to UP Diliman (UPD) in 1982 under the AB Humanities pre-med program. He was 16 and homesick, going to Cubao just to call home. But he also kept his focus, shifting to BS Biology as it was a better pre-med program. “When there were dorm activities, I would go somewhere else to study,” he remembered.

Graduating magna cum laude, Cubillan was named “Most Outstanding Graduate” in the first batch from the newly elevated Institute of Biology, and gained admission to the College of Medicine (CM) in UP Manila (UPM). It was another adjustment; from the sprawling UPD campus, he now found himself in cramped UPM. He was swamped with daily lectures from 7AM to 7PM and weekly exams. But it was in the flurry of med school that he met his future wife, two years his junior. Cubillan did his fellowship at the UP Philippine General Hospital (PGH) while waiting for her to finish the Dermatology program.

In 1998, the couple then went on fellowships to the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Cubillan was already a university researcher at the UPM National Institutes of Health (NIH) Philippine Eye Research Institute (PERI) and a CM clinical associate professor. In his second year at UCSF, he took the Master of Public Health at UC Berkeley. He believed it would help him “contribute to the improvement of health care in our country” because of the issues in health care access he saw during his UP-PGH clinical training.

“The decision was difficult, but there was a higher calling.” – Cubillan

May 13, 2022 | Written by Maria Diosa Labiste and Yvonne T. Chua



Spurious last-ditch reports of candidates being disqualified and a buildup of fabricated vote tallies of presidential contenders took hold of social media as voters trooped to precincts last Monday.

This was observed by Tsek.ph, based on the consortium’s live fact-checking efforts on Election Day.

The misleading and deceptive narratives on election day largely targeted now presumptive president Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and his rival, Vice President Leni Robredo; their running mates, Sara Duterte and Francis Pangilinan; progressive party-list groups and the Commission of Elections.

These wefts in a pattern of disinformation not only sought to influence voters’ choices but also convey an impression that winners had already been picked even before polling closed. These in turn could undermine confidence in the credibility of this year’s elections as an exercise in democracy.

Led by the UPCMC Journalism Department, a one-day newsroom was organized for Tsek.ph partners to come together for live and continuous fact-checking on election day. Tsek.ph is a collaborative fact-checking initiative of 34 partners from academe, media and civil society. It is supported by the University of the Philippines, Google News Initiative, Rakuten Viber, Meta, Meedan and the Embassy of Canada.

Fake vote tallies

Polling precincts were hours away from closing and votes had yet to be counted, but social media were swamped with manufactured tallies of election results showing either Marcos or Robredo leading the race.

Comelec Resolution 10695 stipulates that counting and consolidation of votes, including those from overseas absentee voting, shall be held on May 9 after the casting of votes and closing of polls at 7 p.m.

Both Marcos and Robredo had their fair share of fake tallies that day. Tsek.ph partners published 10 fact checks on various claims declaring Marcos leading in partial counts, two in which he and Duterte were winning, and another two with Duterte dominating the count.

Five fact checks were about Robredo taking the lead and one declaring that both she and Pangilinan had won overseas absentee votes by a landslide. Interestingly, one claim showed Robredo and Duterte the winners.


The false narratives were overwhelmingly pushed on Facebook, and occasionally on Twitter and YouTube, mostly by Marcos supporters, including Showbiz Fanaticz channel whose election-related claims have been previously fact-checked.

Nearly all the posts utilized eye-catching graphics. Some tried to mimic the interface of mainstream media such as Rappler’s live election results and TV5’s infographic on the media reach and engagement of candidates. Both were passed off as real poll results.

One netizen ran a graphic culled from Robredo’s Facebook post in 2016 that showed her ahead of Marcos in the vice presidential contest at the time. Marcos bitterly contested the results, alleging electoral irregularities. The Supreme Court dismissed his petition last year.

The fake election results came out as early as 8:27 a.m. or about two-and-a-hours after the polls opened. They showed Marcos supposedly leading over Robredo and Manila Mayor Francisco “Isko” Moreno Domagoso. A bogus vice presidential vote count showing Duterte far ahead in the election was posted 11:55 a.m.

Some posts gained traction in just a few hours. A tally falsely claiming Duterte was in the lead chalked up 2,898 interactions. A post announcing the Robredo-Pangilinan tandem’s landslide victory abroad, also rated false, picked up 3,514 interactions.

I am a Filipino–inheritor of a glorious past, hostage to the uncertain future. As such I must prove equal to a two-fold task–the task of meeting my responsibility to the past, and the task of performing my obligation to the future.

I sprung from a hardy race, child many generations removed of ancient Malayan pioneers. Across the centuries the memory comes rushing back to me: of brown-skinned men putting out to sea in ships that were as frail as their hearts were stout. Over the sea I see them come, borne upon the billowing wave and the whistling wind, carried upon the mighty swell of hope–hope in the free abundance of new land that was to be their home and their children’s forever.

Nixie E. Serna
Magna cum laude
BA in English (Creative Writing)
College of Humanities and Social Sciences
University of the Philippines Mindanao

 

I am Nixie E. Serna, 23 years old, from Surigao City. I studied BA in English (Creative Writing) at the University of the Philippines Mindanao and graduated Magna cum laude. As a creative writer, it is given that you have to be interested in reading and, of course, writing. At a young age, I had always been drawn to books. I usually spent my free time browsing in the library from the time I was in grade school. I would also spend the little money I saved from my ten-peso allowance to buy those booklets sold by visitors in school back then. Eventually, reading compelled me to write because I also wanted to create my own stories.

My undergraduate thesis was an essay collection titled, Seismic, for which I received the Thesis with Distinction award. The essay collection was on disasters, particularly the 2017 earthquake in Surigao, the 2019 earthquake swarm in Davao, super typhoon Odette in 2021, the effects of the pandemic, and other personal disasters I have experienced. Some of my works have also been published in the Philippine Daily Inquirer Youngblood column, Life UPdates of Likhaan: UP Institute of Creative Writing, Dagmay.online, and Mindanews.

Aside from reading and writing, I also draw in both traditional and digital media. I run an art account on social media; and you can find me on Instagram and Twitter by the username @nikushiisan. Most of my drawings are fanarts of media I like such as anime, K-pop, movies, or TV shows. I rarely upload drawings nowadays because of my busy schedule, but I try my best to draw every now and then to keep my skills sharp. One of my goals is to one day improve my art so that I can also illustrate my own stories and characters or produce illustrations for Filipino writers.

In addition to reading, writing, and drawing, one of the hobbies that take my mind off the stress of academics and other matters is listening to K-pop songs, particularly the group EXO. I am an EXO stan or an EXO-L which is the official name of their fandom. I follow this K-pop group because of their diverse and great discography, artistry, and dedication to their fans. I also always keep in mind this quote by Kai, one of the members of EXO, about studying to motivate myself, “If you’re not good at studying, don’t even think about liking me. . . . Focus more on your studies than us and meet us again proudly in the future.” I do hope I can meet them at their concert in the future.

 

Overcoming financial constraints

My parents primarily supported me in my studies. However, there are four of us siblings in the family and their minimum wage is not enough to send us to school. As the eldest child, I had to find ways to fund my education. The Free Tertiary Education Law greatly helped me in achieving a higher education. Otherwise, it would have been difficult for me to enroll in college, especially in UP, considering that UP Mindanao is very far away from my hometown.

Since my first year, I applied to the Student Learning Assistance System of UP so that I could receive a stipend to help me with my studies. Through the stipend I saved, I was able to buy a laptop and pay for the internet bill, both of which were necessary not only during face-to-face classes but especially during online classes due to the pandemic. During my second year, I applied for a scholarship sponsored by the UP Mindanao Foundation Inc. They were meticulous in accepting their scholars by checking their academic standing and economic background, but thankfully, I was accepted. Every semester, I would renew my scholarship by submitting my grades. Even during that time when we were devastated by super typhoon Odette in 2021, I persevered in completing my requirements so that I could renew my scholarship. I am immensely grateful to UPMFI and the taxpayers who helped me finish my education. I would surely use what I have learned in the University by giving back to the people.

 

Dealing with disasters

Aside from financial constraints, my college life was nothing short of disasters. Like my fellow batchmates, I had to endure the challenges brought by the pandemic in 2020, including the shift to online classes which took a toll on our mental health because of isolation. My parents were laid off from work and we had to rely on the cash assistance and ayuda from the government to sustain us. Around the height of the pandemic on September 2020, our house was also demolished since the lot it was standing on was sold to a new owner. We are temporarily living right now in a house that was intended for the stay-in employee of my mother’s employers. To sum up, we currently have no fixed abode because we do not have our own house.

In October 2021, my father suffered a mild stroke and had to stop working to recover. We were able to get by and buy his maintenance medicine through the support of our relatives and family friends. As if we were not struggling enough, my hometown was leveled by super typhoon Odette in December 2021. Our roof was blown away and everything under it got soaked. For more than a month, we had no electricity, mobile signal, and we only had an intermittent water supply. I was in my third year at that time and it was around finals when the super typhoon struck. To comply with my remaining requirements, I went to charging stations to charge our flashlights and devices while I read my readings. At night by candlelight, I would write my papers by hand and then type them on my phone when I was able to charge the battery. I also contacted my professors once the mobile signal returned and relayed to them my situation. Despite the setbacks, I was able to submit my requirements on time. One of my professors told me that it was miraculous how I surpassed those challenges. Looking back, I sometimes cannot believe how I survived all of that. I was driven by my desire to win against my situation and I succeeded with the help of the people around me.

Cum laude
BS Food Technology
College of Science and Mathematics, University of the Philippines Mindanao

 

My name is Virgilio Roi C. Adaptar, 24 years old, born and raised in Davao City, and people call me VR. I am a graduate of the BS Food Technology program at the College of Science and Mathematics, University of the Philippines Mindanao.

My research interests include probiotics, valorization of local produces and agricultural by-products, and nutrition, all anchored on the principles of inclusivity and sustainability.

I used to compete as an Adjudicator in the UP Mindanao Debate Society, and was able to represent the University in various debating competitions and tournaments around the country.

Also, together with my fellow DOST Scholars, I am one of the founding members of the UP Mindanao League of DOST Scholars, the first and the official association of DOST Scholars in the University. I eventually served as the Founding President of the organization, and held various leadership positions throughout my residency.

I am also an active member of the U.S. Government Alumni Association -Davao, the regional chapter of international exchange alumni of U.S. Government-funded exchange and internationalization programs.

I attended McNeese State University during the Fall 2021 semester under the Global Undergraduate Exchange Program (Global UGrad) through the U.S. Department of State, World Learning, and Fulbright Philippines. Upon coming home, I then became an active member of the Global UGrad Scholars of the Philippines Alumni Association.

Overcoming financial difficulties

Growing up, I was well aware of my family’s financial struggles. Scholarships, subsidies, side hustles — these sustained my financial needs throughout my studies. I started taking commissions and part-time jobs way back in high school, because even though I had a scholarship, it did not fully cover all fees and I had to find ways and means for my daily allowance and other expenses. I also saw how difficult it was for my mother to make a living and did not want to keep asking from her anymore. 

In college, I was awarded an undergraduate scholarship from the Science Education Institute of DOST, which really helped ease the financial burden. Despite the generous amount I received every semester from DOST, I still opted to do side hustles as the stipend I received was still not enough for me as a self-supporting student in this economic climate. I used to do events hosting, ghostwriting for blogs and other online platforms, arts and crafts commissions, tutorials for elementary and high school students, and eventually I became a call center agent, and later on transitioned into being a freelance virtual assistant. I should say, being a working student was difficult and would not want to romanticize it. If I only had the option and the privilege to be a full-time student, I would not want to work while studying just to make ends meet. 

I am not that typical “straight uno” student who would often be celebrated for academic prowess. I would rather refer to myself as a student who had the capacity to endure. This led me to being selected as one of the four Filipino students, and the only Mindanaoan, for the prestigious Global Undergraduate Exchange Program for the Fall 2021 batch. Furthermore, grit enabled me to pursue my undergraduate thesis on non-dairy probiotics which also utilized local agricultural by-products. My study won 1st Place in the Oral Research Presentation (Undergraduate Category) of the Philippine Society for Microbiology Mindanao 27th Annual Convention and Scientific Meeting and was nominated as finalist for Best Thesis (Basic and Applied Research Category) in the Department of Food Science and Chemistry of our Ccollege. Currently, I am working towards getting it published in a scientific journal. Finally, I was able to shift my Sablay from right to left when I graduated cum laude last July.

Hardships before becoming an Iskolar ng Bayan

When I was 12, someone power-tripped me and said “You do not deserve to be an honor student,” and slammed their fists on the table. Some people even expected the 12-year -old me to just easily move on from that experience, and that I was just overreacting. Of course, not everyone believes in mental health and trauma. And yes, being an honor student in elementary is not really that big of a deal for a lot of people, but the young and naïve 12-year -old me felt invalidated.

When I was 14, my family faced a huge financial problem and finishing high school was almost taken away from me. I remember seeing my mom, swallowing her pride to ask for help from others whenever I needed something for school, yet she would often be rejected or humiliated. I could even remember some relatives asking me to just drop out of school since class grades “cannot be eaten” and that I should just start working instead to be more useful to the family.

At present, my anxiety is still triggered by all those words said. I still get nightmares once in a while and I still wonder about what goes on in the minds of those people, if they think about what they’ve done, what stories they’ve told their friends, family, and other people. I haven’t exactly figured out how to let the trauma and anxiety go away. Most of the time, I just distract myself.

College seemed to be a great opportunity to pursue more things “to distract myself” and grow up from what happened in the past. And in a place like UP where freedom is highly valued, I felt more free to blaze my own trail and make the most out of my time as an eager young adult.

Org life in UP

With the freedom that we all enjoy in UP, organizations served as a meaningful avenue to grow and develop beyond classrooms and laboratories.

Through the UP Mindanao Debate Society, I was able to enjoy the art of discourse, meet new people in tournaments, and find a safe space among my co-residents. Debating taught me innovative thinking and problem-solving., Aand much more than these, it made me realize the importance of being aware of the issues that we face in society, and that talking about these issues sheds light on the real problems and lived experiences of the various sectors of society, and that the more we talk about these, the more attention we can bring to them to help shake up the status quo.

Moreover, I never initially envisioned that I’ll be a part of a bunch of people behind establishing a new organization. We were freshies back then and we often asked the same question again and again if UP Mindanao already has its own organization for DOST Scholars. Until we ourselves answered our own question. We then established the UP Mindanao League of DOST Scholars (UPMin LeaDS). Not long after, I found myself taking the lead as its founding president. From dancing “batis” during our first Patriot Scholars Formation Program, being duly recognized as a student organization on campus, launching our first project and initiative, and organizing the first Congress we attended as an org; to taking new leadership roles in the organization (as if I was playing “Trip to Jerusalem” and being surprised as to where I would end up next), being a rallying point for academic and moral support for our fellow scholars and aspiring ones, helping revive and mobilize the regional organization of DOST Scholars in Davao, struggling through the chaotic times during the pandemic (and getting a lot of anxious, worried, and confused messages from fellow scholars, all uncertain of what might happen next), and everything in between, I was grateful for the opportunity to initiate and lead. I know that the org is still far from being what it is envisioned to be and that I did have my lapses and shortcomings and a lot of unfinished business and what ifs as a leader, but I am grateful for the trust and confidence shown by the people around me and I am excited to see what’s next for UPMin LeaDS.

Being a working student

My org life in UP sounded fun and stress-free, right? Here’s what was happening beyond the org meetings, projects, and events.

I was not born with a silver spoon, and of course, society is unfair to those who are not that privileged.

At some point, I felt that I was easily exploited by others who saw my background as an opportunity to manipulate and make it work to their advantage, but I did not have much time to think about it back then. I was too preoccupied with the need to put in extra work, to make the most out of meager resources, to always be on the lookout for the next available “raket”, to think of ways on how I could make it from one paycheck to another, from one month’s stipend to the next, to juggle one job and another, switching lanyards or IDs from one shift at work to try to make it on time to the next class in school. I had to look for ways to augment my income while trying to meet deadlines and studying for exams because no one else would.

Hard work is often set as the ultimate factor behind success and our society loves seeing or hearing “rags-to-riches” stories to the point where poverty is romanticized and accepted as a norm. In an ideal world, hard work may be the sole and primary factor for success but we are far from being in that ideal world.

As a Ffood Ttechnology major, I struggled to go through a typical day in college. It was even more magnified when I was already doing my thesis with very minimal funding. I hope that someday, access and support for quality scientific education will be available for all those who aspire to be researchers, engineers, doctors, educators, scientists, and mathematicians;, and that we may move past being a society that oppresses, deprives, and excludes.

If hard work or “sipag” was the only factor to achieve success, other working students like me should have already been assured of a more comfortable life straight out of college, right? Farmers and laborers would probably be as glorified and celebrated as CEOs and world leaders. However, we are definitely not in an ideal world where hard work is the sole factor behind success.

Plot twist 

No, this is not going to be a college love story.

Instead, we go back to one random morning during my sophomore year. It was around 8 AM and I just got out of my graveyard shift at work. My first class for the day, organic chemistry, was at 8:30 and with the one- to two-hour commute from the office to the campus, it would always be impossible for me to make it in time for class.

Towards the middle of the semester, I realized that by being a student by day and working the night shift as a call center agent, I would most likely fail in the class. I thought to myself that if I eventually get a 5.0 in my transcript, I should have some redeeming factor to make up for the anticipated failing grade.

The universe was telling me to let go of my graveyard shift job and just be a full-time student, which was not really sitting well with me given my situation.

I was ready to get my first 5.0 in UP and started to look for options on what I could do to compensate for that in my transcript.

Attend workshops? More debating? Start doing internships (and a lot of them)? Join fellowships? Join another org? Go on an exchange program?

Coincidentally, another professor of mine invited us to an exchange programs roadshow hosted by Fulbright Philippines and I learned about the Global Undergraduate Exchange Program (Global UGrad).

The Global UGrad program is a semester-long exchange program in the United States participated in by over 60 countries that “brings future leaders to the United States to experience U.S. higher education, gain critical professional skills, and explore new cultures and values”.

Asst. Prof. Kriza Faye Calumba, who later on became my thesis adviser, was very instrumental in this endeavor as she encouraged me to apply and even agreed to write a recommendation letter supporting my application.

The things that happened next went in my favor: I got a 4.0 instead of a 5.0 and passed my removal examinations for organic chemistry, I let go of my night shift job and found another job with more flexible working hours, and I got into Global UGrad.

However, the pandemic happened and things went to a pause for a while. I was supposed to leave for the U.S. by August 2020 but the situation was still far from being under control. My program was eventually postponed to Fall 2021.

I will never forget August 12, 2021, –the day I traveled to the United States. Growing up in a family where studying in college seems like a shot to the moon, studying abroad was just as far-fetched. 

McNeese State University in Lake Charles, Louisiana became my home for the rest of the semester. I was able to explore concepts in nutrition and food production from an international perspective and also studied microbiology from a clinical perspective and learned about American History with the theme “What is the role of the United States — around the world and at home?”

Throughout my stay in the United States, I was also able to watch my first football game in Lousiana State University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, enjoy the art scene and authentic Texas brisket and barbecue in Austin, Texas, explore some caverns in San Antonio, Texas, visit the historic French Quarter in New Orleans, Louisiana, and celebrate Thanksgiving in Jacksonville, Florida. I also fulfilled a childhood dream of stepping foot inside a space center when I visited the NASA Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.

Furthermore, the community engagement component of Global UGrad also allowed me to connect with the community in Lake Charles, Louisiana, and get to know the locals, many of whom were still recovering from two devastating hurricanes that struck the area at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Being an exchange student means that you are also serving as a cultural ambassador of your country, and it was truly an honor to raise the flag of the Philippines. From introducing adobo to my American roommates, showing them the way we cook rice with the trusted finger method for measuring the right amount of water, sharing some OPM songs, teaching some Tagalog and Bisaya words to my American classmates, to assisting a research student in her study on plant-based yogurt, sharing a bit of our shared history between the Philippines and the U.S. in class, and connecting with Filipino-Americans in the area, I believe that I was able to make the most out of my stay in the United States.

Upon coming back home, I continued working on my undergraduate thesis, got involved again with more projects through my organizations, and actively helped in promoting exchange and internationalization opportunities for other Filipino students to help them widen their perspectives and further capacitate them in their chosen fields, and in return, apply what they learned in their respective communities.

Yes, I flew out during the Delta surge and went back home to the Philippines in the middle of the Omicron surge.

Study habits

I can’t say that I really have good study habits. I adjust depending on my mood and physical well-being (e.g., I postpone studying or doing academic work if I feel sick). I don’t force myself to study or do academic work if I still don’t feel like it because I will end up with half-baked or mediocre outputs. One thing that I think worked for me though, is reading or writing at night. I think the peaceful atmosphere between 10 in the evening until around dawn helped me focus, especially during the lockdowns during the pandemic where everyone was at home and awake during the day. Nevertheless, I think it’s a matter of “finding your own groove” and seeing what truly works for you when it comes to studying or doing academic work and requirements, because what worked for me might not be that effective for you. If all else fails, get some sleep.

I should also emphasize that the guidance and mentorship I received from my professors in UP Mindanao, especially the Department of Food Science and Chemistry, made this academic journey seem like I was standing on the shoulders of giants. The pandemic made the semesters too uncertain yet my professors remained nurturing and understanding, especially my adviser, Asst. Prof. Calumba, who truly lived up to her role as an adviser holistically and continued to believe in me at a time when self-doubt almost consumed me.

Teaching literature is impossible; that is why it is difficult.
–Northrop Frye

“Do you want to enhance your skills in reading and teaching literature? Do you want to learn how to uncover the hidden meanings and messages of literary texts?”

So reads the invitation to the Gemino H. Abad Seminar-Workshop (GASW) for Teaching Literature 2023, which was held from September 20 to 22 at the NISMED Auditorium in UP Diliman. The GASW is a project of the Likhaan UP Institute of Creative Writing, and aims to inspire and empower educators with the ultimate goal of fostering a love for literature among Filipino students. The 48 participants were junior and senior high school teachers of literature and creative writing in English from public and private schools nationwide, and the lecturers are some of the country’s most distinguished literary scholars and writers.

As a tribute to the joys and challenges of education, especially for teachers of literature and the humanities, we are sharing an article written by Dr. Vim Nadera, award-winning poet, fictionist, playwright, and essayist, at the conclusion of this year’s GASW. The article was originally published by the Pilipino Mirror.

Jessica Franco Perez
Magna cum laude
Doctor of Medicine
UP College of Medicine

 

I am Jessica Franco Perez, 32 years old, from San Mateo, Rizal. I studied BS Nutrition in UP Los Baños and graduated magna cum laude in 2011. I passed the Nutritionist-Dietitian Licensure Examination and became a Registered Nutritionist-Dietitian that same year.

I worked at the Dietary Department of the UP-Philippine General Hospital (PGH) as a clinical dietitian. I was assigned at the Nutrition Clinic of the Department of Out-Patient Services where I provided nutrition assessment, individualized diet plans, and educational lectures to patients, doctors, and paramedical professionals. While working at PGH, I was also given opportunities to participate in different researches.

I am a co-investigator in a research project of Dr. A.G. Limpoco of the Department of Family and Community Medicine, titled “Development and Evaluation of Rapid Eating Assessment for Patients (REAP) Tool”.  I also became part of several patient support groups, such as the Hansen’s Club, Lipat Kalinga, and Psoriasis Club.

After six years of working at PGH, I then applied to and got accepted in the University of the Philippines College of Medicine at the age of 28. I became a member of the UP Pangkalusugang Samahan ng mga Mag-aaral (UP PAGSAMA) where I served under the SocCon Force, a committee that focuses on social engagements and community organizing activities. In the recently conducted 114th Commencement Exercise of the UP College of Medicine, I finally got my Doctor of Medicine degree, graduating  magna cum laude and being one of the Top 5 Most Outstanding Graduates in Academics of our batch. I was also given recognition as one of the Top 3 Most Outstanding Interns of AY 2022-2023, being an outstanding intern in Medicine, Obstetrics & Gynecology, and Surgery.

 

Pursuing the dream

Photo courtesy of Jessica Perez.

I have always dreamt of becoming a doctor since I was a child. However, being born in a middle-class family, this dream seemed impossible. Being the second child in a brood of four, I also wanted to help my parents financially, especially in sending my younger sisters to college. I initially gave up on my dream of becoming a doctor and focused on a career still close to medicine. I was happy serving as a clinical dietitian. It was an equally fulfilling profession, having the opportunity to help other people through proper diet and a healthy lifestyle. However, I knew that some part of me was wishing and hoping I could still be a doctor someday. Every morning after I conducted lectures in the OPD waiting areas, seeing the long queue of people patiently waiting to be seen by a doctor, I had always felt the desire to serve more, both as a dietitian AND as a doctor.

When my youngest sibling was already in her last year in college, I asked myself, “Posible pa bang maging doctor ako? Ipu-pursue ko pa rin ba ang pagme-Med kahit na matanda na ako?” These doubts had been running through my mind for quite a while. I also did not want to be a burden to my family, especially to my mother, given the additional years of studying instead of earning money. Thankfully, my family and friends were very supportive and encouraged me to still try. As the famous line goes, “It is better to try and fail than to never know and wonder what could have been if I tried.” And so, I juggled work, the National Medical Admission Test review, and preparations for applications to medical schools.

With a limited amount of savings and overwhelming uncertainty, I found the courage to resign from the job I had treasured for six years to start this new journey. I was very blessed to be accepted in the UP College of Medicine, where I could have a subsidized, high quality medical education. Without the subsidized tuition fees, the scholarship grants from the College, the Pe Gan Heng Foundation, and the UP Medical Alumni Society of America (UPMASA), as well as the unending support of my family and friends, I may not have been able to reach this point."

UP History in the Making this September
September 8, 2023 | Written by Celeste Ann Castillo Llaneta



This September, UP historical events will take place.

From September 13 to 15, the University of the Philippines will hold three milestone events in Davao City, Davao del Sur, Mindanao, with all events marking firsts in the history of not just UP but the region as well. These include: a pioneering summit that puts the development of the Bangsamoro front and center in the national University’s strategic initiatives; the investiture ceremony for the first Mindanawan UP President, to be held for the first time on the UP Mindanao campus; and finally, the first UP-initiated summit gathering leaders of state universities and colleges from across the country with the aim of boosting engagement and partnerships in the Philippine higher education sector.

With these series of high profile events, the University sets itself squarely upon the path to become the national university it is meant to be, a public service university “doing what we can for others” as “Iskolar Para sa Bayan”, as UP President Angelo A. Jimenez said in his address to the UP Diliman Class of 2023. A national university serving the Filipino people, focusing specially on the country’s most underrepresented and marginalized communities.

 

The UP-Bangsamoro Development Program Summit Consultation
Date: September 13
Time: 1:00-5:00 PM
Venue: Dusit Thani Residences Davao

 

Mindanao has been envisioned as the country’s agri-industrial center, given its rich natural, economic and human development resources, its potentials, and its people’s aspirations.

However, growth and development in Mindanao has remained uneven, hampered by such issues as poverty, social conflicts, criminality and social unrest. The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), in particular, has seen a significant drop, among families, in poverty incidence, from 52.6% in 2018 to 29.95 in 2021; but it still ranks among the lowest in the Human Development Index list of Philippine regions and provinces.

In keeping with its mandate under Republic Act No. 9500 to take the lead in higher education and public service and to relate its activities to the needs and aspirations of all Filipinos, the University of the Philippines will host the UP-Bangsamoro Development Program Summit Consultation to discuss opportunities for collaboration aiming to improve the socio-economic conditions of the Bangsamoro and Mindanao. This will be held on Sept. 13, 2023, 1:00 PM at the Dusit Thani Residence Davao.

These include the creation of a UP-Bangsamoro Development Program, which would be the first of its kind between the University, the BARMM government and local government units, and development NGOs and SUCs in the region. The program is envisioned to serve as an avenue of convergence between UP and the Bangsamoro for co-creating opportunities and collaborative action to strengthen human capital and improve socio-economic conditions of the Bangsamoro.

Slated to attend the summit are: BARMM Chief Minister Ahod Ebrahim, Al Haj; officials and representatives of various ministries and committees of the Bangsamoro Parliament; and LGUs, NGOs, and state universities and colleges (SUCs) in the region. A memorandum of understanding between the University and the BTA will also be presented by the UP to its partners in the transition authority.

 

Panaad at Kabilin: Pagtatalaga kay Kgg. Angelo A. Jimenez bilang ika-22 Pangulo ng Unibersidad ng Pilipinas
[Investiture of Atty. Angelo A. Jimenez as 22nd President of the University of the Philippines]
Date: September 14, 2023
Time: 9:00 AM
Venue: UP Mindanao Atrium, Tugbok, Davao City, Davao del Sur

 

“The hallmark of UP in the next six years will be service to the nation. Service to the nation is constitutive of who we are and what we do. Together, we will work towards a UP that is more engaged with the nation,” Atty. Angelo A. Jimenez said in his speech on Feb. 10, when he accepted the position and authority of leading the University as its 22nd President.

Born and raised in the City of Butuan, Agusan del Norte, Jimenez is the first Mindanawan and the first Manobo, honored and named as “Datu Mankalagan” or “Great Spirit” in 2007, to become UP President. To mark the symbolic significance of his rise to become the head of UP as the national university, his formal investiture as the 22nd UP President will be held at the Atrium of UP Mindanao, in Tugbok, Davao City, on Sept. 14 at 9:00 AM.

Jimenez is a labor lawyer and a respected authority on global worker migration. His work has contributed to the establishment of the country’s new Department of Migrant Workers, as well as to the labor migration regulatory framework in countries in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. A former Deputy Administrator of the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration, he served as Labor Attache in Japan, Kuwait, and Iraq, and was awarded Presidential citations for his work in ensuring the safety of Filipino workers during the Israel-Lebanon conflict, including the rescue of a Filipino hostage held in Iraq.

With his extensive background in labor migration, Jimenez has been tapped as an expert lecturer by the UP Centre International de Formation des Autorités et Leaders or International Training Center for Authorities and Leaders Philippines. He has also written papers for organizations such as the International Organization for Migration Philippines and the Blas Ople Policy Center He is a regular lecturer on Philippine overseas labor laws at the UP Law Center’s Mandatory Continuing Legal Education program.

Jimenez served on the UP Board of Regents twice, first as a Student Regent in 1992, when he was also elected Chair of the University Student Council of UP Diliman; and again when he was appointed Regent by former President Rodrigo R. Duterte in 2016, during which Jimenez also served concurrently as Trustee of the UP Foundation, Inc.

He obtained both his Bachelor of Laws and Bachelor of Arts (Sociology) degrees from UP Diliman. As a law student at UP Diliman, he was Associate Editor of the Philippine Collegian and President of the College Editors Guild of the Philippines. He went on to earn his Master in Public Management degree from the National University of Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. He was also a Lee Kuan Yew Fellow at the Harvard School of Government.

Read more about his profile here.

Taking inspiration from and being guided by his Mindanawan and indigenous roots, Jimenez aims to highlight the view from the margins and bring a unique perspective on how UP can further contribute to national development. Championing kindness in the University, and setting public service as a pillar of his vision and strategic initiatives for UP, his administration plans to widen access to UP and UP-quality education through various courses, modes, and platforms, as well as to strengthen partnerships with Philippine SUCs. These partnerships are intended to advance higher education in the country through shared knowledge and expertise.

UP Mindanao, which is hosting an investiture ceremony for the UP President for the first time, is the sixth constituent university under the UP System, and the only UP constituent university in Mindanao with the primary mandate to provide equitable access to quality UP education to Mindanawans. It is headed by Chancellor Lyre Anni E. Murao. (For more news on UP Mindanao, visit their Facebook page.)

November 14, 2023 | Written by Alicor Panao



On October 30, 2023, the Philippines held what is arguably the most impactful elections in the country: the 2023 Barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan Elections (BSKE). The 2023 elections decided the leaders and council members for the smallest unit of government and the primary implementer of government policies at the grassroots level: the barangay. After the COVID-19 pandemic led to postponement after postponement of the BSKE,  the first village-based and youth council elections were finally held after five years.

Two days later, all ballots from 42,001 barangays in the Philippines came in; and the newly elected barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan officials begin their terms at noon on November 30, 2023. Pundits have since noted that the conduct and aftermath of this year’s election, which was marked by a lack of overtime pay for teachers who served extra hours on barangay election day, teachers backing out of poll duties for fear of security threats, and stories of violence and fatal shootings, will influence the midterm elections in 2025.

But the impact of barangay elections goes much further than future polls. This article by Dr. Alicor Panao of the UP Diliman Department of Political Science explains the reason.

The University of the Philippines Diliman campus has become a refuge for at least seven Palestinian-Filipino families who were able to fly from Gaza to escape the genocide there. To continue showing solidarity with Palestinian refugees here and abroad, various organizations sponsored the “We are Palestine” solidarity night in front of the historic Palma Hall (AS Steps) in UP Diliman on December 7.

The event featured live performances, poetry, and messages by progressive groups and individuals. Among them are: Chickoy Pura, Cabring Cabrera, Lolita Carbon, Bong Ramilo, Paul Putian, Musikang Bayan, Plagpul, and Sinagbayan; Bibeth Orteza, chairperson of the Concerned Artists of the Philippines (CAP) and former UP Regent; and Resbak, Sikad and CAP.

According to Francezca Kwe, Secretary of the All UP Academic Employees Union (AUPAEU) Diliman Chapter, the event aimed to show the UP community’s support for the refugees temporarily staying in the campus until December 21. “It also aims to highlight the people’s outrage over the genocide being committed by the Israeli government, with the support of the US government, against Palestinians,” she said.

Promoting Partnerships under UPLB’s AGORA for Sustainability as a Way of Life

 

A delegation from the UP Los Baños, headed by UP President Danilo L. Concepcion and UPLB Chancellor Jose V. Camacho, Jr., participated in the Sustainable Foods London Conference held on March 30-31, 2022 at the Business Design Centre in Islington, London. The high-level conference featured leading speakers from across the foods industry, as well as an exhibition showcasing the next generation of sustainable F&D brands, products and services.

At the conference, Chancellor Camacho promoted UPLB’s research and extension agenda called “AGORA” or Accelerating Growth through One Research and Extension in Action in a presentation titled “Sustaining food innovations under a strong university research and extension agenda”. This marked the first time the Chancellor brought UPLB’s AGORA before an international audience. His presentation gave a snapshot of a few of UPLB technologies and knowledge products for “a resilient, food-secure, and future-proof nation and to promote sustainability to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the UN”. He mentioned seven SDGs that UPLB has aligned itself with through AGORA: SDG 2 or Zero Hunger; SDG 4 or Quality Education; SDG 7 or Affordable and Clean Energy; SDG 11 or Sustainable Cities and Communities; SDG 12 or Responsible Consumption and Production; SDG 13 or Climate Action; and SDG 15 or Life on Land.

“We must take advantage of technologies that facilitate the paradigm shift toward sustainable living. Ideally, this change must occur at all levels of society—from the private individual to the governments, big businesses, and international bodies,” Camacho said.

UPLB was the lone university that participated in the conference and exhibit that brought together over 400 senior food and beverage executives across the UK and the world. The UPLB exhibit also showcased UPLB technologies and knowledge products and activities, such as: the PCR-based DNA detection kits; rapid test kits for pesticide residue; biofertilizers, seeds and planting materials; postharvest technologies; quick tests for soybean meal and rice bran product quality; plant genetic resources; IPB Quality Protein Maize Variety 6; and Sinta papaya. Also featured were: simple nutrient addition program or SNAP Hydroponics; the UPLB Bee Program; UPLB’s own brand of dressed chicken called “manok galâ”; processed meat and dairy products; fruit wines; calamansi fruit juice; and, purple yam or ‘ubi’ powder. The National Plant Genetic Resources Laboratory, where UPLB develops new and improved crop varieties, was featured as well.

 

The 2021 ProSPER.Net Webinar on Sustainability in Higher Education

 

The COVID-19 pandemic was identified by the UNDP to be the “defining global health crisis of our time and the greatest challenge we have faced since World War II”, a health crisis that triggered an equally dire global socioeconomic crisis. The pandemic’s impact on the environment has been varied, however. On one hand, medical and hazardous wastes increased, and plastic and packaging wastes imposed a burden on the environment; on the other hand, research has shown that GHG and other air pollutant emissions have decreased, and the reduced anthropogenic activity has allowed ecosystems to recover.

All of these emphasize the connections between COVID-19, climate change, and the environment, which was the focus of the ProSPER.Net Webinar on Sustainability in Higher Education 2021 held on October 22, 2022. This was organized jointly by the University of the Philippines Diliman and the Ateneo de Manila University, in collaboration with the UN University Institute for the Advanced Study of Sustainability. With the theme “Planetary Health Perspectives: Lessons from COVID-19 towards Climate Action”, the webinar shared insights on our experiences of the pandemic, and reflected on what these meant for higher education institutions seeking to lead social and environmental transformations towards a more resilience society and a healthier planet.

“We need to think about transformations that will benefit not just our own campuses, but the rest of our communities and the entire planet,” UP Diliman Chancellor Fidel R. Nemenzo said in his closing message. “Our universities need to do research to advance our understanding of environmental issues and inform public policy, and introduce the values of sustainability in our curricula to promote awareness of our world and the consequences of our decisions and ways of doing.”

Emphasizing the importance of the academic community in creating new mindsets, new ways of looking, and new ways of living, Nemenzo added: “We need to train a new generation of graduates who understand the connections between economics and ecology, social science and environment, urban development and planetary health—the kind of people who know that the comforts of living should not be at the expense of our planet.”

 

UPD and WHO Philippines on Vaccination Inequities

 

The University of the Philippines Diliman’s COVID-19 Task Force, which deploys volunteers from the UP Diliman community, collaborated with WHO Philippines and other organizations in a consortium to vaccinate more than 650 individuals from the National Capital Region’s at-risk populations. The beneficiaries were vaccinated at the UP Diliman College of Human Kinetics gymnasium on September 24 and 25 and October 22 and 23, 2021.

Individuals of at-risk populations include the homeless, the survivors of gender-based violence, the severely marginalized constituents such as those belonging to the informal sectors, and people at risk of sexual exploitation and abuse.

The activity hit SDG targets, particularly those under 3 (Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages), 5 (Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls), 10 (Reduce inequality within and among countries), and 11 (Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable). The organizers primarily wanted to address vaccine inequity among the NCR’s poor and vulnerable communities and “gender inequities in vaccine rollout.” 

According to Prof. Maria Dulce Natividad of the UPD COVID-19 Task Force: “UPD COVID-19 Task Force was also part of the United Nations Population Fund’s (UNFPA) initiative on vaccines and gender equity. A roundtable (discussion) was organized in April 2021, ‘What’s Gender Got to Do with Vaccines?’ We were a co-organizer then and this led to our partnership with the consortium on the project to vaccinate the homeless/street dwellers and survivors of gender-based violence from Manila and Quezon City.” 

The vaccination sessions in UPD were implemented by relaxing documentation requirements and allowing advocacy groups to register them. 

The other organizers of the vaccination activity were the Philippine Commission on Human Rights, the Philippine Disaster Resilience Foundation, the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women – Asia Pacific (CATW-AP), the Kalinga Foundation, the Kariton Coalition, and the Australian Aid.

Kababaihan, Tungo sa Kaunlaran: Filipino Women Overseas Workers in France

The University of the Philippines regularly engages in affirmative action to encourage wider participation and equitable representation of women within and outside the University. It takes pride in being a strong advocate for giving equal opportunities and treatment to all, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

In line with the 2022 National Women’s Month banner theme, “We Make Change Work for Women,” UP created a platform where women across the world can share their experiences living and working abroad as well as their initiatives in creating a supportive environment. A webinar titled “Agenda ng Kababaihan, Tungo sa Kaunlaran: Filipino Women Overseas Workers in France Women’s Forum,” was held on April 07, 2022. It was organized by the University of the Philippines Open University Office of Gender Concerns (OGC) in coordination with the Social Work and Women Development academic programs of the UPOU Faculty of Management and Development Studies.

The webinar’s resource speaker was Therese Mae C. Aviles-Debayle, a registered social worker, and a student of Master in Social Work in UPOU. She  shared information about   and challenges of Filipino women overseas workers in France, where she is currently based. Among the challenges she mentioned are adjusting to a different culture, language, food, beliefs, norms, and physically adapting to the seasons and way of life.

The forum gave the participants a picture about the lives, experiences, and journeys of women in their communities. Dr. Finaflor Taylan, UP Open University OGC director, was inspired to create social protection structures and programs for OFWs. She  emphasized the need for a support and advocacy group for Filipino women working and living in other countries and encouraged the participants to be part of it or to start creating one.

Recognition of the “Lived Identities” of UP’s Graduating Students

The University of the Philippines takes pride in being a safe space for everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age, social or economic status, and gender orientation. No matter how big or small an event is, in UP one can freely express themselves in their most authentic way without judgment. And that includes one of the biggest milestones of every Iskolar ng Bayan: their graduation.

On July 10, 2022, the UP Cebu and UP Cebu University Student Council (UPC USC) officially announced and posted that they were “allowing ALL graduates who will march on the 83rd Commencement Exercises to wear their preferred attire in accordance to their lived identities in terms of sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression. All graduates will not be obliged to conform to heteronormative standards and there is also no need to ask permission from the administration or prepare a letter when doing so.”

“As long as the graduation guidelines for academic costumes, such as color schemes and lengths, are still observed, graduating students may dress themselves how they see fit.”

Similarly, the UP Manila Student Council (UPM USC) lobbied to do the same. After dialogues with the student body and administration, UP Manila followed suit with other constituent universities in recognizing the importance of letting their graduates express themselves through gender-affirming attire during their commencement exercises.

The UP Manila memo specifically states: “Students will now be allowed to express themselves through clothing as reflected by their gender identity and expression; and use their lived names and preferred pronouns in the university graduation slide deck and procession as long as parental consent is documented.” This is a huge win for transgender, gender non-conforming, and all other gender identities.

UP Diliman Community vs Disruptively Bright Streetlights

 

The University of the Philippines Diliman campus is widely known for its lush vegetation that offers a breath of fresh air for people who are coming from the bustling cities.

The UP Wild, an online community dedicated to appreciating the flora and fauna in UP Diliman and to raising awareness on the importance of maintaining and preserving the campus’s urban green spaces, deemed the University’s newly installed outdoor lights used around its Academic Oval to be a little too bright. This can potentially harm both humans and animals within the campus.

“The lamps around the Academic Oval have way too many bulbs, and their design scatters light to all directions,” the group said in a Facebook post on October 27, 2021. The resulting light pollution creates a negative impact on the campus’s fauna, which includes owls, fireflies, frogs, and other animals. “The lights can confuse them and alter their natural behavior,” the post went on to state. 

Other members of the community expressed their concerns by pointing out how excessive night light can disrupt the plants’ photosynthetic activity. According to the International Dark-Sky Association, an organization combating light pollution worldwide, artificial light can disrupt wildlife ecosystems in a variety of ways. Small insects can be drawn to the intense light, making them more visible for predators and thus drastically affecting the balance of the food chain. Stark lighting can also disturb birds’ migration patterns, which can be detrimental for UP Diliman, known to serve as a home for various avian species.

The UP Wild came up with ideas to combat the high-intensity lighting by fitting the streetlamps with downward shades to diffuse light. “If their design allows, maybe the number of bulbs per post can be reduced or selectively turned on,” the group added.

The UP community showed just how dedicated they are to preserving the environment by pointing out several issues, from as simple an issue as streetlights being too bright. The UP Wild even went the extra mile by showing various research towards this problem and thought of a possible solution to fix it out of respect for the environment and non-human residents of the campus.

 

UP CFA’s Art Rehab and Conservation

 

The famous artworks, “Captivity” and “Contemplation”, were moved to the College of Fine Arts in the University of the Philippines Diliman from their original spot on the corner of University Avenue and E. Jacinto St. Both sculptures, a part of the art conservation project by the Project Management Office under the UP Office of the Vice President for Planning and Development, were created by a CFA alumnus, Idelfonso Cruz Marcelo, back in the 1960s. 

The conservation project was headed by June Mercy P. Dalisay, who said the reason priority was given to these sculptures was their aesthetic and symbolic value. As time went on, it became more apparent that both “Captivity” and “Contemplation” were vulnerable to natural elements and that deterioration was bound to happen if nothing were to be done about this.

In 2020, tests were conducted during the rainy season to observe the effects of constant exposure to both light and very strong rains. “It was observed that the stone had been so weakened that its grains would crumble and fall off the surface with a slight touch,” Dalisay said. “The pressure generated by very strong downpour over the years eroded the surface and has abraded the skin of the two sculptures.”

The arts conservation project commenced on Aug 31, 2020. Under Dalisay’s supervision, the two sculptures were covered in bubble wrap to prevent further exposure to the harmful elements and possible damage. To prepare the hauling, the sides or the perimeter area of the sculptures were also excavated involving jackhammers.

The smaller sculpture, “Captivity”, was arranged to be hauled on September 1, while the bigger artwork, “Contemplation”, was to be hauled the following day. This was pushed to later dates as the heavy rains got in the way.

Finally, on September 13, “Captivity” was lifted using a forklift truck. It was then transferred from its original location on the left side of University Avenue and carefully hauled and transported to the CFA. The same procedure was observed during the hauling and transfer of “Contemplation” on September 15.

Presently, both significant artworks remain in UPD’s CFA. They continue to be preserved and handled carefully so that it continues to stay strong and proud for many Filipinos and art enjoyers to marvel and to be inspired.

 

UPV Lecture-Workshops in History Writing and Cultural Heritage Tourism in Western Visayas

 

Acknowledging the importance of local histories and cultural heritage to national development and social cohesion, the “Tourism Studies on Island-Based Opportunities for Growth in Western Visayas” (TSIBOG) program, funded by the University of the Philippines Visayas and the Commission on Higher Education, collaborated with the Municipal Government of Ibajay, Aklan, and the Department of Education Division of Aklan in launching the project “Bridging the Past, Sailing Toward the Future: History to the (and by the People)” on November 3, 2021. The project trained elementary and secondary school teachers, tourism and planning officers, and cultural workers in conducting historical research and promoting cultural heritage tourism in the Municipality of Ibajay.

During the first three days of the six-day event, several experts in history, cultural heritage, education, and environmental management shared their knowledge and insights through a series of lectures. The speakers included Dr. Michael Pante from the Ateneo de Manila University, UP Visayas Chancellor Clement Camposano, National Museum of the Philippines Deputy Director-General Ana Maria Theresa Labrador, and Dr. Jurgenne Primavera, National Scientist.

The last leg of the event focused on providing training workshops about cultural heritage documentation, writing learning modules, and creating promotional materials for education and sustainable tourism. Prof. Marie Joy Sumagaysay of the UP Visayas Division of Humanities guided the participants during the food-mapping activities and cultural heritage exhibit. Meanwhile, Joar Concha of Assumption San Lorenzo Makati and Yan Esquivel of the UP Visayas Teaching and Learning Resource Center assisted the participants in preparing their final outputs.

The participants are expected to utilize their outputs to educate people about local history in schools and universities, promote local knowledge, sustainable tourism, and environmental protection, conserve tangible and intangible heritage assets, and respond to the developmental needs of their communities.

 

Roll-Out of Modern Electric Jeepneys in UPLB

 

The Academic Oval at the core of the UP Diliman campus finally reopened in November 2021 with the easing of pandemic restrictions. This 2.2 kilometer-long loop, lined with a canopy of acacia trees, has always been a haven for the UP community and the wider public. Whether taking a relaxing stroll, brisk walking for light exercise, or jogging to really get heart rates up, people of all ages were welcomed back, regardless of their vaccination status. Masks were still required and unidirectional movement around the Oval was advised.

Groups of ten people or less were also allowed to use various open spaces within the Academic Oval and in areas around the Philippine Association of University Women (PAUW). They could now have picnics in the Lagoon, Amphitheater, or PAUW; play games and leisure sports in the Sunken Garden; or simply lounge around on benches along the Oval or in the Promenade. Bird watchers and nature enthusiasts could go back to exploring the campus center’s green spaces following years of absent physical human activity. While biking at the Academic Oval was still prohibited at the time, campus biking routes were provided to regulars and first-time visitors so they might still enjoy what UP Diliman had to offer.

As pandemic protocols and restrictions were further loosened in 2022, members of the UP community, students, faculty, staff, and residents, and people outside of UP Diliman have come back to recover what they had to give up during the lockdowns: the opportunity to be outdoors in one of the remaining patches of greenery in the concrete jungle that is Metro Manila. A space that is free and open to all.

 Changes to the higher education landscape brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic remain significant driving forces in the University’s reimagination and recalibration of its approaches to the delivery of education—not only to its students in the Philippines and abroad, but also to the wider population who aim to be lifelong learners. A deeper focus on learner-centered education allows UP to adapt to the technology-driven world and the shifts it creates in learning demands. In times when retooling and upskilling of the current and future workforce is greatly needed, UP responds with the best of its resources. At the heart of its operations is the commitment to perform public service by offering free quality learning resources to all who wish to avail.

Capacity-Building in Fisheries and Aquaculture

The University of the Philippines Visayas College of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences (CFOS) and its institutes had been actively conducting training and other capacity-building programs for fisherfolk, people’s organizations, local governments, and educators before the pandemic. While face-to-face activities and engagements may have slowed down during the COVID-19 lockdowns, 2022 saw these activities coming back in full force.

The CFOS Public Service Program led the “Fisheries Training Needs Assessment in the Municipality of Leganes, Iloilo and Its Environs” for the members of the mayor’s office, municipal council, and captains of the coastal barangays of the municipality. The Institute of Fisheries Policy and Development Studies gave lectures on fishery resources, laws and ordinances, climate change issues, effects of microplastics, and resource conservation and protection to the fisherfolk of the Municipality of Miagao, Iloilo. 

Recognizing education’s role in promoting aquaculture sustainability to enhance the country’s food security, the Brackishwater Aquaculture Center’s (BAC) annual Aquaculture Summer Institute conducted online lectures for senior high school teachers in the Science, Technology and Engineering strand of the Leganes National High School. The BAC is the Institute of Aquaculture’s (CFOS-IA) research facility located in the municipality. The topics included basic principles of aquaculture, aquaculture systems, and basic fish diseases detection.

On a much larger scale, CFOS-IA mounted its three-week public service program for university and college teachers, Training of Educators in Aquatic Mainstream Science (TEAMS), with participants from Ilocos Norte, Zambales, Capiz, Zamboanga, and Maguindanao. TEAMS is intended to further strengthen research and instruction capabilities of higher education institutions offering fisheries and allied programs. Hands-on training sessions were conducted in partnership with the UPV National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology and the UPV Museum of Natural Sciences.

Apart from the training programs for educators, CFOS-IA also had the “Training Course on Catfish Breeding, Nursery, and Management” for Miagao fisherfolk, who had some knowledge about catfish farming but were alarmed by the low survival rate of fingerlings. The course encouraged local fishing communities to maximize their resources. After their hands-on training, the catfish larvae produced during the activity were distributed to the participants to stock and culture.

Team Scallops from the Institute of Fish Processing Technology (CFOS-IFPT) went to Islas de Gigantes, a group of islands off the northernmost part of Carles, Iloilo, to provide training on value addition and good manufacturing practices for scallops, which is abundant in the area. Islas de Gigantes is considered one of the most productive fishing grounds in the Philippines and known for bivalve fishery. It was participated in by members of the Gigantes Federation of Fisherfolks Sector (GIFFS) Fishermen Cooperative. CFOS-IFPT went back months later to conduct “Training on Entrepreneurship: Sustainable Management of a Community-Based Enterprise for Seafood Products” to a much larger audience composed of those already engaged in the processing of value-added scallop products.

CFOS-IFPT then proceeded to Tibiao, Antique to conduct lectures and hands-on training on fish processing technologies to agrarian reform beneficiaries in the municipality. The participants were taught how to make the most use of their catch during peak season, a considerable volume of which was wasted—simply thrown back to the sea or buried—because of the lack of know-how in fish processing techniques.

The back-to-back “Training-workshop on Packaging and Labeling of Priority Products and Introduction to Basic Entrepreneurship” and “Training-Workshop on GMP/SSOP for Small-Scale Production of Fishery Products and Introduction to Cooperative Development and Management” were given to fisherfolk from Ajuy and Concepcion, Iloilo who process sardines, squid, and blue swimming crab wastes, among others. The first was conducted in collaboration with the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) Region VI and with assistance from the Department of Science and Technology Region VI and the UPV College of Management. It was intended to equip the participants with the basic concepts of packaging and labeling requirements of Philippine regulatory agencies, the hows of choosing appropriate packaging materials and labels, and ways to develop marketing plans for their products. The second was still in partnership with BFAR Region VI and with added partners, Provincial Fisheries Office-Iloilo, and the local governments of Ajuy and Concepcion. It was on good manufacturing practices/ sanitation standard operating procedures for small-scale production of fishery products, and cooperative development and management.

Six-Day DOST-NEWTON AGHAM Researchers Link Workshop in One Health Omics

 

The University of the Philippines Mindanao collaborated with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), UK, in conducting a week-long free online bioinformatics workshop, otherwise known as the One Health Omics Project, from October 11 to 16, 2021.

The One Health Omics workshop capacitated Filipino researchers in Mindanao on omics technology, tools and techniques in the surveillance, management, and control of infections in a One Health setting. This was attended by 40 selected faculty members, clinicians, and researchers from different regions in Mindanao. The project can help them in their research work in the region. Due to restrictions during the COVID-19 surge, the workshop was done via Zoom.

The One Health Omics Project was funded by the DOST-Newton Agham Researcher Links Workshop grant from the British Council in partnership with LSHTM and supported by the Department of Science and Technology (DOST)–Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (PCHRD). The workshop is also co-sponsored by the Philippine Genome Center (PGC) Mindanao.

Workshop facilitators included bioinformatics experts from LSHTM: Dr. Taane Clark, Professor of Genomics and Global Health; Dr. Jody Phelan; Julian Libiseller-Egger; Daniel Ward; Anton Spadar; and, Paula Josefina Gómez González.

Workshop participants included: researchers from the PGC Mindanao; faculty of San Pedro College Davao; doctors from the Department of Health (DOH) XI; and, researchers from UP Mindanao. 

Bioinformatics is a new field in health research. With the use of computers, it allows researchers to further examine and understand the characteristics of an organism or a microbe through its genome, such as a virus like the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the COVID-19 disease. For instance, bioinformatics allowed scientists to quickly develop diagnostic test kits and vaccines for COVID-19

“Bioinformatics and genomics techniques, as well as conducting related molecular investigations, are important skills for the participants to become genomics and genomic epidemiological experts and will contribute to improving the health of the Philippines population,” Prof. Taane said.

Social Innovation for Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights

The University of the Philippines Manila, as Philippine hub of the Social Innovation in Health Initiative (SIHI), conducted its Social Innovation for Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights project from 2020 to 2022.

The Social Innovation for Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) project, jointly conducted by the UP Manila School of Health Sciences and Maastricht University School of Health Professions Education (SHE), strengthened the capacity of UP Manila as Social Innovation in Health Initiative Philippine Hub and representatives of partner institutions. The project helped them to be trainers to frontline health professionals and facilitated their design of innovative, multi-stakeholder-driven, community-based interventions in response to SRHR problems. 

Dr. Meredith Del Pilar-Labarda of the Department of Medicine at the UP Manila School of Health Sciences served as the leader for the Social Innovation in Health Initiative (SIHI) Philippine Hub, together with Jana Mier-Alpano and Abigail Mier.

According to Dr. Del Pilar-Labarda, this particular project trained the trainers for faculty, medical students, health officers of local government units, and leaders of communities such as the Sangguniang Kabataan. They can help co-create a comprehensive sexual education and gender issues program that would help adolescents in their communities. Another output would be the publication of a manual for trainers.

This was the first face-to-face workshop since 2020 when the first series of trainings were done online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The participants availed of: an introduction to gender and sex; a workshop on intervention mapping; a short workshop on social media; and, a workshop on gender issues and comprehensive sexuality education. In the context of the “new normal”, the participants from different communities and sectors shared many of their challenges and innovations, including lessons from SRHR programs done in other countries. 

Among the goals of the project were: to reduce the high rates of teenage pregnancy and the spread of HIV; to prevent gender-based violence; and, to help the young generation to become happy and healthy adults. The final training, which aimed to integrate all knowledge and skills from previous workshops, was scheduled for Oct. 10-14, 2022. 

Launched in 2014, SIHI is a global network of individuals, organizations and institutions advocating social innovation in health and advancing research in social innovation.

UP Diliman

UP Diliman in Quezon City hosts most of the programs of the University. Its sprawling campus, which features a lagoon and an open field, has fueled the creativity of faculty and students in its various programs.

Its National Science Complex hosts several units and institutes that have produced unique and innovative research and studies that contribute to the advancement of several scientific and technological fields. Among these is the UP Philippine Genome Center (UP PGC). Instrumental in detecting COVID-19 in the Philippines, the UP PGC was also involved in developing a local COVID-19 testing kit.

UP Diliman also houses the Resilience Institute (UPRI) and its disaster risk reduction and management program, UP NOAH (Nationwide Operational Assessment of Hazards). Partnering with communities, UPRI has conducted training programs that prepare these areas for possible disasters.

Beyond the sciences and the arts, UP Diliman is also home to the UP Center for Women’s and Gender Studies (UP CWGS), a pioneering research and advocacy institution in the country to advance women’s and LGBTIA+ rights and empowerment.

 

UP Los Baños

Farther south in the province of Laguna is UP Los Baños (UPLB). At the foot of Mt. Makiling, UPLB is a recognized leader in agriculture, forestry, environmental management, and veterinary medicine. It hosts the National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (UPLB BIOTECH), which has continuously pursued agricultural, environmental, and health biotechnology research, resulting in alternative technologies and products that are proven useful to farmers.

UPLB is a founding member of the Southeast Asian Regional Center for Graduate Study and Research in Agriculture (SEARCA), aimed at fostering collaborative efforts with partner institutions to enhance graduate education in agriculture, environment, and natural resources in the region. 


UP Manila

In the country’s capital is the nation’s leader in health sciences studies, UP Manila. Home to the National Institutes of Health, (UP NIH), its experts conduct research that has resulted in innovations in public health, emergency response, and medicine.

Hosting the UP Philippine General Hospital (UP PGH), the Philippines’ largest tertiary government hospital, the campus provides medical care to Filipinos from all walks of life. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, UP PGH served as a COVID-19 referral center, exerting its utmost to save lives. Consequently, its groundbreaking Stop COVID Deaths webinar series, the country’s first and only frontline-focused medical webinar series, was honored by the International Association of Business Communicators (IABC) with the 2022 Gold Quill Award of Merit.

UP Manila is also home to the College of Nursing, the World Health Organization’s Regional Collaborating Center in Nursing Development. At the same time, its College of Public Health hosts TROPMED Philippines, which is the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization’s (SEAMEO) Regional Centre for Public Health, Hospital and Environmental and Occupational Health.

 


UP Visayas

Spread across three campuses in islands across central Philippines is UP Visayas. An acknowledged authority in fisheries, aquaculture, and marine science education and research, it is home to several units that conduct studies in support of the archipelagic nature of the Philippines. These are the Brackishwater Aquaculture Center, Freshwater Aquaculture Station, Batan Mariculture Station, and Marine Biological Station.

Aside from marine research, UP Visayas is also active in efforts to preserve and enrich the Visayan cultural heritage. Recently, UP Visayas inaugurated the UP Philippine Genome Center-Visayas, allowing for the training of locals in the collection of specimens necessary for COVID-19 detection, as well as the conduct of testing in the region.

 


UP Open University

Situated near UPLB is the UP Open University (UPOU), the country’s pioneering virtual university. The UPOU provides quality distance education to students both in the Philippines and abroad who cannot attend the conventional in-person classroom setting due to personal or professional reasons. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the UP Open University shared much of its experience in conducting virtual classes with other UP units and educational institutions.

The UP Open University has ten learning centers nationwide, as well as a virtual learning center, with over 31 academic programs for both graduate and undergraduate studies.

 

 

UP Mindanao

 

Affirming the University’s presence in the country’s second-largest island, UP Mindanao was established by law to provide equitable access to quality education. The campus offers various programs in the humanities and the sciences, as well as in architecture, the food sciences, the humanities, and social, natural, and computing sciences. With the addition of sports science, medicine, and engineering to its program offerings, UP Mindanao is envisioned to produce graduates who will become leaders in the region

Madiyaw nga hinaat kaniyo nga tanan!

Honorable Members of our Board of Regents, UP Diliman Chancellor Edgardo Carlo Vistan, the Chancellors of our other Constituent Universities, our University officials, faculty members, staff members, workers, students, distinguished guests, and above all our graduating students today and their proud parents:

A very pleasant albeit rainy morning to all of you, and thank you all for coming today despite the weather. I am sure that we will not allow a steel gray sky and a rush of rain to dampen our spirits, like the sunflowers along University Avenue that remain radiant as ever.

I did not know until recently, when I was approached by Chancellor Vistan, that I was to be your commencement speaker. It is uncommon—if not unprecedented—for the UP President to fill that role, which we usually reserve for an academic, cultural, or political luminary, none of which I consider myself to be.

But having been your President for less than half a year, I thought that this would be a good opportunity to introduce myself to our community, that you might know me and my ideas beyond my standard CV.

This morning, I want to tell you a story.

I am being introduced to you by my formal Christian name. Ako nga po si Angelo Azura Jimenez, abogado at ikadalawampu’t dalawang Pangulo ng Unibersidad ng Pilipinas.

Subalit may isa pa po akong pangalan na nais kong gamitin ngayong araw, bilang pagpapakilala sa inyo ng aking pinagmulan, at ng aking kabuuan.

Ako po si Datu Mankalagan.

Isa akong Manobo mula sa Agusan Valley. Isinilang ako at lumaki sa isang sinauna at makasaysayang lunsod sa wawa ng Ilog Agusan, sa Mindanaw. Ito ang lunsod ng Butuan, na bantog sa Silangang Asya bilang isang mayamang kaharian bago pa man dumating ang mga Kastila. In my city, we say: “Before there was the Philippines, there was Butuan.”

And what a great pre-Hispanic city it was, home to skillful artisans of gold and builders of mighty, ocean-going boats called balangays. Many elements that now form part of the cultural tapestry of our island entered through the Agusan River’s estuary. Its sheer length, one of the longest in the country, ensured that cultural and social exchanges with a larger world penetrated deeply into the heart of Mindanaw centuries before our nation was born.

I love my city. It is my legs, my arms, my mind, my heart. It is the cradle of my deepest affections. It is who I am, today and forever.

The title of “datu” was conferred on me by my people in a solemn ceremony in 2007. A ritual dagger was plunged deep into the heart of a live boar. I heard its vertiginous squeal of pain as it spurted blood and began to die.

A priestess scooped the blood that gushed straight from the heart of the boar before it fell to the ground, and proceeded to paint it on the palm of my hands and soles of my feet, to the drone of her own incantations.

I thought I was going to faint and I never fully realized it then but now I think I know why—life was being ritually offered to give birth to a new one, a new identity. It was an overpowering sensation.

On that same occasion, our elders gave me the name “Mankalagan.” In our local language, it means “great spirit.” I do not know if I deserve the name, and my title as a Manobo datu may be honorific, but the tremendous pride I draw from it gives me the courage I need to speak before you today.

It was not always so. I grew up taking it for granted. I never took the time to officially register as one, nor find the need for it. All I knew growing up was that I had Manobo blood. That was enough. Or so I thought, until something I never dreamed of happened to me—I became UP President, which reminded me of the duality of my character, and why it is important to accept and embrace.

Alam ko pong hindi lamang ito aking istorya, kundi istorya rin ng marami sa inyong kaharap ko ngayon. Malalayo ang inyong pinanggalingan, mga munting pook na minsa’y atin nang nakakalimutan. Naging bagong tahanan na natin ang kalunsuran, ang Diliman.

Like Butuan, I love UP Diliman. It is not always easy to love you, Diliman, but I do.

Because like Butuan, I was raised here, too. Like Butuan, UP Diliman is my arms, my legs, my mind, my heart—the cradle of my deepest affections. Like Butuan, UP Diliman is who I am, today and forever.

When I attained the presidency of this national university, I knew I had to reconcile these two halves of me. They were not in conflict with each other, but were rather the two legs on which I would find my way forward.

Early this year, I woke up one morning and had an epiphany. I would reclaim my Manobo identity, and view the world from its perspective, to seek both courage and clarity of vision. And it came.

My region, CARAGA, is the poorest in our country, next only to our neighbor, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao or BARMM. So, on February first, ten days before I took office, I went up the mountain to a place called Sitio Mahayahay.

In the early morning, in Mahayahay, I took my oath of office as the 22nd UP President before the children of the Lumad. It was a symbolic act. But it was important to me.

Oddly enough, in Bisaya, Mahayahay means comfortable, but life there is tough.

It is a poverty-stricken, conflict-ridden hamlet located north of Butuan City. I was told, in fact, that a few days before I came, a firefight occurred in that area between government and communist forces.

There could be worse places in the country, but I personally know of no place that symbolizes marginalization from the life of the nation—politically, economically and socially—more than the life of the Lumads in Mahayahay.

Jimenez symbolically takes his oath as UP President in the mountains of a conflict-ridden place called Mahayahay in Butuan. “I was always there as a little boy. I took my oath before the children of the Lumad. I wanted to, in my own little way, remind UP where its ultimate loyalty belongs,” he says. Photo courtesy of Father Saturnino Urios University (FSUU) Strategic Communications Office.

I wanted to remind UP, by taking my oath there, where its loyalty should ultimately lie. I needed to take that powerful lesson to heart.

Despite the early morning chill, I had never felt so warm. I was, after all, among my people. Despite the fog that covered the hills, I had never felt such clarity. There, high up in those lovely hills, among the poorest of our people, from the outside looking in, I grasped what I had long suspected about our beloved university.

And it came in the form of three great moral paradoxes.

The first paradox is that the University of the Philippines was founded to provide leaders for the nation. And indeed we have, among the 300,000 alumni who preceded you today. We have produced the most Presidents, the most number of Chief Justices of the Supreme Court, Senate Presidents and Speakers of the House. Throughout the government bureaucracy, you will find our graduates in responsible positions.

In the private sector, you will find captains of industry among our alumni. In fact, among the richest Filipinos, you will find UP graduates. No other University in the country comes close to our dominant position in national life.

And yet, after over a hundred years since our founding as the national university, and still today the only national university in the broadest sense, we find ourselves in one of the most inequitable societies in the world.

We would be blind not to see that poverty, poor health, homelessness and hunger still stalk most of our people. This is an outrage and a ringing accusation against our own self-conceit as the best and the brightest, Iskolar ng Bayan, and University of the People.

This is an existential threat to Filipino nationhood. No nation can long endure under the extreme inequalities we are witnessing today.

The second moral paradox is that access to our university, which we love to call the University of the People, is very difficult for the people. Dedicated in our mind to the highest ideal of equality, are we, in fact, reinforcing and institutionalizing inequality?

I estimate that about 60 percent of our students today come from private schools, as I did. And we all know that while our public secondary schools have produced some of our best students and alumni, there is a yawning gap today between the quality of public and private basic education, in favor of the latter.

Our UPCAT is designed to select only the best, the elite among our high schools. What are the chances of the children of the lumad in Mahayahay of entering UP? Or of the children of Aetas and other lumads? Of the teeming masses of the poor huddled in cramped, under-invested public schools in the country today?

There’s more.

There are around 114 state colleges and universities today and one of them gets 20 percent of the national budget for higher education. You guessed it! That’s our UP.

I have long stopped bragging that we are the nation’s top university. With that share of the budget, we might as well close down if we were not Number One.

One might argue—and some have—that there is no moral justification for just one school, UP, to have such an inordinate share of the budget. Some even say it is because we are simply powerful. But there is actually one.

As the national university, we are mandated under Republic Act 9500, the law revising the UP Charter, to lead in higher education.

Have we?

We all know that there is a huge gap overall between the quality of UP education and the rest of the SUCs. In fact, no other public tertiary educational institution in the Philippines has ever landed among the top 1000 in in global rankings.

Have we simply run away with the biggest share of the national budget for higher education without doing what we could for others?

I believe in democratic access to UP education. And I believe that it is best done by helping improve the quality of education in other SUCs. Would this not be more equitable? Would this not be more democratic access? Does one have to be in UP to have access to a UP-level education? At the same time, we can review UPCAT and our equity-excellence formulas to give our disadvantaged a better fighting chance.

Finally, the third paradox is that the free education you enjoyed in UP today was not actually free. It was paid for by other people who might have needed it more.

Every peso that was spent on your education was one peso less for another Filipino who might have been sick and could not afford to buy medicines.

It was one peso less for housing for another Filipino who could not afford decent shelter.

It was one peso less for a hungry Filipino who could not afford to buy food.

It was one peso less for the education of another student your age who may have had to drop out of school entirely for lack of money.

The free education you got from UP came from many people who needed it just as much if not more, and paid for it by enduring a lower quality of life.

Dear graduates, throughout your UP years, the words “Honor” and “Excellence” have been drummed into your heads. For over a hundred years, we have pledged fealty to these two very personal ideals.

But I ask you now—are these enough?

All of us in UP bear a heavy moral burden to serve the Filipino people. Unless we do, honor and excellence are only for self-aggrandizement, and will mean little to our suffering compatriots.

When I look out my office in Quezon Hall at our green campus—and looking at you today—my heart swells with pride at what we have achieved. But when my thoughts go back to being that lumad on the mountain, gazing past the horizon to far Manila, I recall, with great trepidation, the great challenges and responsibilities that lie ahead of us.

I did not mean to cast a pall on your graduation day but to reflect on what it means to be UP. I actually wanted to speak of hope. And a hopeful story is unfolding right this very instant.

As you all know, last Tuesday, the Philippines National Women’s Football Team, better known as the Filipinas, beat host-country New Zealand 1-0 in the first round of this year’s FIFA World Cup. The whole world is talking about it now.

The New Zealand Team, nicknamed the Ferns, ranked 26th in FIFA world standings, was way above our current rank of 46. In the game, they dominated with 70 percent ball possession. They were touted to win, we were not. In fact, as World Cup debutante, we were not expected to win at all. It took the Ferns 6 World Cup appearances to win their first match ever against former World Champions Norway last week.

How did our team do it? There are three important lessons for all of us.

First, by making the most of their chances. The Ferns dominated the game with 70 percent ball possession against our 30. They had 16 shots at goal, with 4 on target. We had 4, with only one, only one, on target. But that one hit the back of the net, to give us our first ever goal, our first ever win, and in our first ever appearance on the world’s biggest stage, the World Cup.

I’ve watched that magical clip of Sarina Bolden’s four-against-one winning header. The exhilaration I felt could only be matched by the one I felt two decades ago when, as a hostage negotiator in Iraq, I finally, physically grabbed Filipino hostage Robert Tarongoy into freedom and safety right in the middle of the bloody streets of war-torn Baghdad.

It was my own little, personal World-Cup-like moment. But the true prize for me was not a cheering crowd. It was way more precious. Mission accomplished for our nation, I could go back home to the loving arms of my wife and kids, alive.

In Wellington a few days ago, the Filipinas tried to create many chances but, in the end, they managed to produce only one real chance. And that one chance was all they needed."

The Roots of Angelo A. Jimenez
June 6, 2023 | Written by Jo. Florendo B. Lontoc


Jimenez symbolically takes his oath as UP President in the mountains of a conflict-ridden place called Mahayahay in Butuan. “I was always there as a little boy. I took my oath before the children of the Lumad. I wanted to, in my own little way, remind UP where its ultimate loyalty belongs,” he says.

Angelo Azura Jimenez has the distinction of being the first UP Student Regent to be elected UP President and the first Mindanaoan to hold the position. He brings to the table a lived understanding of sectoral representation and the hope and the pride of the people of Mindanao.

Having worked in government, he has also developed expertise in the protection and development of migrant workers.

Family, community, and identity

“Growing up in Butuan, you are close to family, close to church, and close to your friends on a day-to-day basis. We grew up in a very supporting, nurturing environment where there is much trust and very little distrust or suspicion of each other’s motives,” Jimenez described his life in his hometown.

His Mindanao life embodied a unity of cultures, that supported trust in the other. “My family has been there for over a hundred years, and I am a native of the city itself. I am a Manobo and a Christian lowlander at the same time,” Jimenez said. “We grew up trusting each other.

“We grew up playing with our neighbors. We grew up with close-knit communities and families together,” he remembered. “My mother was a high school principal and my grandmother was an elementary school principal. My mother was also a church leader,” Jimenez, who was an altar boy himself, speaks about the many other families connected to their own families through such involvements.

The Catholic school boy, several years later, would also be named a tribal datu by the city elders, who conferred on him the name, Datu Mankalagan or “Great Spirit”. He recalls that ceremony fondly. “It’ll be a great source of strength and inspiration as I face this awesome, awesome job of becoming the twenty-second president of the University of the Philippines,” Jimenez said.

He realizes that his Mindanao line is integral to his UP presidency. “It was when I got elected that people reminded me that I’m the first UP president who came from Mindanao, and I was amazed, actually surprised, maybe a little bit shocked,” he said. “It’s something significant to our people. I never realized that my election would resonate in Mindanao.

“Finally, one of their own has become a UP president,” it has dawned upon him. “I wanted to, in my own little way, remind UP where its ultimate loyalty belongs; and, I couldn’t imagine a more marginalized community than our IPs in the mountains where there has been an ongoing conflict and there still is right now.”

“I was roundly criticized then. I had to just grit my teeth and decide in favor of the students so that they could graduate.” – Jimenez

 

The rise of the student leader

Having lived in a harmonious but diverse Mindanao community, Jimenez did not dream of being involved in campus politics when he passed the UPCAT and moved to the Big City.

“I just loved to write, actually. So when I was in my sophomore year, I joined the Philippine Collegian where I was a feature writer, and probably the longest serving features editor in the Collegian.” Aside from features, he wrote poetry, and many of his poems were published in the Collegian and the Collegian Folio Magazine.

He would become the paper’s associate editor in 1987-1988. Inevitably, he became active in the College Editors Guild of the Philippines (CEGP), of which the Collegian was a founding member and which had turned militant during the First Quarter Storm.

“One time I attended a session among campus writers in Metro Manila, and they decided they wanted me to run as CEGP national president. That was in 1987, and since it’s an organization of writers, I agreed. I won rather overwhelmingly,” Jimenez said about how he started on the path of national youth leadership. As a national leader, he got very involved with the youth and students outside UP. By then he was a freshman in Law school.

“I was always traveling. And I almost neglected my law school [studies]. It was a very challenging time. But after that, now I was in the radar of student politics, particularly student electoral politics,” Jimenez recalled. After his term as CEGP national president, he was asked to run for councilor in the UP Diliman student council. “I started to speak in the streets, in public fora, and it went naturally from there.”

As chair of the traditionally militant University Student Council in 1991-1992, he remembers facing the burning issue of the renewal of US military bases in the country. “We were against it, and I would lead rallies. [UP] would be the largest contingent. It went as far as 5,000 students in UP from all political spectrum and diversity. We were very united then.”

Jimenez, in one of first ceremonies of this presidency, leads the conferment of a Doctor of Law, honoris causa, on Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar bin Ibrahim, whom he cited for, among others, the advocacy of the concept of an Asian Renaissance and a devoted study of the life, works, and teachings of Dr. Jose Rizal.

The Regent and the dilemma of representation

Having been elected Student Regent in 1992, he had to deal with the more complicated issue of sectoral representation. “You have a sector that does not speak in just one voice. And then when you come to the meeting of the Board, you have to come to terms as well with what you call your personal agency, your own structure of beliefs, your ethical and moral structure that you have deep inside you as well,” Jimenez said.

He remembers going against a popular opinion concerning medical students who were refused graduation by the college on the basis of moral fitness. The students and the University Council of UP Manila agreed with the position of the College, Jimenez recalls. He agonized over his vote.

“Upon graduation, they imposed moral fitness and I was a little worried because, number one, it was not in the rules. Number two, I was worried about standards. Who sets moral standards? How do we comply with a particular standard? And what are fair standards that are acceptable to all. And we are a secular university… Whom do we allow to make judgment of our moral fitness to be in the profession?” Jimenez recalled his thoughts back then.

“I was roundly criticized then. I had to just grit my teeth and decide in favor of the students so that they could graduate.”"

Your Excellency Prime Minister Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim, Charge d’Affaires Mr. Mohammad Fareed Zakaria, Esteemed Members of the Board of Regents, Members of the Diplomatic Corps, Chancellor Fidel Nemenzo and Chancellors of our Constituent Universities, To the Presidents of the State Universities and Colleges, Members of the Faculty, Administration, Students, Ladies and Gentlemen:

I feel deeply honored to welcome you to the University of the Philippines—our country’s first and only national university to be so designated. That is because UP, as we call ourselves, represents the noblest of our people’s aspirations. It is home to the minds that shape our nation, and today those minds open themselves to yours—as we open our hearts as well to your party, who have so graciously chosen to visit us.

Of course we are pleasantly aware that for Your Excellency, this is a kind of homecoming, having come to visit UP as a young student leader to seek the counsel of the late and beloved University Professor Emeritus Cesar Adib Majul, our foremost expert in Islamic studies.

This campus would have been quite different then—a bit less crowded perhaps, given the many new buildings and facilities we have since erected. But what has not changed is the strong and unquenchable spirit of liberal and nationalist education that you would have found in UP then.

That spirit has survived many challenges throughout the decades, as you yourself, Excellency, have survived and prevailed over the many vicissitudes of your political life. And thus we feel bound in spirit to your own youthful idealism, your courage, and your lifelong quest for freedom, justice, and prosperity—not just for Malaysia but for a renewed, aware, and vibrant Asia.

The Philippines and Malaysia share a long and special kinship—one of blood and culture—beyond the politics and economics of the present. Our countries both emerged from colonial rule determined to claim our rightful place in the community of modern and progressive nations.

We each have met with our own successes and our own setbacks. And while we cannot easily prescribe one’s solution for the other, given the differences in our societies and historical experience, it is clear that we are beset by many of the same problems—corruption in government, selective justice, socioeconomic inequality, food security, and environmental destruction, among others.

There is much room and reason for our political, business, and academic leaders to engage in fruitful dialogue, and I hope that your visit today will result in new modes of cooperation between our countries and our universities.

And now it is my great privilege to introduce our guest of honor to the UP community."

President Danilo Concepcion, members of the Board of Regents; and the officials of our University; the faculty, staff, and alumni present; the students of our eight constituent universities; distinguished guests; magandang umaga po sa inyong lahat.

Please allow me to begin by extending my gratitude to President Danny and the officials of the University who have graciously assisted myself and my team for the past few weeks as we have prepared for this day. Our goal is to hit the ground running from Day One, and I believe we are in a position to do that because of your help. To all of you, daghang salamat, and thank you for your service to the University.

I am especially grateful to President Danny — or Danny the Builder as I like to call him — for all the work you have done in your six-year tenure as UP President. All of us are challenged to leave this world a little better than we found it; when President Concepcion assumed office six years ago, he took this to heart — and he will leave the University much, much better than when he found it. Walk around this campus and that is self- evident. Thank you very much, Mr. President; and thank you, Gabby, for sharing him with us these past six years.

Our country has just weathered a global pandemic that has triggered massive disruptions in business, technology, labor, and education. These have upended conventional thinking and compelled humankind to hurriedly adapt to and accept new realities.

In this day and age, higher education institutions (HEIs) cannot be parochial and self-absorbed. HEIs need to acquire a global consciousness in carrying their mandates. We need to look at the developments of the immediate past and prepare ourselves for a future in which the pace of innovation is — as AI is teaching us — faster than the speed of thought.

With this as background, the University of the Philippines is envisioned in the next six years to be at the forefront of transformative scientific, cultural, and artistic pedagogy, research, and public service in local and global communities.

Our mission is to foster efficacy, effectivity, and efficiency through transdisciplinary engagements in teaching, research, and public service.

Ang UP ay mananatiling bulwagan ng dangal at ipagpapatuloy natin ang simulain nito tungo sa husay at dangal.

But honor and excellence are not enough. Aanhin ang husay at dangal kung walang malasakit at kung walang pakikipag-kapwa tao?

A transformative UP means no individual or small group effort would probe enough to offer a sound alternative to the complexities we are facing. Though coming from various backgrounds and enjoying disparate privileges, UP has provided and will always provide its constituencies with a common ground to overcome our differences. A passion for knowledge production brought us together and has given us a sense of belonging, which is a strong ground to negotiate between the legacy we share and the future we envision, to better serve our academic community and the world we live in. This is the cornerstone of our first line of action: pumailanlang, pumalaot.

Pumailanlang, Pumalaot is pakikipag-ugnayan, which entails a call for communion. It is a commitment to recognize and respect each other’s worth. And in this sense, we will champion the following:

First, engagement in Transdisciplinary Research, which is also an attempt to end the silo mentality. We must conduct more collaborative research and creative projects among disciplines and among constituent universities, with an agenda of creating translational research that will benefit the country and our people. At the end of the day, the general public should and will always be the target audience of our research. It is our obligation to convert scientific, social scientific, and artistic research into practical programs that will uplift the lives of the Filipino people.

We have to build strong bridges within and between CUs. In our current reality, no single discipline nor single campus is able to provide holistic and comprehensive solutions to the problems confronted by an ever- changing world.

We have to promote and encourage greater interaction and dialogue among UP constituents, such as institutionalization of research programs or curation of creative projects that engage the sciences and the arts in solving social concerns and critically interrogating social issues.

Second, let us also build a stronger pakikipag-ugnayan with our alumni because they are an integral part of the UP community. Their role in providing resources to UP is invaluable. However, they are more than a source of much-needed funds; they are role models for our students. They may also serve as mentors to our students or they can be co-facilitators in extension programs and public services. Our alumni are also our international ambassadors — showing the world what “Honor” and ‘Excellence” with compassion means.

Third, UP must also move forward towards the direction of the 21st century education by building and crossing bridges towards digital technology. UP needs to digitally transform learning in order to be responsive to the period of rapid change in an increasingly globalized environment. In this regard, UP in the next six years will critically participate in the Industrial Revolution 4.0 and we will journey towards the transformation of a learner-centered digital University.

To make this a bit more concrete, digital transformation in the UP context means:

Differentiated and personalized learning: the tailoring of learning content, processes and activities to match each learners ability level.
Digital learning resources: the creation of digital resources that engage students in learning activities and support students’ learning goal.
Global and remote learning: learning from anywhere and at any time.
Administrative efficiencies: the greater use of data science in decision making.

I imagine our CUs and campuses enjoying high-speed networks and the enhanced digital competence of our faculty and staff.

One of the goals of digital transformation is to create compelling digital content in education that include current, relevant, and accurate information that are aligned to the highest quality standards. These user- friendly digital content will be made available to all UP students, regardless of what CU they are enrolled in. As part of our extension service, we will happily share the digital course content that we will develop with other SUCs. Our digital transformation initiative will also expand and make it easier for our students to cross-enroll in other CUs.

Fourth, as a national university, we must also help the nation by reaching out to the state universities and colleges in the regions. With its resources, UP is better armed as a teaching, research, and public service university as compared to its fellow SUCs. As such, we must extend “honor and excellence” to the SUCs by ways of consortium or by assisting in capacity buildings or by sending our experts to aid them in academic program development.

Fifth, reaching out to our administrative staff members is also a very important aspect of this agenda of pakikipag-ugnayan. We will review the benefits our staff members receive. We will also sit down with the Department of Budget and Management and the Civil Service Commission to address personnel and regularization issues on an institutional level.

The second major plan of action is a take on pride of place. We have to envision a UP where spaces are safe, nurturing, shared, connected, and sustainable. This is an opportunity to think of UP as a means to transform spaces into places with meaning and memories. Emplacement is historically and culturally wired; our existence is embodied in space and time. A place has history. It also articulates cultural memory, and in the case of UP, it is an extension of a long history of intellectual, scientific, and artistic traditions.

Pride of place plays an important role in identifying and supporting place- based policy, which includes environmental governance mechanisms.

Pride of place entails community spirit, confidence in an area, and standing up for the community in the face of adversity. The ultimate goal is to involve everyone in the disposition of, “I care, and I want to improve this place.”

We have to maintain UP as an ideal space of learning. Our digital national university will not only be an ideal place to learn, it will also be an ideal place to live and play. Our campuses will be green oases — the lungs of the communities that host them. We will set targets towards carbon neutrality, and in developing our campuses we will abide by the International Good Practice Principles for Sustainable Infrastructure.

Our campuses will also serve as refuge for weary souls that will be rejuvenated though art and culture. UP campuses will be arts hubs. We have to maximize the use of spaces. Our campuses are good venues of found-space performances, site-specific exhibitions, community gatherings and socializations.

With our sense of paglulugar, pagpopook, we are able to craft a system- wide arts and culture policy that will cement UPs place as the leader in arts education, culture promotion, and cultural centers in communities that hosts our campuses.

Dear members of the UP community:
I would like to express my sincere gratitude and appreciation to you all for your amazing response to this crisis—a global situation the likes of which we have not seen in our lifetimes. We have been forced to suspend classes, work and all other campus activities, and to stay inside our homes and practice social distancing, all to contain the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) and to keep our healthcare system from being dangerously overwhelmed. For some of us, the effects of these measures on our finances, work, and social lives, and on our mental and physical health, have been devastating. [Read full text]

COVID-19 Test Kit

What does the NIH-PGC test kit contain?

What does the locally produced COVID-19 test kit contain? These are explained by Dr. Raul Destura of the University of the Philippines Manila National Institutes of Health and Philippine Genome Center to members of the media during the press conference on March 12. While the kit can be dependably used as it is, it does contain a component that allows for a quality control mechanism with the aid of the experts at the PGC.

For Dr. Cynthia Saloma of the PGC, the samples that will be derived from the kit will allow them to analyze the origin of the COVID-19 virus circulating among patients with the disease. It would also allow them to compare this with those found in other countries.

With the test kit and analysis, UP Manila Chancellor, Dr. Carmencita Padilla is confident of the University’s capability, as it does have the necessary equipment to get the job done.

COVID-19: Dr. Raul Destura explaining the process of collecting samples
Collecting samples for COVID-19 is a risky and challenging task. In this video, epidemiologist Dr. Raul Destura of the National Institutes of Health, UP Manila and Philippine Genome Center, explains how it is carefully and properly done. According to Destura, a medical professional who intends to collect samples from a suspected patient should be wearing the following: Personal protective equipment (PPE); N95 mask; gloves; goggles or face shield; water resistant or waterproof laboratory gown.

All of these must be worn, observing the proper donning and doffing so as to prevent the person collecting samples from patients from getting into contact with any contaminant from the kit. The equipment, he added, must also be disposed of properly, abiding by generally-adopted protocols.

ECQ doing good, ‘graduated activation’ recommended after April 30—UP pandemic response team

The enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) imposed over Luzon, along with other interventions, has indeed slowed down the spread of COVID-19 virus, based on “the best available data”, according to a team specially formed by the University of the Philippines to help government make informed interventions against the pandemic.

Estimating Local Healthcare Capacity to Deal with COVID-19 Case Surge: Analysis and Recommendations


The rising number of cases of COVID-19 infections on a daily basis is a serious concern as there are limits to hospital care capacity for patients with serious symptoms (e.g. difficulty in breathing). Should the number of infected people rapidly rise, there may come a time when the hospital care resources will be overwhelmed. The UP COVID-19 Pandemic Response Team, in its latest model run, estimates the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases to reach 9,000 to 44,000 by the end of April 2020. As of April 16 DOH reports a total of 5,660 confirmed cases.

Preparing for a Post-ECQ Scenario: Analysis and Recommendations

The UP COVID-19 Pandemic Response Team releases the results of its projections, analyses, and recommendations to aid decision-making. Here’s what they have found:

The peak of the “curve” is estimated to be seen by the end of April to June
As many as 140,000-550,000 people are projected to be infected in Metro Manila, including undetected, mild and asymptomatic cases comprising probably 80% of the total
Hospital bed capacity and other healthcare metrics can be projected based on the proportion of severe cases (5%)

Queries re the eFOI portal may be directed to:"
APPROVED ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) RESOURCES OF THE UP SYSTEM – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/approved-acceptable-use-policy-for-information-technology-it-resources-of-the-up-system/,"

Section 1. Policy Statement
Computers and networks are powerful technologies for accessing and distributing information and knowledge. They are strategic technologies for the current and future needs of the UP SYSTEM.
For now, computing facilities and network infrastructure are a costly resource and thus must be used solely for teaching, learning, research, and other officially-sanctioned activities. Also, since these technologies allow individuals to access and copy information from remote sources, users must respect the rights of others, particularly to their privacy and intellectual property. There is therefore a need for rules and regulations to ensure equitable, secure and reliable access to these resources. The following regulations will govern the use of computing facilities, networks and other Information Technology (IT) resources of the University of the Philippines System.
These regulations aim to:
ensure an information infrastructure that promotes the basic missions of the UP SYSTEM in teaching, learning and research;
protect the integrity, reliability, availability, confidentiality and efficiency of the IT resources of the UP SYSTEM;
establish processes for addressing policy violations and providing sanctions for violators;
emphasize that the UP SYSTEM shall not be liable for any damages incurred from the use of IT resources and for any claims and suits arising from the unauthorized and irresponsible use of the same;
warn users that use of IT resources for partisan political activities as defined in relevant rules and regulations of the Civil Service Commission or the University of the Philippines, or for any unauthorized commercial purposes is prohibited; and
notify users of the existence of this Policy.
Section 2. Basic Standards
The same standards and principles of intellectual and academic freedom developed for university libraries shall be applied to material received from the network. The same standards of intellectual and academic freedom developed for faculty and student publication in traditional media shall be applied to publication in computer media.
As constituents of the academic community, faculty, students, and academic and non-academic staff should be free, individually and collectively, to express their views on issues of institutional policy and on matters of general interest to the academic body. The constituents of the academic community should have clearly defined means to participate in the formulation and application of institutional policy affecting academic and student affairs. The actions of the constituents of the academic community within the areas of its jurisdictions should be reviewed only through orderly prescribed procedures.
Section 3. Definitions
Agreement Form means document in which the user undertakes to comply with this Policy. The form may be electronic.
Confidential information means data or information which on its face is not intended for unrestricted dissemination. Examples include student records, examination archives, proprietary technical information, disciplinary case records, administrative records, and the like.
Document when used in this Policy shall refer both to the paper and its electronic format.
Information Technology System or IT System includes computers, terminals, printers, networks, modem banks, online and offline storage media and related equipment, and software, databases and other data files that are owned, managed, or maintained by any unit of the University of the Philippines.
For purposes of this Policy, any other equipment, computer unit or external network, when attached to, or used to access and/or interact with any component of, the IT System may also be considered part of the IT System.
Private files means information that a user would reasonably regard as private. Examples include the contents of electronic mail boxes, private file storage areas of individual users, and information stored in other areas that are not public, even if no measure has been taken to protect such information.
System and Network Administrator means a person designated to manage the particular system assigned to her/him, to oversee the day-to-day operation of the system, or to preliminarily determine who is permitted access to particular facilities and resources of the IT System, whether hired on a temporary, contractual or permanent basis.
UP SYSTEM means the University of the Philippines System and all its constituent units.
User means any person, whether authorized or not, who makes any use of the IT System or any of its components by any means or from any location.
Section 4. Scope And Applicability
a. General Coverage.
This Policy applies to all facilities within the IT System and all its users.
All users should be aware of these regulations, and should realize that when using the computers within the UP SYSTEM, they are bound by these regulations. Users may be required to sign a form agreeing to comply with this Policy. However, failure to sign the agreement form will not release users from coverage of this Policy.
b. Local and External Conditions of Use.
Individual units within the UP SYSTEM may define additional “conditions of use” for components of the ITSystem under their control.
These conditions must be consistent with this overall policy but may provide additional detail, guidelines, restrictions, and/or enforcement mechanisms. These units will be responsible for publishing the regulations they establish and their policies concerning the authorized and appropriate use of the equipment for which they are responsible. Copies of these policies should be given to the President, Vice-President for Development, the Intellectual Property Office and the Office of Legal Services.
Where use of external networks is involved, policies governing such use will be applicable and must be adhered to.

respect the rights of other computer users; and
be aware that although computing and information technology providers throughout the university are charged with preserving the integrity and security of resources, security sometimes can be breached through actions beyond their control. Users are therefore urged to take appropriate precautions such as safeguarding their account and password, taking full advantage of file security mechanisms, backing up critical data and promptly reporting any misuse or violations of the policy.

Every member of the University community has an obligation to report suspected violations of the Acceptable Use Policy for Information Technology of the U.P. System or any of its units.

UP President Angelo A. Jimenez delivered the concluding remarks during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) University Leaders’ Forum held in San Francisco, California, on November 13, 2023. 

With the theme “Investing in Tomorrow’s Biodiversity”, the forum was dedicated to sustainability and climate resilience, including sessions on sustaining the evolving biodiversity landscape, strengthening the resilience of coastal communities, rethinking food systems, and protecting water for the survival of humanity. 

The APEC University Leaders’ Forum, organized by the University of California-Davis, the University of California-Santa Cruz, and the Association of Pacific Rim Universities (APRU), brought together presidents of the major Asia-Pacific research universities and leaders from major global corporations and governments to share insights and discuss critical global and regional issues. The forum served as an official collaborative event with the APEC CEO Summit and provided a unique platform to address key challenges and foster collaboration. 

Read UP President Jimenez’s speech below.

 

 

Our troubles are mounting but peace be on all of us. As-salamu alaykum. A pleasant afternoon.

I extend my heartfelt appreciation and congratulations to each one of you as we conclude this APEC University Leaders’ Forum on “Investing in Tomorrow’s Biodiversity.” It has been an honor to share this platform with esteemed leaders, scholars, and visionaries committed to addressing the critical issues of today.

As substantive as our discussions on biodiversity have been, we cannot escape the fact that we are meeting in one of the most difficult and challenging periods for humanity since the end of the last World War. Many parts of our globe are shaking and coming apart under tragic conflict. Poverty and hunger continue to haunt billions of people. And on the immediate horizon, artificial intelligence is posing more serious questions than answers for human civilization.

Against this backdrop, we are all threatened by climate change—not only we humans, but all life as we know it on this planet. And like the most devastating of wars, this change is, as we all know, man-made. We have waged war, as it were, on ourselves, on Nature, and on the future. The question now is whether we can find the wisdom, the will, and the means to make peace with the Earth and ensure our own survival.

We have spoken all day about the severe threats faced by global biodiversity, coastal communities, and the world’s food production systems. We all know the urgent need for sustainable development, and for concrete measures to ensure climate adaptation, environmental resilience, water resource management, and food security, among others.

As we fly home to deal with our specific situations, I suggest we ponder three key questions.

First: Are existing international and national governing institutions adequately prepared to handle the global threats we face today?

We raise this question because we are alarmed by the failure of the annual Conference of Parties or COP to agree on deadlines on the phasing out of coal and fossil fuel and on climate finance to help developing economies like ours manage the difficult climate adjustment and transition programs. At the national level, many countries remain unable to deliver on their mitigation commitments under the Paris Agreement of 2015. Rhetoric is cheap, but the costs of climate change to our economies and societies are real. It is Code Red for the Philippines and other countries in Asia. Alternating floods and droughts have been growing in intensity each year, severely damaging our economy and eroding our food security."
Cultural Kaleidoscope: UP community celebrates holidays with lantern parades – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/cultural-kaleidoscope-up-community-celebrates-holidays-with-lantern-parades/,"


 

From UP Baguio in the north to UP Mindanao in the south and even in virtual space through the UP Open University, the highlight of the holiday season in the University of the Philippines (UP) is the Lantern Parade, a community-wide celebration featuring colorful and creative floats, costumes, music and dancing, and meaningful reminders of the values that UP stands for amidst joyful holiday greetings.

The tradition began in 1922, recalling times during the Spanish period when people carried lanterns to light their way to the early morning Christmas masses or the misa de gallo. In 1934, UP President Jorge C. Bocobo institutionalized the Lantern Parade to give students “a frolicsome activity before the year ends”. The first UP Lantern Parades traversed around the old UP campus in the City of Manila, starting from the University Quadrangle, passing through Taft Avenue, Isaac Peral and Florida Streets, and culminating in front of what used to be the Engineering building, now the Court of Appeals.

Read more on the UP Lantern Parade’s history

Almost 90 years later, the UP Lantern Parades have become all that President Bocobo envisioned and more—a celebration of all that the year had brought and of hope for the coming year, represented through lanterns and performances showcasing the talents of the UP community. This year, the UP Presidential Committee on Culture and the Arts (PCCA) added a twist to the lantern-making tradition in all oft the UP constituent units (CUs) by presenting a unifying theme: “Cultural Kaleidoscope: Celebrating Cultural Diversity in Lanterns”. Awards were given for the best CU lantern as an expression of the Kalinangan Bayan, Kalingang UP campaign of the PCCA, which aims to foster the One-UP spirit while promoting cultural diversity.

Here is a rundown of Pasko sa UP 2023 and the Lantern Parades across the UP System:

UP Baguio

UP Baguio celebrated its Pasiklaban 2023 on December 18 in the form of a concert dubbed “Sumabay sa Himno ng Musika, Makiisa sa Awit ng Masa”, featuring fabulous costumes and musical performances ranging from folk-ethnic to modern pop, from chorale music to full-on dance productions. Not even the rain could dampen the heat of UP Baguio’s Pasiklaban.

UP Baguio also displayed their entries to the PCCA lantern-making competition, showcasing the resourcefulness and creativity of the different units.

UP Baguio capped its Christmas celebration on December 21 with a Community Lunch, with people converging in front of the Museo Kordilyera to enjoy a feast and give tokens of appreciation to various members of the community.

And as an added gift to the UP Baguio community, the Tinig Amianan, UP Baguio’s sole chorale group, made its comeback to the stage after a three-year hiatus by competing in the 15th Inter-school Christmas Chorale Competition at the Baguio Country Club on December 17. The Tinig Amianan performed classic Christmas carols with Maestro Louie Aribon as choir director.

UP Cebu

UP Cebu’s Pasko sa UP on December 20 combined three big events: the Lantern Parade around the UP Cebu Grounds; the “Mr. and Ms. Kaanyag sa Pasko” coronation night organized by the UP Cebu University Student Council; and the Christmas Fellowship.

Filling the streets and campus grounds with bright lanterns and campaign calls, the UP Cebu community gathered to celebrate the annual Pasko sa UP. The event commenced with a lantern parade around Gorordo Avenue, where the four academic federations and the University administration showed their artistry and holiday spirit through their respective floats.

As a bonus, UP Cebu has something new to open the coming year with, literally new, in fact. The College of Science officially opened its new College building early in December, with the opening ceremony attended by UP Cebu students, faculty, staff, and invited guests.

 

 

UP Diliman

Always an event that draws crowds from the general public, UP Diliman’s Paligsahan at Parada ng mga Parol for 2023 was no different. With the theme, “Panibagong Lakas”, the administrative and academic units of UP Diliman and the UP System participated in the parade to showcase their lanterns. At the end, the College of Architecture took first prize in the lantern-making competition, with the College of Science in second place, and the College of Social Work and Community Development in third. Honorable mentions were the lanterns created by the College of Arts and Letters and the College of Engineering. Meanwhile, the much- anticipated lanterns of the College of Fine Arts included the lanterns titled Pusit (first place), Butanding (second place), Pangolin (third place), and Tamaraw (fourth place). For the PCCA’s lantern-making competition, on the other hand, the winning lantern was created by the College of Home Economics.

In her Christmas video message, Chancellor Lyre Anni Murao highlighted UP Mindanao’s achievements in bringing the spirit of the Oblation to their community. “The biggest lesson for me this Christmas season is that the greatest gift we can offer is ourselves—the dedication to serve, the willingness to empathize, and the commitment to uplift others,” she said.

 

UP Open University

The UP Open University (UPOU) featured the lanterns that participated in the PCCA’s lantern-making competition, and the three that took the prize as the best representations of the theme, “Culture Kaleidoscope: Celebrating Cultural Diversity in Lanterns”. As befit the pioneer institution in distance education and open learning in the Philippines, the award-winning lanterns made by the members of the UPOU community incorporated IT and promoted UPOU’s core value of pushing for open education for all.

Paskong Pahinungod: UP Gurong Pahinungod celebrates the holiday with first reunion of GP volunteers – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/paskong-pahinungod-up-gurong-pahinungod-celebrates-the-holiday-with-first-reunion-of-gp-volunteers/,"


In 1993, an article in the Sunday Inquirer magazine asked a question that raised a number of academic eyebrows: “Has UP Lost Its Soul?”

Read the article in full here.

The article released the results of a study by two UP Diliman professors entitled “The Meaning of UP Education”, which surveyed the knowledge, attitudes and values of UP students and faculty. The results showed that UP students and faculty rated the values of honor, excellence and leadership highly, which was to be expected. However, the values of social responsibility, ethics, and morality? Not so much.

This question of UP’s role as national university and the presence or absence of its soul echoed throughout the term of UP President and National Scientist Emil Q. Javier (1993-1999). In response, the Ugnayan ng Pahinungod, the volunteer service program of the University of the Philippines, was instituted across all the UP constituent units, making it the first university-based formal volunteer service program in the country. In 1998, the Pahinungod fielded its first batch of volunteers under its Gurong Pahinungod program, mobilizing UP alumni, students, faculty and staff as “Teachers to the Barrios” to public schools in underserved communities for a period of 10 months.

For the next 25 years, throughout leadership changes and shifts in administrative priorities, throughout national and global crises, the Ugnayan ng Pahinungod’s Gurong Pahinungod (GP) program continued to quietly and steadfastly send volunteers to some of the country’s most remote, neglected, sometimes inhospitable and even conflict-ridden communities to teach basic and secondary education to children and adults as well as conduct various community-based projects that make full use of their UP education and skills.

On December 9, 2023 at the UP Asian Institute of Tourism in Diliman, the Pahinungod’s GP program celebrated another milestone, and one that has been a long time coming: its first reunion of Gurong Pahinungod volunteers, from Batch 1 to Batch 13, hailing from the different UP CUs.

“Nag-isip kami kung paano ba ipagdiwang ang National Volunteer Month [ngayong Disyembre],” said UP System Ugnayan ng Pahinungod Director Marie Therese A.P. Bustos in her welcome remarks. The answer was clear: “Kailangang magkita-kita muli ang lahat ng mga Gurong Pahinungod, dahil ito ay isang intrinsically joyous event. Kasi tuwing nagtatanong kami sa mga ibang GP dati, ang sinasabi nila ay sana magkita-kita kami muli.”

Gurong Pahinungod: Past, present and future

It was indeed a joyful event as the UP GP volunteers from different batches, courses and campuses swapped stories of their experiences as Gurong Pahinungod—teaching classes in a classroom made of little more than wooden posts and corrugated sheets, teaching high school Science and Math to students who were 18 years old or older, and doing any number of odd-jobs to benefit the families and communities of their students.

As one member of Batch 1 recalled: “Kapag naging Pahinungod, kailangang jack of all trades ka. Sa batch namin, noong wala pang allowance, may mga sumali sa singing contest sa radio station. Hindi naman nanalo, pero nakakuha ng P1000 to P2000” to support their lessons and fund their community projects.

“Ikaw lahat!” another former GP volunteer interjected, amidst laughter.

“Kaya napakalaking tulong ng Pahinungod sa akin,” the first volunteer continued. “Ngayong lawyer na ako, jack of all trades pa din ako. Nasa cooperative ako, nasa water district–kahit saan, kasi natutunan ko sa Pahinungod ang kung paano mag-adjust at maging flexible. And the one thing that is constant is: our dedication to serve.”

UP Mindanao Pahinungod Director Michael A. Gatela updated the GP alumni on the current landscape of the Gurong Pahinungod Program, including the deployment of the latest batch of GPs, Batch 13, to areas in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, in accordance with a memorandum of agreement for educational cooperation signed between UP and the BARMM Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education (BARMM-MBHTE). For future GP Batches, including Batch 14 who have recently completed their preparatory training in pedagogy and content, the next target-beneficiary community will be in Barangay Kabasalan, Pikit, North Cotabato, which, as Director Gatela revealed, has only one teacher teaching 250 students.

“The Gurong Pahinungod are ambassadors of UP to the communities,” Gatela added, reporting that the Pahinungod has been expanding its engagements with communities for its programs, including the GP."

Rodelio “Waway” Saway, Talaandig datu, brilliant master artist, musician, educator and current Municipal Councilor of Songco, Lantapan in Bukidnon, arrived November 6 at the University of the Philippines (UP) College of Music to fulfill a three-week sojourn till November 24 under the new UP Diliman (UPD) Culture Bearers-in-Residence Program.

Approved by the UPD Office of the Chancellor on February 7, 2023, and envisioned to shine the spotlight on the promotion and protection of the nation’s indigenous knowledges or katutubong kaalaman and kaalamang bayan, this new program aligns with Republic Act 9500, which seals UP’s mandate, as the country’s national university, to spearhead exemplary academic standards and innovative practices.

Not new to this, the College of Music since the 1960s has had a string of culture bearers as teachers of Asian music in the Musicology curricula, a significant move initiated by ethnomusicologist-composer and National Artist for Music, Dr. Jose Maceda. Ben Pangosban and Benicio Sokkong taught Kalinga music; Ligaya Amilbangsa taught Sulu pangalay dance; Joey Ayala taught instrumental music of the Davao lumad; Abraham Sakili taught Tausug gabbang and songs; and today, Aga Mayo Butocan and Kanapia Kalanduyan currently teach Magindanaon kulintangan. However, Waway’s intensive stay-in engagement brought knowledge-learning to a closer degree of apprenticeship: freer, more flexible time for lots of informal kwentuhan, juxtaposed with jamming outside of the formal class setting and curriculum.

The son of Datu Kinulintang, descendant of revered chieftain-peacemakers of Mindanao, Waway is one of 18 siblings, counting tribal leaders, Datu Makapukaw and anthropologist Datu Migketay or Vic (who lobbied for the signing of the Indigenous People’s Rights Act in 1997), and sociologist-soil-painter Salima among them. His family was instrumental in establishing the Talaandig School for Living Traditions in 1995, which endeavored to keep alive the artistic traditions and cultural values of the community. This became a model system adopted by other indigenous groups, which today has branched out to 14 other barangays by means of a moving school-on-wheels.

Transfixed by the dynamism of the tribal elders in preserving their traditions through teaching, a bunch of multidisciplinal researchers, mostly from UP, worked to bring the Talaandig educational exemplar in 1998 to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC, as part of the grand Pahiyas Folklife Festival in celebration of the centennial of the Philippine Revolution. There, the Talaandig tent constantly reverberated with excitement, as Waway beat on the massive log drums, or taught the audience how to move to the shimmering bell tones and rhythmic foot stamping of the elegant ceremonial dance Dugso, enveloping those who watched in a hushed, mesmerizingly reverent state.

This was Waway’s very first foray outside of his barangay, along with two brothers and an aunt. Little did he know that he was destined for global recognition, as he would soon travel the world to share his music at festivals in Europe, Asia and the United States, and perform with noted artists in venues such as the Quai Branly Museum in Paris, and the Lincoln Center in New York. An innovator, he bridged Asia and the West through his bowed katyapi, a two-stringed lute traditionally played by plucking. He developed an adventurous, contemporary sound that keenly projected his ethnicity as it embraced globality, fusing elements of rock and reggae with indigenous melodies and timbres.

Not only in music did Waway make his mark. He pioneered the art of soil painting in the community, a modern form of artistic expression that sourced organic materials from the environment and colored soil (23 myriad hues) from hills and riverbanks. Through the medium of soil, Waway created a visual avenue for expressing Talaandig oral history and daily life: a woman playing the polycordal zither; female dugso dancers; a family on a moonlit walk; a mother with child at her bosom; a storyteller; flowers and butterflies. Young Talaandig soil painters have won the prestigious Philippine Arts Awards and Metrobank Award.

Eleventh year of ArtGifts returns with “Sari-saring Likhang Sining” – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/eleventh-year-of-artgifts-returns-with-sari-saring-likhang-sining/,"


 

Giving transcends the mere exchange of objects. It is an act that imparts something beyond the physicality of the gift, leaving a fragment of oneself with the receiver. This profound act of sharing, encapsulated in the Filipino term “pababahagi,” is the essence of ArtGifts, a tradition initiated in 2012 during the term of Prof. Emeritus Benjie Cabangis as curator for the University of the Philippines College of Fine Arts (UPCFA) Gallery.

Now in its eleventh year, ArtGifts returns with “Sari-saring Likhang Sining,” celebrating the spirit of giving that has been at the core of this annual fundraising show. The exhibit, featuring 44 artists from the UPCFA’s distinguished faculty and staff, showcases over 160 small artworks in various media, including ceramics, canvas paintings, ink works, photographs, sculptures, and prints – all available for sale.

The title “Sari-sari” serves as a metaphor, drawing inspiration from the humble sari-sari store. Beyond its role as a commercial space, the sari-sari store is a communal hub where meaningful exchanges unfold, and stories are shared. In the context of ArtGifts, “Sari-sari” becomes a point of departure, symbolizing the gathering of artistic expressions and diverse narratives.

Through the concept of “sari-sari,” the spirit of “pagbabahagi” is upheld, reinforcing the celebration of community and nurturing the diversity of people and artistry that define the UPCFA. The exhibit invites all to partake in this collective act of sharing, encouraging everyone to impart themselves through their creations, in whatever form they may take.

You know it’s the holiday season once again when the campuses of the University of the Philippines (UP) come alive in a blaze of twinkling lights, colorful lanterns, and festive music.

Over the past week, the constituent universities of the UP System held their traditional “pag-iilaw” ceremonies to officially launch the celebration of Christmas 2023.

UP Diliman’s most iconic statue came to vibrant life during the recent “Pag-iilaw ng Tatsulokuyan,” held on December 1, 2023 at the Oblation plaza.

This year’s traditional Pag-iilaw, with the theme “Panibagong Lakas,” illuminated the campus and featured an array of musical performances and the artistic installation of “Tatsulokuyan,” by Filipino multi-media visual artist and UP Fine Arts alumnus Prof. Abdulmari “Toym” Imao, Jr.  The title was crafted from the Filipino words “tatsulok,” “sulo,” and “kasalukuyan.”

UP Vice President for Public Affairs Rolando Tolentino, on behalf of UP President Atty. Angelo Jimenez, welcomed those who gathered for the celebration.

“Tulad ng mga parola at lighthouses sa madidilim na kalawakan, ang UP ay magsilbing liwanag na tanglaw at aktor ng pag-asa at pagbabago laban sa katiwalian at culture of impunity o kawalan nag takot na maparusahan lalo na sa edad ng malawakang disinformation, trolling and sponsored trending sa ating lipunan,” said VP Tolentino.

UP Diliman Chancellor Edgardo Carlo L. Vistan II mentioned the four-year transition of “Pa-ilaw” from virtual, to hybrid, then to face-to-face with masks to no masks, marking the evolving phases of the event.

“Ang panibagong lakas ay nakaugat din sa mahalagang tungkulin ng Unibersidad ng Pilipinas na maging lunsaran ng pagtuklas at pag buo ng mga tugon sa iba’t ibang suliraning kinakaharap ng ating lipunan. Gamit ang panibagong lakas na ito, sikapin nating makalikha ng mga napapanatili o sustinabling lunas sa mga problemang ating dinaranas bilang isang komunidad at isang bansa,” he said.

Frequently Asked Questions – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/frequently-asked-questions/,"For more information about UP, please click here.

2. What does constituent university mean? How does it differ from an autonomous unit?

A constituent university (CU) is a group of colleges headed by a chancellor, with a defined vision and purpose that meets the following requirements: it is necessary to UP, the region where it is located, and the country; it possesses the capacity and faculty resources to offer appropriate programs of quality; it has enough personnel items to run on the accepted standard of quality; it conforms to established University standards and requirements in the recruitment of, grant of tenure to, and promotion of faculty, the formulation and evaluation of academic programs, rules on student progress, etc.

A new CU is and must always be created by the University through its Board of Regents (BOR).

A college is a degree-granting unit consisting of various departments, institutes, or divisions, with the dean as head. College can also mean school, provided that the latter offers undergraduate and graduate degrees. An autonomous college, in particular, is one such unit, though it does not fall under any constituent university and is a scaled-down version of a CU. Both college and university enjoy autonomy in the formulation of their thrusts, taking into consideration their regional location and how they can contribute not only to the UP System but to the country as well.

When a college is declared autonomous from a CU, it is usually a temporary status until it meets all the requirements to be elevated to CU status. An example of this is UP Baguio. Since its inauguration in 1961, it was a regional unit of UP Diliman (UPD) and was then called UP College Baguio. In April 1999, the BOR approved its elevation from a UPD unit to an autonomous college under the Office of the President of the University and was called UP Baguio. In 2002, it was elevated to CU status.

3. How can one qualify for admission into UP?

Traditionally, prospective UP students are screened through the UP College Admission Test (UPCAT). It is held once a year in the different constituent units of the University, as well as in select examination centers all over the country. The applications are filed prior to the date of the examinations.

For student athletes, the Varsity Athletic Admission System (VAAS), administered by the College of Human Kinetics of UP Diliman, awards slots to exemplary applicants who may not have taken or passed the UPCAT, after a stringent system of tryouts. VAAS students are required to represent the university in national or international sports competitions to maintain their status as UP students.

In light of the public health situation brought about by the spread of COVID 19, the University has adopted a different admissions process which will allow for the application, selection and admissions of applicants who can meet the rigorous requirements of UP. For more details on the process, please visit the Office of Admissions website: upcat.up.edu.ph.

4. What are the degree courses offered by UP?

UP offers several undergraduate degree non-baccalaureate degree programs. For a full list, please visit this page from the Office of Admissions."

Dr. Eva Maria Cutiongco-de la Paz

If there is anything that Dr. Eva Cutiongco-de la Paz seems not to enjoy, it’s getting undue credit. The winner of the 2018 Dangal ng Bayan Award was admittedly nervous when her mother, a former faculty member at the UP College of Education, suggested having their photo taken with the tarpaulin celebrating her feat.

“I was hoping nobody was there,” she said, “and that nobody would recognize me when we were having our family picture taken at the Oblation Plaza.”

As far as her research is concerned, Cutiongco-de la Paz is quick to laud the contributions of her collaborators over her own. The clinical geneticist and current executive director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has certainly published on a broad range of subjects, from the genes implicated in rare diseases to our population’s genetic diversity. When asked, she tends to downplay her role in each of them. “None of these is just about me,” she says.

University of the Philippines Principles for Responsible and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/up-principles-for-responsible-artificial-intelligence/,"
In this document, AI is appreciated as machines that exhibit a certain level of human or animal intelligence, capable of problem-solving, decision-making, learning, and rational behavior. Further, AI is also a “socio-technical system” where “the processes used to develop [this] technology are more than their mathematical and computational constructs.”¹ Fully understanding AI means taking into account”the values and behavior modeled from the datasets, the humans who interact with them, and the complex organizational factors that go into their commission, design, development, and ultimate deployment.”²

Although the spread of AI provides excellent opportunities, it also creates significant risks.

AI makes lives easier by automating tasks and providing information and recommendations that suit individual needs. It is harnessed in making decisions on who gets a job, who is approved for a loan, what kind of medical treatment a patient receives, and what communities get policed.

AI can also be an essential tool for development. Al systems can revolutionize healthcare, transportation, and agriculture; aid in responding to climate issues; help in addressing poverty and hunger; and enhance personalized learning and improve education management. A study on AI and sustainable development goals (SDGs) published in 2020 revealed that “AI can enable the accomplishment of 134 targets across all the goals.”³

However, the adoption of AI has led to increasing risks and hazards.

The 2023 AI Index Report indicates that incidents of “ethical misuse of AI has increased 26 times since 2012.”⁴ Some experts are worried that people will misuse these systems to spread disinformation.

Estimates show that AI deployment in the economy could also lead to massive job losses. The previously cited study on AI and SDG also reported that AI “may also inhibit 59 [SDG] targets.”⁵ In education, AI challenges include access for marginalized groups of students and privacy violations, such as unethical data collection and processing. Currently, many are worried that ChatGPT, Google Bard, and other generative AI applications open the door to cheating and plagiarism. There are also a few who fear that AI could slip out of human control.

The Philippines is committed to utilizing AI for development. The Department of Trade and Industry has developed an AI roadmap focusing on four areas: (1) digitization and infrastructure, (2) research and development, (3) workforce development, and (4) regulation. The Emerging Technology Development Division (ETDD) of the Department of Science and Technology-Philippine Council for Industry, Energy, Emerging Technology Research, and Development (DOST-PCIEERD) issued a report titled Artificial Intelligence and Information & Communications Technology. According to the secretary of the Department of Information and Communications Technology, “…government should come in and find ways to regulate it to ensure that AI is beneficial, that it is interoperable, it is transparent, and it is accountable.”⁶

AI is seen to “make a significant contribution to the Philippine economy by 2030.”⁷ In terms of use, the Generative AI Global Interest Report 2023 revealed that the Philippines has “the highest monthly search volume for AI tools overall: 5,052 per 100,000 population, mostly for text Al.”⁸ However, in Government AIReadiness 1ndex2022, referring to a government’s readiness to use AI in delivering public services, the Philippines ranked of 181 countries.⁹ While it scored higher than the global average, it lags behind Singapore (2nd) Malaysia(29th ), Thailand (31st ), and Indonesia (43rd).

The University of the Philippines (UP) is actively engaged in developing AI in the country. AI is taught at the undergraduate and graduate levels. UP has the country’s first Ph.D. program in AI, and UP faculty members and researchers are active in AI development. The UP Center for Intelligent Systems will conduct transdisciplinary research and education on artificial intelligence, data science, and complex systems.

For a national university that is committed to developing Al in the country, the challenge remains: how to promote positive and responsible use of AI and mitigate its negative consequences. It is therefore adopting the following Principles for Responsible and Trustworthy AI in order to provide guardrails and indicate the way forward on the development and use of AI in the University and the country.

It is also hoped that the adoption of these principles shall intensify the national discourse on the role of AI in national development.

University of the Philippines Principles for Responsible and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence

1. COMMON GOOD. AI should benefit the Filipino people in particular, and humanity, in general by fostering inclusive economic growth, effective governance, sustainable development, and enhanced well-being while protecting the environment. AI systems should further the rule of law, human rights, and democracy.

2. EMPOWERMENT. AI should promote self-determination and bolster the capacity of humans to shape their future. Particularly, AI must empower vulnerable and marginalized groups.

3. CULTURAL SENSITIVITY. AI systems must be culturally responsive and culturally sustaining. Cultural norms, values, beliefs, and practices of users must be respected in designing, developing, and deploying AI systems.

4. PRIVACY. AI systems must incorporate privacy-by-design principles. Informed consent from users and maintaining the confidentiality of personal information must be upheld, when users provide information and when the system collects information about the users.

5. ACCOUNTABILITY. Individuals, groups, departments, institutes, colleges, and constituent universities involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI must take responsibility for the consequences of their actions. UP shall put into place mechanisms to hold the relevant stakeholders accountable for the AI systems actions and outcomes.

In Research and Development

6. MEANINGFUL HUMAN CONTROL. Humans should have decision-making authority over the AI ‘s actions, decisions, and behaviors. AI systems should not operate in an unpredictable or unmanageable manner.

7. TRANSPARENCY. People should be able to understand how AI systems work. Individuals should be informed if AI-enabled tools are used. To the extent possible, the methods should be explainable. Finally, users should be able to understand AI-based outcomes and identify ways to seek remedies to harms that they may cause.

8. FAIRNESS. AI should be evaluated for gender bias, other forms of unfairness, and all forms of discrimination, especially in the data, models, and algorithms that are used. Collaborative procedures should be in place to actively identify, mitigate, and remedy these harms. AI developers should be mindful of its unintended consequences.

9. SAFETY. AI should never endanger lives. AI systems must function securely and safely. AI systems must be robust. In this context, robustness refers to the capacity of AI systems to endure and surmount adverse circumstances, including digital security threats. Compromising safety and security is unacceptable.

10. ENVIRONMENT FRIENDLY. AI should be evaluated in terms of its impacts on sustainability. AI models and tools must minimize risks to the environment. Developers should use computing resources more efficiently.

In Education

11. PRIMACY OF LEARNING GOALS. Decisions on the use of AI in teaching should start with the educational needs and priorities of learners, UP shall adopt AI systems that promote learner-centered pedagogy and foster collaborative and social learning. AI shall be used to improve the assessment of multiple dimensions of competencies and outcomes.

12. HUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT, UP shall strengthen existing programs and develop new ones to ensure that the country’s Al workforce is highly skilled and ethical. These programs shall target women and other groups that are often excluded.

13. CAPACITY BUILDING. All members of the UP community must be AI literate. Additionally, faculty members must be trained in effectively using and integrating AI into teaching and learning practices. These two initiatives are necessary if faculty and students are to jointly innovate and benefit from the new technology as it further evolves.

14. EDUCATION MANAGEMENT AND DELIVERY. AI should improve university decision-making; make for more efficient administration, including admissions, enrollment, registration, human resource management, procurement, and inventory; and enable prompt regulatory compliance.

15. COLLABORATION. UP shall work with other universities, colleges, and research institutions to share best practices, co-develop AI courses and programs, undertake joint research and development, and advocate for responsible and trustworthy AI.

These Principles for Responsible and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence shall serve as guardrails for our community and stakeholders.

Tensions are anticipated between these principles; hence, there is a need for policies, programs, and protocols that balance innovation and regulation.

Towards this, a multidisciplinary UP AI Advancement Committee (AIAC) is established.

The ultimate goal of the AIAC is to create an empowering environment where members of the UP community can continue to openly discuss the benefits and concerns associated with using AI and continue to come up with better policies and guidelines. This environment should also encourage the development and co-creation of AI tools among stakeholders. The AIAC shall also create a culture of cooperation, trust, and transparency among the university community, private sector, civil society, government, international organizations, and other stakeholders.

Immediately, the AIAC shall draft, for approval of the UP President, issuances to operationalize the development, deployment, and use of responsible and trustworthy AI. These issuances include, but are not limited to, the development of the following:

AI code of conduct based on the above-mentioned principles;
AI development program to accelerate AI research and development in the University;
Implementing framework for AI in UP education, including an Al literacy program, a faculty and staff upskilling program, and a research and teaching program on AI in
society; and,
AI and digital infrastructure development to support the use of Al in teaching, research, and use. This includes providing equitable access to AI by members of the UP community

The UP President will appoint the chair and members of the AIAC and shall provide the necessary support for the committee to be able to discharge its functions.

A multi-sectoral UP AI Advisory Board (AIAB) is also created."
The UP Charter – University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/the-up-charter/,"Under its Charter of 2008 (RA 9500), UP is mandated to perform its unique and distinctive leadership in higher education and development.

 "
University of the Philippines,https://up.edu.ph/university-history/,"Act No. 1870 authorized the Governor General to establish the University in the “city of Manila, or at any point he may deem most convenient.” The UP was to give “advanced instruction in literature, philosophy, the sciences and arts, and to give professional and technical training” to every qualified student regardless of “age, sex, nationality, religious belief and political affiliation.”

According to UP’s Bulletin No. 1, the University was seen as “the logical outgrowth and culmination of efforts made during the past ten years to establish a complete system of education for the Philippine islands.”

Over the past one hundred years, the University of the Philippines has evolved from the pinnacle of the American-established educational system in the country, to a “University for the Filipino” as envisioned by its first president, Murray Simpson Bartlett.


The early years

UP first opened on Calle Isaac Peral (now United Nations Avenue) and Padre Faura in downtown Manila in 1909, with: the College of Medicine (which, as the Philippine Medical School established in 1905, predated the University by three years); the School of Fine Arts (1909); the College of Liberal Arts (1909); the College of Veterinary Medicine (1910); the College of Engineering (1910); the College of Law (1910); and, the College of Agriculture in Los Baños, Laguna (1906).

The UP president at that time, Murray Bartlett, vowed that, as a “University for the Filipino,” UP must be “supported by the people’s money,” with a charter framed by the people’s representatives and “its hope based on the confidence and sympathy of the people.”

 


In 1915, a lawyer, Ignacio Villamor, would be chosen president of the University. He would be the first Filipino to lead what had by that time grown to become the Philippines’ premier higher educational institution. Under Villamor, UP continued to grow with the addition of units such as: the Conservatory of Music; the University High School; the College of Education; and, the Junior College in Cebu City.

In 1935, UP’s famous statue, the Oblation, was installed at the Manila campus. The statue was the creation of National Artist Guillermo Tolentino and inspired by his interpretation of the second stanza of Dr. Jose Rizal’s “Mi Ultimo Adios.”


The Transfer to Diliman

The Second World War saw the destruction of several buildings of UP in Manila, Los Baños, Cebu, and Iloilo. In 1947, the Philippine General Hospital formally became a part of UP through Executive Order No. 94. In 1948, under the stewardship of UP President Bienvenido Gonzales, much of UP was transferred from its campus in Manila to a bigger campus in Diliman, Quezon City.

The 50’s and 60’s saw the transformation of UP from the brainchild of American hopes and dreams for the Philippines into a bastion of intense nationalism. UP President Vicente Sinco preserved the University’s integrity from communist paranoia and partisan politics, while UP President Carlos P. Romulo introduced Filipinism, student activism and faculty dissent.

 


The First Quarter Storm

UP President Salvador P. Lopez would see the culmination of UP’s freedom-loving, activist spirit facing off against a rising autocracy, from the events of the first quarter of the year 1970, now dubbed the “First Quarter Storm,” to 1971 when the Diliman Republic become the Diliman Commune. From January to February, the campus became a battleground between militant students protesting the deteriorating conditions of the country, and policemen.

The students completely barricaded the campus and established full control of the facilities. There were several attempts by the police to mount an assault on the campus, but they were unsuccessful. The student barricades at Palma Hall and the University Avenue in the Diliman campus rose again during the time of UP President Edgardo Angara, this time in protest against a tuition hike.

The nationalist and activist spirit of the First Quarter Storm would continue to burn within the University through the succeeding decades, firmly establishing UP as the bulwark of critical thinking and free speech, and a haven for the voiceless and marginalized. A new call arose to counter state authoritarianism and foreign intrusion in the country’s state of affairs: “Serve the people.”

Development and expansion

The University continued to develop and expand through the years, even as it navigated through the conditions of a dictatorship. Development-oriented programs and institutions were established, such as: the Institute for Small-Scale Industries, the Population Institute, and the Asian Labor Education Center (now the School of Labor and Industrial Relations) in UP Diliman, and the Dairy Training and Research Institute in UP Los Baños, all of which were founded during the time of UP President Romulo.

Also established were: during the term of UP President Lopez, the Agrarian Reform Institute at the College of Agriculture, the Institute of Social Work and Community Development, the Philippine Center for Economic Development, the Institute of Fisheries Development and Research, and the Marine Sciences Center; the Institute of Agricultural Engineering and Technology, the Transport Training Center, the National Institute of Biotechnology and Microbiology, and the Third World Studies Program during the succeeding terms of UP Presidents Onofre D. Corpuz and Emanuel V. Soriano; and, the National Institute of Geological Sciences, the Natural Sciences Research Institute, the National Institute of Physics, and the Center for Integrative and Development Studies, under UP President Edgardo J. Angara.

By the mid-70s, UP had become a multi-campus University, with UP Los Baños granted autonomy in 1973; the Health Science Center in UP Manila, in 1977; and UP Visayas, in 1979. UP Diliman would be declared an autonomous campus in 1985 retroactive to 1981. Other UP campuses included: UP College Baguio, UP College Cebu, UP College Tacloban, UP College in Clark Air Base, and UP Extension in San Fernando, Pampanga.

Social transformation and service to the nation

Through the next two decades, UP looked inward through constant self-examination and toward promoting social transformation that aimed to build a just, humane and democratic society. The review of academic programs and General Education programs were conducted so as to make these relevant and meaningful to the development of Philippine society, even as the University continued to expand. Student financial assistance and socialized tuition programs were established; issues in the use of the Filipino language were tackled; and programs to enrich Filipino culture and arts were expanded, parallel to the drive toward modernization and the focus on science and technology.

UP extended its resources and expertise to aid communities and regions affected by the massive earthquake of 1990 and the historic eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in 1991. Indeed, in the 1990s, UP deepened its tradition of service to the nation by harnessing the spirit of volunteerism and selfless service through the Ugnayan ng Pahinungod or Oblation Corps. The University also sought to democratize access to UP education by opening two more constituent universities in 1995: UP Open University and UP Mindanao.

A national university in the 21st century

As the world moved inexorably toward globalization, greater interconnectivity and a knowledge-based economy due to rapid advancements in information and communication technology, higher education institutions were compelled to rethink their roles. Under the successive terms of UP Presidents Francisco Nemenzo, Emerlinda R. Roman, Alfredo E. Pascual, and Danilo L. Concepcion, UP was no exception.

For the first two decades of the 21st century, physical infrastructure across all the constituent units were modernized so as to keep up with the evolving demands of the Information Age. This included: improving Internet and WiFi facilities for greater connectivity within and among the different constituent universities; automating libraries; conducting academic and administrative processes online; and, constructing and improving facilities and laboratories for teaching and research in science and technology, recognized as the drivers of economic development.

The academic infrastructure was also bolstered through improvements in faculty support, student assistance and accessibility, and through incentives for scientific and creative endeavors. The University’s General Education Program, which instilled and nurtured the Tatak UP among its students, was continually reviewed and revised in light of the changing contexts and conditions of the 21st century. Internationalization also gained prominence, with UP embracing accreditation and international benchmarking so as to fulfill its mandate to become a top regional and global higher education institution.

The year 2008 was a significant one for UP for two reasons. First, it was the year the University celebrated its first 100th anniversary. And second, it was the year Republic Act No. 9500, “An Act to Strengthen the University of the Philippines as the National University,” was signed into law, amending Act No. 1870 and establishing UP as the country’s national university. With this—and with UP Baguio attaining the status of constituent university in 2002 and UP Cebu in 2010—the University of the Philippines was redefined as the UP System composed of constituent universities.

Changing paradigms, constant values

By 2017, UP had grown into a massive University System consisting of eight constituent universities located in 17 campuses throughout the Philippine archipelago. Under its Charter of 2008, UP is mandated to perform its unique and distinctive leadership in higher education and development in multiple roles: as a teaching university, a graduate university, a research university, a public service university, and as a regional and global university. Underpinning the expansion of its role in national development, however, is the University’s unchanging commitment to its guiding principles of honor and excellence in the service of the country—a true “University for the Filipino.”

UP continues to grow and expand, building cutting-edge facilities and improving existing ones in order to create an optimal environment for learning and knowledge creation. Its community of scientists, researchers, experts, artists and humanists continue to put UP on the global map of breaking and cutting-edge research, such as the discovery in 2019 of a new human species, the Homo luzonensis, by an international multidisciplinary team led by a UP associate professor.

In keeping with UP’s mandate to serve the needs and aspirations of the Filipino people, UP scientists and researchers continue to harness their research to meet the needs of and help develop Philippine industries, communities and the general public. UP students also continue to win recognition in national and international circles in every field, from science and engineering to music and the arts.
